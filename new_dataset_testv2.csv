1,John Nery,"The answers she gave in two Senate hearings were mystifying, and deeply problematic. But then the public discourse swirling about her is equally cringeworthy. The views expressed by the writer are his/her own and do not necessarily reflect the views or positions of Rappler. There IS reason to think that she was a mere stand-in for some principal. She said she didn’t know who some of her fellow incorporators were (even though some of them were also listed as incorporators in other businesses she was a part of); she said she didn’t know how much rental income the Baofu compound in Bamban earned, even though she said that before divesting she owned 50% of the company; she said she couldn’t say exactly how much her businessman-father gave her, or how often, but only that the money came in large amounts – half a million, or a million, or 2 million, at a time. There IS reason for the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC), which led the raid on the Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) located in the compound, to believe that she remains involved in Baofu. Part of the evidence trail leads back to her: A letter of no objection she filed on behalf of Hongsheng Gaming Technology, the original company with a POGO license; utility statements for Hongsheng up until November 2023, six months after its license had been canceled and over a year since Guo became mayor; a vehicle in the compound registered to her; a current Tarlac Electric Cooperative bill in her name and title (“Mayor Alice Guo, Pandan, Bamban”). There IS reason for the Department of the Interior and Local Government to seek her preventive suspension. The mystery of the missing grinders and grinder operators is proof of the kind of costly foot-dragging that a sitting mayor can force an entire bureaucracy to adopt. One Friday after the raid, PAOCC enlisted the cooperation of Bamban-based grinder operators to open all the 27 safes and vaults found in the compound the following Monday. That Monday, none of the equipment could be found, and all the operators, whether working for the municipality or in the private sector, were away on what PAOCC was told was a town-sponsored seminar. PAOCC ended up using acetylene torches. And there IS reason for the public to suspect her citizenship was not genuine. The discrepancies in the wedding dates of her listed parents as recorded in her birth certificate (registered when she was already 19) and in the birth certificates of two of her siblings; her own insistence that her father was a Chinese national but all the children’s birth certificates identified him as Filipino; the negative certification from the Philippine Statistics Authority that there is no record of birth of either Angelito Guo or Amelia Leal and no record of their marriage – these irregularities are concerning. But of equal concern, in my view, is the heat and hate, the virulent vitriol, of public opinion about her. Two aspects of the current public discourse swirling about Mayor Guo should give us pause. Filipino racism. In the May 22 Senate hearing, committee chair Senator Risa Hontiveros was careful to say at the start that the issue of Mayor Guo’s citizenship was directly related to the issue under investigation – if unscrupulous operators were using POGO as legal cover to run criminal syndicates that trafficked in persons and forced them into criminal acts. Whether Guo is a Filipino citizen is germane to her ownership of various companies, and of course to her eligibility as mayor. The controversy caused by her two appearances in the Senate has generated a tsunami of social media memes. In my own view, the funniest, but also the most searing, was the juxtaposing of two captioned images from two Senate hearings: above, Guo shown speaking her most memorable line (“Lumaki po ako sa farm” – literally, I grew up on a farm), and below, Senator Cynthia Villar, wife of the country’s richest man and symbol of a business empire with a reputation for turning agricultural land into commercial property, with the imagined caption “Saang farm ba ‘yan (Where is that farm)? A joke very like a condominium: Many levels! But together with all the funny came all the ugly. Guo has been deservedly criticized for her lapses in memory or general evasiveness, but she has also been hated on, insulted, mocked, reviled, for how she looks, how she sounds, how her tongue moves, how Chinese she must be. That is racism, plain and simple. Old attitudes against the Chinese in the Philippines lurk not too far beneath the surface. Scratch the skin, and the insults, the condescension, the paranoia, come spilling out. The trigger doesn’t have to be a controversial mayor’s obvious nonsense under oath; it can be anything, even superlative and exemplary achievement. I remember the case of Tiffany Grace Uy, who graduated summa cum laude from the University of the Philippines in 2015 with the highest general weighted average since before World War II: a 1.004. That new record was headline news, before it became social media fodder. An idiot posted: “Another Chinese blood…listed in the history of UP, a University suppose [sic] to be for FILIPINO and for POOR.” Another wrote: “Chinese amp (short for the expletive ‘amputa,’ itself short for ‘anak ng puta’ or son of a whore) wala bang pure Pinoy naman (is there no pure Filipino this time)?” A third idiot, feeling the compulsion to say something smart, wrote: “Ask her what she’s gna (gonna) do about China’s territorial grabbing – if she is our president now. She will fail.” In comments like these, we can see the familiar patterns of anti-Chinese racism in the Philippines: They know how to make money, they are not true or pure Filipinos, they are not loyal to the Philippines. To be sure, under Xi Jinping’s leadership, Beijing’s aggressive expansionism in the South China Sea and especially in parts of the West Philippine Sea have deepened concerns among the Philippine public; since at least 2012, a steady pulse of majority support beats for a more assertive Philippine response. The possibility that Mayor Guo is not only complicit but actively taking part in a Beijing-directed conspiracy to infiltrate the Philippine political class has of course not been ruled out; the inquiry is continuing. It adds fuel to the fire. But that fire threatens to singe, or even consume, many innocents: good Filipino citizens of Chinese ancestry, who like many of their forebears have chosen to devote their lives to the country. Political sensationalism. As a direct result of the controversy Guo provoked in the May 7 hearing, the next one, on May 22, not only attracted a larger audience but also drew more senators. In previous hearings, it had only been Hontiveros and an equally hardworking Senator Sherwin Gatchalian directing the inquiry. This time, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada and senators Raffy Tulfo and Loren Legarda joined the fray. In over a quarter-century of journalism, I’ve seen many old truths upended, but the power of the Senate to direct national attention remains largely true. Even in a fragmented media landscape, the Senate retains enough political and media capital to set the public agenda; consider Pharmally, or the pastillas scam. As a counter-example, consider the House of Representatives; only a tiny fistful of House investigations end up shaping public opinion. If the larger political objective is to generate public support and momentum to finally stop the operation of POGOs in the Philippines, then the presence of additional senators can only be an advantage. Someone like Tulfo, who created an alternative information infrastructure based on delivering justice to ordinary citizens and then converted that into a political base, is especially welcome. And yet. The public appeal that returned Estrada to the Senate and placed Tulfo in its inner sanctum is built on a kind of political sensationalism, an appreciation of politics as theater, offering spectacle and, occasionally, even catharsis. I did not expect either Estrada or Tulfo to have undertaken the same preparations for the hearing as Hontiveros and Gatchalian, who have been at the POGO-as-scam-hub issue for much longer. Estrada tried to offer something new, but in a way that was teleserye-like. He said he had received information that a mayor from Pangasinan province was a) Mayor Guo’s lover or partner and b) he was the one actually running the POGO business in Tarlac. Guo denied the double insinuation. Estrada and Guo then engaged in an exchange, lasting several rounds, of sly accusation and repeated denial that the people gathered in the Senate session hall found amusing. Hontiveros had to admonish Guo, reminding her that it was “no laughing matter.” But it was entertainment – precisely of the kind we have come to expect from Estrada, who inherited his father’s gift. Tulfo did not offer any new information; instead, he contributed his theory of human psychology, an essential feature of his shows. At one point, he criticized Guo for failing to respond with what he called “but natural and human reaction.” At another point, refusing to accept that the issue of bloodlines and family relations was, as Guo said, a sensitive issue for her family, he said that Guo should have told off her father: “C’mon, Dad. Give me a break. Tell the truth. I deserve the truth, right?” To this cinematic cliche, Tulfo added a pronouncement. “Oh, you didn’t ask that? I don’t believe you.” Instead of entertainment, Tulfo offered severity of judgment, the kind of tough-talking therapy he uses on his shows. In a particularly revealing and sensational address, delivered in a mix of Filipino and English, he spoke to Guo directly: “Alam naman talaga namin kung sino ka, kaya lang (We already know who you are, but) it’s very hard for us right now to find out, that’s why we’re trying to get more information about who you really are, because we know, and everybody knows…and you know in your heart, na inconsistent ka (that you’re inconsistent) and you’re lying.” We have already judged you, even though we are still gathering the facts: That, plus entertainment value, sums up much of the current public discourse about the issue today. What should we, as a country, do about Mayor Alice Guo? Follow the often-flawed processes of accountability. (The Senate is not a court.) Follow the money. (Estrada made a really sensible suggestion, to invite Guo’s father to the Senate investigation. Perhaps he understands the role of a patriarch in a family with many interests.) Follow the law. The one thing we should stop following are our worst instincts. To tweak the famous quote from the other Pogo (the good one, the comic strip character): “We have met the enemy, and he is also us.”",0
2,John Nery,"Confusing one with the other allows disinformation peddlers like SMNI to claim rights they don’t possess. Here’s an anecdote from the 1990s. A friend’s brother was waiting for a ride outside a convenience store in a gasoline station when a pair of men pulled a knife on him. Suddenly, a female journalist rushed out of the store, brandished her press ID, and ran toward the group, shouting, “Media ‘to! Media ‘to” (I’m media)! The startled men scattered, leaving the brother unharmed. Much about this story seems incredible, even apocryphal. The woman rushing out to break up a crime in progress is only the most outstanding detail. But the fearless or even reckless use of press identification as a kind of shield hits different now, a decade and a half after the Ampatuan massacre and mere years after the Duterte presidency demonized the press wholesale. Recalling the story now, I am struck by how dated – that is to say how characteristic of a particular time – the encounter was. It couldn’t have happened during the martial law era; I doubt if it can happen these days. It strikes me now as a relic from the last 15 years of the 20th century and the first 10 of the 21st, a high point for what we now call legacy media. But in my retelling of this encounter, I used key terms interchangeably. I identified a journalist, I mentioned a press card, I recalled what the friend’s brother heard his rescuer shout about being a member of the media. In ordinary conversation, in polite banter, in informal settings, we interchange “journalism,” “press,” and “media” all the time. By and large, we mean the same thing, though we use different words. We understand; we are understood. But the journalism professor and media critic Jay Rosen, whom I have been following for almost three decades now (first on the internet and then on social media), makes a helpful distinction between the three terms. 
On February 22, 2021, in the depths of the pandemic, Rosen posted a 26-tweet thread that drew important distinctions (and that was itself a demonstration of the importance of making distinctions). One of the tweets read: Media, journalism, and the press are not interchangeable terms. Yet they are bound up with one another. Media is the attention industry Journalism is a social practice The press is a key institution in a democracy Journalists who work in the media carry forward ‘the press’. Rosen had previously made a distinction between audience (“people attending to a common object, typically a performance or spectacle”) and public (“people with different interests who live in the same space and share common problems”). He wrote: “An audience is not a public.” He also wrote: “I think of the media as an attention business, an industry whose product is audiences.” Set of practices. By media, then, he means the system or the business that underlies journalism (as well as other forms of audience-seeking content). By journalism, he means the current set of practices that journalists follow, to do their work. And by the press as institution, he means (and this is my understanding of the idea) a democratic office – that is, a public position of some authority and service. This was not the first time Rosen drew the distinctions. For instance, in a wide-ranging conversation in April 2012 with Ethan Zuckerberg, then with the Center for Civic Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he spoke of this “tripartite” nature in depth. (See Jay Rosen’s Three-Layer Journalism Cake, or watch the forum on the MIT website.) Starting with an ode to the political thinker Hannah Arendt, who was a master at making distinctions, Rosen prefaced his remarks by attempting to “pull apart” the three terms. “The practice of journalism, that’s one thing…the practice is what people do when they’re doing journalism.” “The second thing I want to talk about…is the underlying media system that the practice runs on.” By media, he said, he meant “the way that we produce information, distribute it, connect people to it, in society as a whole. That’s different than the practice of journalism.” Then he said: “The third thing that we should be able to pull apart is the institution of the press…. The press as an institution, first of all, is different from country to country. The reason it’s different from country to country is it’s very powerfully a product of law. If you don’t have laws establishing freedom of the press, you don’t have any press. You might have journalism, you might have a media system, but you don’t have a press because everything that happens is just a pale reflection of power. So until you have a public sphere, until you have a free press, until you have a legal system that secures the right of a free press, you can’t have a press.” Threefold distinctions. I have found these distinctions to be decidedly useful. I had a chance to address a small group of United Nations regional officials in Bangkok in 2023 together with other guests, and I used my time to explain these threefold distinctions, and to argue that they can be used to align or prioritize UN work or assistance in freedom-of-expression and access-to-information issues.
Do reporters or photographers have the right to organize themselves as a labor union? While this question has freedom-of-the-press implications, it is (I submit) eminently a media issue – that is, it relates to the business or system side, as do questions about reasonable wages or working hours. Should all journalists, including editors and producers, follow company policies regulating social media use? While this question has media-as-business implications, it is (I suggest) primarily a journalism issue – that is, it relates to the set of practices that journalists follow as they do their work.
Can a reporter be required by an executive agency to reveal the source of particularly damning allegations? While this question has journalism-as-a-practice implications, it is (I wager) firstly a free press issue. Journalists must be able to guarantee their anonymous sources, especially those fearing retaliation or even violence for the mere act of speaking out, that their identities will be protected. (Unlike, say, in the United States, the Philippines since 1946 has had the benefit of the Sotto Law protecting the duty of journalists to not reveal their sources.) In the case of SMNI, or Sonshine Media Network International, the broadcast network owned by Apollo Quiboloy’s religious group, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ or KOJC, the airing of an erroneous report or commentary about Speaker Martin Romualdez is not and should not be cause enough to suspend its operations temporarily or to revoke its congressional franchise permanently. That is to give too much consideration, and power, to one man. The wisdom of that venerable libel ruling from the Supreme Court, now over a hundred years old, remains true: “Men in public life may suffer under a hostile and an unjust accusation; the wound can be assuaged with the balm of a clear conscience.”
Suspending SMNI for running a false report on Romualdez is abuse of power – but against what? Against SMNI as a media entity, a business organized to meet the communication objectives of KOJC. A one-strike-and-you’re-out policy is prejudicial to the officers and staff of a company that, because of the nature of the business it is in, is vulnerable to mistakes. If this unfair standard protecting prickly politicians were applied to all media companies, none would be left standing. An anchor or commentator making a terrible error on air is a media issue, because the inevitable occasional error is a matter for the company’s Human Resources department. Policies are or should be in place to enjoin officers and staff not to broadcast an unverified story, to correct an erroneous claim, to sanction those who err, to prevent a recurrence. Pattern of lies. But what about repeated errors or, in the case of hosts Lorraine Badoy Partosa and Jefffey Celiz, a long-term pattern of outright lies and dangerous red-tagging? That situation may be covered by an HR policy too, but at its core it is a journalism issue. It is about the standards of care and responsibility that hosts of a news and commentary program should meet in doing their work. In other words, their record shows that Badoy-Partosa and Celiz have been doing the opposite of journalism: malicious propaganda. Under Section 4 of the law renewing the SMNI franchise (through its parent company), the willful and repeated airing of disinformation is an outright violation of SMNI’s contract with the public: “not use its stations or facilities…for the dissemination of deliberately false information or willful misrepresentation, to the detriment of the public interest.” The case filed by the Movement Against Disinformation with the National Telecommunications Commission against SMNI is based precisely on this reading. But isn’t the attempt to recall SMNI’s franchise an attack on the free press? What’s the difference between SMNI and ABS-CBN, whose franchise Congress refused to renew under pressure from Rodrigo Duterte? The difference is the purpose for which the networks are used and, because form follows function, the way the networks are organized. For all its shortcomings, ABS-CBN sought and continues to seek to serve the public (not its audiences alone) by reporting the whole picture. Despite its self-described status as a “nation-builder,” SMNI serves the needs of KOJC and its “Appointed Son of God.” Does this mean that no religious station can qualify as the press? Not at all. As Rosen argued: “Journalists who work in the media carry forward ‘the press.’” It is the work that serves the public (distinct from the audience). What separates SMNI (and also NET25 at particular junctures in history) from other religious stations is that it willingly serves as a platform for propaganda and disinformation. It does not serve as an office, an institution, of democracy.

3,John Nery,"The complicated but lasting legacy of Benedict XVI. Benedict XVI was a pope of paradoxes: the progressive peritus in Vatican II turned conservative gatekeeper of Council teaching, the extraordinarily gifted theologian who limited debate and silenced Catholic academics, above all the guardian of reform whose startling resignation reformed the Roman Catholic Church in the most fundamental way. His death at the age of 95 was truly the end of an era: He is the last of the popes (after John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II) directly involved in the Second Vatican Council, which convened from 1962 to 1965. Pope Francis, who was still a Jesuit scholastic at the time, was ordained a priest only in 1969. It is also possible that, if the pope who succeeds Pope Francis comes from the Global South again, Benedict may be the last European to serve as pope for some time to come. It is almost certain that the age of European dominance in the Church ended with Benedict’s death. Or to be more precise, the dominance of the thinking that understands the Church as a European institution, highlighted by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger’s second reason for choosing Benedict as his papal name—to honor the great St. Benedict, he said, who “evokes the Christian roots of Europe.” But another generation to which Benedict belongs, that of the men and women who were scandalized by the worldwide youth protests of 1968 and channeled their shock and concern into conservative movements in culture and politics and religion, remains influential. Old habits. In the immediate aftermath of his death, heightened emotions and old habits led to some exaggerated claims. Jean-Pierre Denis, publisher of the international editions of the La Croix newspaper, began his thoughtful appreciation of Benedict’s considerable intellectual legacy by describing him as “the last great European intellectual of the 20th century” – a remarkable claim, considering that other influential thinkers who made their mark in the last century, including one with whom Benedict engaged in an important dialogue, Jurgen Habermas, remain very much alive. It is also remarkable that a scholar of the highest quality served as pope; perhaps this is all that Denis meant, that Benedict was a theologian of great influence and consequence, who earned the esteem of other scholars even outside the discipline of theology. Michael Sean Winters, writing insightfully for the National Catholic Reporter, described Benedict’s decision to resign as “a great act of demystification” of the papal office (objectively true) but also as “an implicit, unspoken rebuke” to Pope, now Saint, John Paul II and his decision to remain in office “despite the incapacities of old age” (an interpretation, not a fact, which discounts Benedict’s own well-considered reason). It is possible to learn from the example of others without the learning necessarily being an act of criticism, much less a rebuke. It is true that Benedict did not want to wither in office as John Paul II did. As he himself said, in his Latin message announcing his resignation: “I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to advanced age, are no longer suitable for the proper exercise of the Petrine ministry.” But that was his own charism, or special gift: The humility to step aside. His predecessor’s was altogether different: The gift to suffer in public. As Benedict said in his homily at John Paul II’s funeral mass: “he increasingly entered into the communion of Christ’s sufferings … And in this very communion with the suffering Lord, tirelessly and with renewed intensity, he proclaimed the gospel, the mystery of that love which goes to the end.” Describing the resignation as a rebuke is an old habit of journalism, storifying conflict even when none exists. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, in a piece that characteristically offered an alternative history of the modern Church, rued that Benedict had “conducted a postpapacy of ambiguous gestures in response to a Vatican that had been delivered, by the mysteries of God’s providence, to his longtime foes.” This is an old habit of partisans and ideologues, framing reality as a constant struggle. But Douthat makes it sound as though Benedict’s retirement (at almost 10 years, longer than his papacy) was spent conducting these ambiguous gestures, instead of the almost uninterrupted life of prayer, contemplation – and unequivocal support for Pope Francis – that it mainly was. New media. As a journalist and a Catholic, I have always been fascinated by Benedict’s understanding of the way the media works. I understand that other people helped in the drafting of, say, his messages for World Communications Day, but comparing his messages with those of Pope Francis, to give an example, immediately shows that their thinking, their personalities, are reflected in the words they choose to release under their own name. Many of Benedict’s WCD messages centered on what he called the “digital continent,” the new “agora” created by digital technology. In 2009, he touched on an essential feature of social media networks like Facebook. “The concept of friendship has enjoyed a renewed prominence in the vocabulary of the new digital social networks that have emerged in the last few years … We should be careful … never to trivialize the concept or the experience of friendship.” In 2011, he noted that the new digital technologies “allow people to meet each other beyond the confines of space and of their own culture,” and then asked: “Who is my ‘neighbor’ in this new world?” In 2013, in his last message, he warned us: “Believers are increasingly aware that, unless the Good News is made known also in the digital world, it may be absent in the experience of many people for whom this existential space is important.” These insights deepen my disappointment at his alternative history of Vatican II, because it is confoundingly media-centric. In 2013, addressing Roman clergy, Benedict asserted that “there was the Council of the Fathers – the real Council – but there was also the Council of the media. It was almost a Council apart, and the world perceived the Council through the latter, through the media.” He added: “For the media, the Council was a political struggle, a power struggle between different trends int he Church.” But in fact, the Council was also a power struggle. As insider accounts prove, there was a “fierce battle” (Time’s Robert Blair Kaiser), a duel between the majority of the bishops and the reactionary Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani and his allies (peddling “papalist nonsense,” the peritus Yves Congar wrote in his diary). Sometimes, conflict does exist, and journalists do right to report on it. True legacy. Where does this paradoxical pope’s true legacy lie? While he has been criticized for his own handling of clerical sexual abuse cases when he was Archbishop of Munich, and continues to be criticized for his predecessor’s inaction, he acted decisively when he was head of the Congregation for Doctrine of the Faith. Thomas Reese, the Jesuit editor who was forced to resign from America magazine because of Benedict, wrote: “When his congregation was assigned abuse cases, the disciplinarian tendencies that led him to police theologians allowed him to cut through canonical niceties to expel hundreds, perhaps thousands, of abusers from the priesthood. His response was never perfect, but he did understand and deal with the problem quicker than any other Vatican official, including John Paul.” When he was pope, he removed an abusive religious founder from the ministry, and met with victims of abuse. His writings will continue to inspire many. His Introduction to Christianity, first published in 1968, remains a model of clarity; his many books, his three encyclicals, his Jesus trilogy (written when he was already pope), will continue to draw new readers (and old ones ready for rereading). He had the teacher’s gift for explaining even the most complicated of subjects. It should come as no surprise that he was the man in charge of John Paul’s project to publish the Catechism of the Catholic Church. “The fact that after an era of very strong theological and ecclesial debates and tensions, within a few years, that is, already by 1992, the work came to fruition in a largely convincing way has something miraculous about it,” wrote his former spokesman, Federico Lombardi SJ. Finally, his assertion of what he called the “hermeneutic of continuity and reform” will for a long time be heard differently, by those who prefer continuity and by those who seek reform of and in the Church, but his decision to resign the papacy, the first such instance in 600 years, could only have been possible because he followed that hermeneutic to the very end. He believed in both; he could resign because the Church allows reform, and he could resign in full confidence because the Church guarantees continuity. Truly a pope of paradoxes.",0
4,John Nery,"Now that she has passed the point of no return, which options will the Vice President choose? The one from 2001, or the one from 1957? The future of the Duterte political brand rests on the 2028 vote, and the run-up to it. Davao City itself remains the family stronghold. The former president’s second son Baste Duterte easily won election as mayor in 2022, his vote total more than eight times that of his closest challenger. Rep. Pulong Duterte, who cruised to victory with 15 times more votes than the next candidate, is poised to win a third term in 2025. And Vice President Sara Duterte herself won the vice-presidential contest in the city with 10% more votes than the mayor-elect; her vote total was 55 times that of the vice presidential candidate with the second highest number of votes. (Interestingly, the “people’s justice” constituency of Sen. Raffy Tulfo in Davao City was not enough to place him in the first 12 Senate slots; he came in 13th.) So mark the city safe for the Dutertes. But the rest of the country? Much will depend on what happens in the next few years: if the doomsday cult leader Apollo Quiboloy is extradited to the United States, if the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant against former president Rodrigo Duterte, if an armed encounter in the West Philippine Sea hardens Philippine public opinion against China, if the scandals involving Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators and scammy Pharmally come home to roost in Davao. It is in the best interest of the Duterte family and their allies, then, to ensure that VP Sara becomes the next president. That is how I understand her resignation from the Cabinet, and from the influential position of education secretary. (The Department of Education is the country’s largest bureaucracy.) She means to do all she can to prepare herself to succeed Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Four types of succession. But consider the vice presidents who succeeded to the presidency. History tells us there are at least four types of succession. The first path is the one contemplated by our constitutions: The president dies in office. Three found themselves traveling down this path: Sergio Osmeña succeeded Manuel Quezon in 1944, Elpidio Quirino succeeded Manuel Roxas in 1948, Carlos Garcia succeeded Ramon Magsaysay in 1957. The second trail is that blazed by Diosdado Macapagal, the first vice president elected from another party that was different from the president’s. Several months after the plane crash that claimed Magsaysay’s life, Garcia of the Nationalistas was elected president in his own right, in November 1957; for the first time, however, a president’s election mandate fell below a majority. Macapagal, because he was a Liberal, was shut out of the Cabinet. He spent the next four years essentially campaigning throughout the country, and handily beat Garcia for the presidency in 1961. The third path is the one that Joseph Estrada defined. While he belonged to a party different from that of Fidel Ramos, he accepted Ramos’ offer to include him in government through a presidential task force tailored to Estrada’s public persona as a tough-talking crimebuster. While he was not politically aligned with Ramos, he remained a popular part of the president’s official family until the end of their term. The fourth is that which unmade Estrada, and made Gloria Arroyo. A People-Powered uprising and the withdrawal of support from the military leadership forced Estrada out of office and installed Arroyo as president in 2001. Which path will VP Sara choose? Based on a reading of the many comments from Duterte supporters on social media, it seems that a good number would favor what I would call the Arroyo option. I do not mean to suggest that Gloria Arroyo, then the vice president, worked actively behind the scenes in early 2001 to undermine President Estrada; I only mean to say that the idea, held by quite a number of supporters of both the former president and his daughter, that Marcos Jr. can be forced to resign and that Sara Duterte can then replace him, is not fiction but rather fantasy fed on the events of 2001. That’s the underlying scenario behind former speaker Pantaleon Alvarez’s seditious appeal to the military to withdraw its support from President Marcos Jr. It’s a scenario nourished on regret and resentment, based on the (correct) assumption that he would not have been elected if he had not teamed up with Duterte. You can sense this skewed theme of false nostalgia run through the comments like an electric current: “She should have been president all along.” But can the Vice President and her allies engineer the ouster of another Marcos? This seems unlikely, if only because the Vice President’s father showed exactly how powerful the presidency is, despite the additional safeguards built into the 1987 Constitution. If he can brazen it out (the Rodrigo Duterte legacy), a president can outlast any rival. In other words, the moral standards or the public virtues we naturally expect of any president are not hard-wired into the system; a president acting exactly like Rodrigo Duterte can throw all that aside, and he will get away with it. Force the Supreme Court to impeach a chief justice without the benefit of impeachment, detain an incumbent senator for almost her entire term on trumped-up charges, impose martial law in Mindanao without meeting constitutional requirements, threaten opponents with mythical narco-lists and lethal red tags, demonize journalists, and so on, ad nauseam. Does Marcos Jr. have the appetite for such a political war of attrition? That remains to be seen, but it is important to remember the lesson we learned from Duterte: The presidency has the capacity to wage that kind of war. Going Macapagal. A more realistic reading of the situation suggests that VP Sara will likely follow the example of Cong Dadong, the “poor boy from Lubao,” who is not coincidentally the father of her close political ally, former president and former speaker Gloria Arroyo. Sara resigned to campaign full time for the presidency. She is now unburdened of the responsibilities of education secretary, for which she was never really qualified in the first place. The same day she resigned, the other main news story about Philippine education was yet more confirmation of its dismal state: In the 2022 cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA, the Philippines ranked in the bottom four in the world in “creative thinking.” This is the sort of news that will haunt any education secretary thinking of a presidential run; by the time VP Sara runs for the presidency in 2028, she would have distanced herself enough from such depressing statistics. (And if the work of the Second Congressional Commission on Education actually bears fruit by then, she can point to her participation, non-consequential but real, in the commission’s initial stages.) She is now free from the need to defend any policy of the Marcos Jr. administration, or at least to keep silent, and free to criticize it on the issues that matter most to the Dutertes and their allies: engagement with the ICC, defense of the West Philippine Sea, peace talks with the communist insurgency. She is now at liberty to test the one message of her father’s that never resonated with the public, the one theme he couldn’t sell: that our future lies in a closer alliance with Beijing. Coming out this early, and this unequivocally, carries a serious risk. If a somewhat cloying reticence propelled her to the top of the pre-election surveys before allying with Marcos Jr., how will undisguised ambition affect her standings? That calls for all kinds of creative thinking.",0
5,John Nery,"The communist insurgency is at its weakest. Counter-intuitively, now is the best time for both sides to resume peace talks and reach a peace deal. A new report by the International Crisis Group published in April concludes that the “Maoist insurgency in the Philippines is at its lowest ebb in decades.” From a high of 25,000 armed regulars in the last years of the Marcos regime, the number of rebels is down to somewhere between 1,200 and 2000 – roughly speaking, close to the same number when the first President Marcos used the then-new insurgency as a pretext for imposing martial rule in 1972. The insurgency is hampered by serious organizational challenges, including “perhaps the most severe leadership crisis in its history” (provoked not only by the death of its founder but also by “the killing [by the Philippine military] of several high-ranking commanders over the last three years”); a reduction in revenues generated from so-called revolutionary taxation (because of the loss of territory and “the arrest of financial operatives”); and internal confusion (“differences among cadres regarding the movement’s political and military direction”). These and other crises can be seen reflected, even without the benefit of context, in the message the Communist Party of the Philippines published to mark its 55th anniversary. Without reference to the combination of military pressure and development outreach that the government has been leveling against the insurgency, the message may read as yet another (though still remarkably candid) exercise in the revolutionary discipline of “criticism and self-criticism.” But read in the context of the rebellion’s continuing loss of leaders, fighters, base areas, resources, and informal support structures, these passages from the December 26, 2023, message confirm that the movement is, in fact, in bad shape. The message recognized that “not a few guerrilla fronts of the [New Peoples Army] stagnated and got stuck for a long time at the old level.” The cause, however, was identified as “some Party leaders,” who “self-constricted the NPA to its reliable guerrilla base areas and mountain encampments, limiting the scope or range of military and political initiative of the Party and NPA. Self-constriction goes against the need for guerrilla units to constantly move forward and advance, and to be always on offensive footing. Reliable guerrilla base areas were eventually reduced to a few ‘favorite’ or ‘comfort zone’ barrios, communities or mountain encampments with easy access to mass support, supply lines or communication facilities.” Military conservatism. The message developed its argument with even more candor: “Self-constriction and loss of initiative leads to military conservatism, as points from which the NPA can hit the enemy became limited or inaccessible. Other concomitant problems that arise include gathering intelligence, sources of supply, communications, and so on. The NPA could not readily carry out an ambush at the highway because its main forces are encamped in the interior areas. Mounting raids, ambushes, and other basic tactical offensives became increasingly cumbersome and time-consuming. They became content with attrition tactical offensives (harassment, sanctions and so on) and lost sight of the need to mount sustained annihilation or basic tactical offensives as the principal component of our strategy to weaken the enemy part by part and steadily strengthen the people’s army. “In a significant number of guerrilla fronts which had company-sized or multiple-platoon-sized forces, some Party leaders became complacent and self-assured. There were cases of over concentration of forces in some regions or sub-regions, where two or more guerrilla companies are brought together in a mountain encampment over extended periods of several months, to conduct trainings, education courses, prolonged meetings or to await execution of an ill-planned offensive, leaving less [sic] forces and less time for mass work. These prolonged encampments caused a heavy strain on the organized masses and militia forces who have to work hard to keep the supply lines running. These also cause guerrilla discipline to slacken and ‘civilianize’ guerrilla forces. Some NPA units have encountered problems of drinking among guerrilla fighters.” And so on, in this vein. The Crisis Group report characterized the CPP as “mindful of these challenges,” and summarized the message of December 2023 (and that of March 2024 too) as a call to “galvanize the movement” and “reinvigorate political and logical education for cadres and combatants.” Peace talks. Does it make strategic sense for the Philippine government to restart peace talks with the CPP-NPA and its National Democratic Front? The joint announcement last November of an agreement to resume peace negotiations was a real surprise – and was met with a mix of skepticism and hope. The skeptical response raised suspicions about political maneuvering ahead of the 2025 midterm elections; when Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ran again for the Senate in 2010, he was on the same slate as Bayan Muna’s Satur Ocampo and Gabriela’s Liza Masa. The hopeful stance recognized that one of the administration’s signatories of the Joint Statement for Peace was Special Adviser to the President Anton Lagdameo, President Marcos’ closest friend. But if the insurgency is at its weakest, why even attempt to strike a peace deal? Shouldn’t the government continue its current campaign mixing military pressure and development outreach until the last base area is recovered, the last guerrilla front overrun? It has already been about a decade since the national security establishment under the second Aquino administration came to the conclusion that the communist insurgency was no longer the country’s main national-security threat. The pivot to external defense or territorial defense operations (TDO) under the second Marcos administration formalizes the downgrading of the insurgency. Peace negotiations will help ease the pivot to external defense. That is the first reason why the Marcos administration should return to the negotiating table. The second reason is the law of diminishing returns; the counter-insurgency campaign that has helped reduce the size of the NPA by about half, since Rodrigo Duterte came to power, may have already reached its optimal phase. Besides, the kind of justification often offered by those who would like the current campaign to continue is very much along the lines of “crushing” the rebellion. The rebels are on the run, why stop hot pursuit? Because history’s lesson is clear. According to “Paths to Victory,” the 2013 RAND Corporation study of 71 insurgencies (updated from its influential 2010 study of 30 insurgencies, titled “Victory Has a Thousand Fathers”), the so-called “iron fist” path succeeds “only 32 percent of the time,” while its opposite approach, the so-called motive-focused path, succeeds 73 percent of the time. The iron fist approach to counterinsurgency (COIN) focuses primarily on “eliminating the insurgent threat,” while the motive path addresses “the motives for beginning and sustaining the insurgency.” In other words, the iron fist seeks to hammer the insurgents to oblivion, while the motive-focused approach resolves the conditions that gave rise to and supplies the insurgency. And the lesson from the history of insurgency from 1944 to 2010 is that the COIN odds do not favor the use of force alone. To quote the 2013 study: “The importance of reducing insurgents’ tangible support is the center-most finding of this research. Successful COIN forces reduce not only the active insurgents but also the support that fuels the insurgency.” But the Philippine Army, by far the largest of the services, has more invested in continuing the counterinsurgency campaign than any other institution; it is, hyperbolically, the only thing they know. They (and the Duterte political alliance) may stand in the way. Weaker position. Does it make strategic sense for the communist insurgency to enter into peace talks? As the scattered leadership must be only too aware, they will be returning to the negotiating table with a much weaker position. But they do own a conspicuous advantage: They offer the second President Marcos the historic opportunity of ending the insurgency that started under the first President Marcos. If the Marcos family were serious about rehabilitating their family name, concluding real peace with the communist rebels would rank high among the pathways to rehabilitation – not as high as paying their billion-peso tax arrears or returning their ill-gotten wealth, but high enough to cement their new reputation in Western capitals. But peace talks may also result in the suspension of red-tagging and red-baiting by government and military officials (the provocative actions of Duterte supporters is a different problem altogether), and may create the momentum necessary to review and improve the work of the task force overseeing the government’s COIN campaign. Not the abolition that UN Special Rapporteur Irene Kahn had strongly recommended (that looks outside the realm of political probability), but at least a change that renders it more community-oriented, more representative, more civilian. (The Crisis Group makes the same recommendations.) Time to talk peace again.",0
6,John Nery,"A Catholic priest once walked out on me, while I was in mid-speech. In 2018, it was my privilege to serve as the keynote speaker at the Cardinal Sin Catholic Book Awards, held during the annual Manila International Book Fair. I was tasked to speak on “fake news” and journalism for peace — the same themes Pope Francis addressed in his message for World Communications Day that year. Using the Pope’s own provocative description of the act of disinformation, I focused my remarks on how to fight “the logic of the snake.”

In passing, I noted that many journalists and academics no longer find “fake news” a useful category. “Some of my colleagues in journalism and many scholars in the academe prefer not to use the term anymore,” I said, though I still did, “because the idiot Donald Trump has hijacked the meaning of ‘fake news’ and now it can be used to mean anything, especially anything the user doesn’t like or approve of or believe in.” That was all I said about Trump that day.

But the following day, I got an email:

“Dear Mr Nery. I attended your talk last night at the Cardinal Sin awards. I am a priest and an american. Your reference to my president as an idiot rendered your talk on fake news as arrogant and shallow. Your bragging that you were married by Cardinal Sin, came across as a self serving compliment to your ego. I almost got up and confronted you… but did not want to disrupt the ceremony. I simply got up and left SMX. I was derply offended and want you to know that …”

I did not see the walkout; the sprawling SMX convention hall was busy in those pre-COVID-19 days, and the corner of the hall where the awards were presented was full. So this came as news to me. I could see that the sender was still agitated, many hours after my incidental remark had offended him. The typographical errors and the gratuitous insult testified to the haste by which the letter was written.

I had, in fact, spoken of Jaime Cardinal Sin’s role in my wedding; it was how I started my speech. “When Father […] asked me to speak in this year’s Cardinal Sin Catholic Book Awards, I said yes immediately, in part for personal reasons. Many years ago, Cardinal Sin officiated at my wedding; I thought that speaking at a ceremony and in a publishing tradition that was named after him, to pay tribute to his expansive vision of a truly Catholic media and communications culture, would be a chance to give back in return.”

That was all I said about that. It was a personal tribute to a man of God who had, through sheer happenstance (or providence), officiated at my wedding.

The day after the first email, I got a second one.

“Mr Nery my apologies for my nasty remark about your ego. It was way out of bounds for a catholic priest to put in an email. I put it there in a moment of deep anger.. Very sorry..”

Setting Trump aside for a moment, I would like to think that my “talk on fake news” was not, in fact, “arrogant and shallow,” because it relied in large part on a deep reading of the Pope’s own words. (I also used the example of a corrupt, compromised journalist from Rizal’s second novel to illustrate “the inner structure, the psychology, of disinformation.”)


In the English version of the Pope’s message, he used the term “snake-tactics” to refer to disinformation, saying it was “the strategy employed by the ‘crafty serpent’ in the Book of Genesis.” But I think the Spanish original is much better: “logica de la serpiente.” It is better than snake-tactics because it suggests “the deliberateness, the rationality, the sheer evil, at the center of ‘fake news’ and other forms of disinformation.”

But back to Trump. On reflection, I should not have described Trump as an idiot. Not because he isn’t; to those who are open to the abundant evidence, the idiocy of this self-described “stable genius” is an established fact.

I should have focused, instead, on Trump’s profound immorality as a public official. I should have criticized this American president according to the standards set by an illustrious, if difficult, predecessor. John Adams famously wrote: “Public Virtue cannot exist in a Nation without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics. There must be a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest, Honour, Power and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there can be no Republican Government, nor any real liberty.”

Without speaking of Trump’s apparent deficiency in what Adams would describe as private virtue (almost two dozen sexual harassment incidents, payoffs to porn stars, tax evasion, and so on ad nauseam), even non-Americans can see that he does not possess “a positive Passion for the public good, the public interest.” His lack of care, in a pandemic, for the staff who help him and the supporters who show up at his rallies; his repeated return to the golf links, which has cost the American public an astonishing $140 million; his brazen violation of laws and norms, including instructing the justice department to arrest his rival, the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and publicly calling on his appointees in the US Supreme Court to side with him in case of an election dispute—all these, and many more, are disqualifying. Where is the public Virtue in his actions, which is the only Foundation of Republics?

This argument, fundamentally, is an appeal to the American as citizen, to heed Benjamin Franklin’s clever quip and prescient warning: The United States is “a republic, if you can keep it.”",0
7,John Nery,"When losing vice presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr. filed an election protest in June 2016 with the Supreme Court, in its capacity as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), he offered three causes of action.

The first was sweeping, even shocking. He wanted the PET to declare as inauthentic all the certificates of canvass used by Congress to proclaim Leni Robredo vice president. The shock was not that he targeted Robredo, but that the logical consequence of his first cause of action would also undermine the election of his political ally, President Duterte.

The certificates of canvass that Marcos alleged were inauthentic were the same ones used to proclaim Mr. Duterte president. His first cause, then, was based on a sketchy legal theory which Supreme Court justices described, fairly, as “surgical annulment.” In a word, he did not question the authenticity of the President’s election, only that of the Vice President. But there was no reasonable way to surgically annul one result, but retain another, in the same certificate.

In September 2017, the PET dismissed the first cause of action as “an exercise in futility.”

The second cause of action called for the recount of votes in three provinces of Marcos’ own choosing. That bears repeating. The rules of election protest allow the losing candidate alleging election fraud to choose three pilot provinces that, in his view, would have the best chance of proving his allegation. Marcos chose Camarines Sur, Robredo’s home province; and two provinces in the Visayas which voted strongly for Robredo and her presidential candidate Mar Roxas, namely Iloilo and Negros Oriental.

After a tedious and lengthy process, the recount was completed in October 2019—or almost three and a half years after the election. Not only did Marcos fail to show a substantial recovery that would have precipitated a wider recount; Robredo even widened her lead over him.

“Thus,” the PET resolution read, “based on the final tally after revision and appreciation of the votes in the pilot provinces, protestee Robredo maintained, as in fact she increased, her lead with 14,436,337 votes over protestant Marcos who obtained 14,157,771 votes.” Robredo’s lead had grown from 263,473 to 278,566, or a gain of 15,093 votes.

By the tribunal’s own rules, Marcos’ failure to prove fraud in the three pilot provinces he had chosen should have resulted in the dismissal of his entire election protest. The first paragraph of Rule 65 reads:

“The Tribunal may require the protestant or counter-protestant to indicate, within a fixed period, the province or provinces numbering not more than three, best exemplifying the frauds or irregularities alleged in his petition; and the revision of ballots and reception of evidence will begin with such provinces. If upon examination of such ballots and proof and after making reasonable allowances, the Tribunal is convinced that, taking all circumstances into account, the protestant or counter-protestant will most probably fail to make out his case, the protest may forthwith be dismissed, without further consideration of the other provinces mentioned in the protest.”

But instead of dismissing the Marcos protest, the PET, voting 11-2, asked the parties to comment on the Tribunal’s dismissal of the second cause of action and to submit their memoranda on Marcos’ third cause—seeking the annulment of the elections in Lanao del Sur, Basilan, and Maguindanao.

To a layman, the language of Rule 65 may suggest possibility, not a directive. “The Tribunal may require” the revision of ballots in “not more than three” pilot provinces, and if failure to prove fraud or irregularity looks likely, “the protest may forthwith be dismissed.”

But the two justices who voted to dismiss the protest outright argued that in fact the mandate of Rule 65 was clear. Justice Benjamin Caguioa, the member in charge of the protest at the time, said the Marcos protest was marked by “a clear and unmistakable lack of basis.” And Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, in one of his last dissents, wrote: “The last thing that this Tribunal should do is to change its rules in midstream to accommodate a party who has failed to comply with what Rule 65 of the 2010 PET Rules expressly requires.”

A closer look at the language of Rule 65 raises that very question of accommodation. Having given Marcos the opportunity to prove election fraud in three provinces of his own choosing, the Tribunal ended up convinced, after all reasonable allowances were made and all circumstances taken into account, that Marcos had failed to make his case. In other words, the dismissal of the second cause met all the conditions listed in Rule 65. Why did the majority of justices fail to follow through on its clear conclusion? The entire protest should “forthwith be dismissed, without further consideration of the other provinces mentioned in the protest.”

Due process was the rationale given in October 2019. Last month, almost a year after the second cause was dismissed and the Tribunal moved to consider the third, it ordered the Commission on Elections and, for some reason, the Office of the Solicitor General, to comment on issues related to the third cause of action.

So this is where we are today. Marcos’ protest is now on its fourth year; it has lengthily processed, and lost, two causes of action; it even included an attempt to unseat Caguioa as member in charge. Let’s speak plainly. If someone has been denied the full amplitude of due process, it has not been Marcos but Robredo—the country’s duly elected Vice President.",0
8,John Nery,"We can be morally indignant at the power struggle in the House of Representatives, happening out in the open in the middle of a pandemic that the government has barely contained. We can be coldly analytical about the alignment of political blocs in Congress and the matrix of possible alliances and probable consequences. But those of us critical of the Duterte program of government should not let indignation color our analysis.Yes, the Cayetano and Velasco factions both belong to the administration supermajority. But even though we may feel like shouting, “A pox on both your houses,” we should not read the situation as “It’s all the same, no matter who wins.”

It matters that Alan Peter Cayetano has his hour of reckoning. He was responsible for the haphazard preparations for the 2019 Southeast Asian Games which stained the country’s reputation; even President Duterte had to apologize for the bad press the country received. “You cannot just cast away all those, the discomfort, the sufferings of the athletes… sleeping on the floors, waiting for so many hours, getting hungry,” the President said, the day before the Games opened. On top of all this, the Philippine SEA Games Organizing Committee (Phisgoc), the private organization Cayetano established to run the event, has remaining payables (which may have to be subsidized by the government). Many in the ruling coalition wanted him investigated back then, as an administration personality told me last December. And judging by his statements in the last few weeks, he knows that once he loses the speakership his own allies may investigate him. If he has nothing to hide, then good for him. But an investigation into the failures and possible anomalies of Phisgoc is overdue and still needed. (See my “Of course Cayetano is to blame,” 12/3/19.)

It also matters that Cayetano, mere months after he killed the franchise of the TV and radio network that turned his family into a political dynasty, will be forced to honor the very term-sharing agreement which made his election as speaker possible. He was, of course, only following the President’s expressed desire, but it was during his term that the unthinkable happened, and those who criticized him for his role in rejecting the new ABS-CBN franchise must see his ouster as karmic in nature. This is not to say that Lord Allan Velasco, his rival for speaker, would not have killed the ABS-CBN franchise if he had been in charge. He undoubtedly would have. But if the political opposition cannot see any difference between the two, then I worry about the opposition. It was Cayetano who put the budget at risk, when he suddenly adjourned the session more than a week ahead of schedule. As Marikina Rep. Stella Quimbo has pointed out, a reenacted budget would damage an already weakened economy and wreak havoc on the government’s coronavirus response. Adjournment without notice to avoid ouster is reason enough to be ousted.

Some critics of the government see the hand of the President’s daughter, Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte, behind Velasco. They would be right if what they mean is that the young Duterte was an influential backer. Politics IS addition. But they would be wrong if they think that the campaign to remove Cayetano from the speaker’s post was masterminded by the mayor, or designed to turn her into presidential timber. Many made the mistake before in ascribing former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s sudden election as speaker in 2018 to Inday Sara. (See my “How much power does Inday Sara have?” 5/28/19.) The young Duterte was an influential supporter of Arroyo’s, and her anger against Pantaleon Alvarez helped focus Congress’ attention on Speaker Alvarez’s turn from friendly cowboy to the sultan of the session hall.

As for her political plans, she remains one of the President’s exit strategies—a reluctant one, from all indications, and one who has thus far not yet generated the same kind of anticipation as her father did in 2015. But is installing Velasco part of a grand plan? It is true that Inday Sara cannot stand Cayetano, and has more than once dropped large hints on social media; it is also true that she and Velasco have much more in common. But it is paranoia to think that the mayor is masterminding Velasco’s ascent.

It is possible that her role will be spun again, turning her into the key that opened the chamber’s door for Velasco, but I think at this time politicians and their operators already know just how limited the reach of Inday Sara’s Hugpong is. Her role this time around is also different from during the Arroyo-Alvarez power struggle, of which her father had no inkling. Then, she was seen as anti-Alvarez; today she is seen as pro-Duterte. Her support for Velasco is understood as another proxy for the President’s imprimatur. The only politician whose presidential plans are definitely affected will be Cayetano.

Will a reinvigorated Velasco at the helm of the House, rather than a weakened Cayetano, mean the President’s odds of anointing a successor have gone up? Not necessarily. Murmurs promising reconciliation are being heard, but the factions in the House that competed for the speakership in 2019 are still there, each one nursing wounds, each one keeping score.",0
9,John Nery,"Some of the questions raised in last week’s historical revisionism conference — in different variations and at different times — may be classified as questions about “the other side.” What was Ferdinand Marcos like (to quote a young nursing student), “minus the greediness, and minus the cruelty”? How should we treat those of our grandparents’ generation, who lived in the Marcos era and remember it positively? “Was martial law really bad because it abused human rights or it was just the people who were at fault because they lack discipline?” another participant asked. What, in other words, were the good things that Ferdinand Marcos did in office?

Much of the BalikKaSaysayAn conference, hosted by the Asian Center for Journalism at the Ateneo de Manila and the Consortium on Democracy and Disinformation, was spent on confirming and countering the historical denialism project of the Marcos family and its allies. The 10 sessions over five days had a total running time of almost 16 hours, all of it recorded. And the conference drew considerable interest, with the help of Tanggol Kasaysayan, Bulatlat, and the Guidon: over 3,400 registrations, over 2,200 in actual attendance, over 1,300 staying for the entirety of the sessions they registered for.

But the questions about the side of Marcos were raised at almost all the sessions. I do not necessarily think that they are representative of today’s generation of students; perhaps it would be more accurate to say (based on my experience speaking in different parts of the country) that they represent a regional attitude. This is not to slight the questions or their importance; this generation, from all regions, is particularly vulnerable to the Marcos rehabilitation project on Facebook and YouTube. But I do want to add the context I see.

What good did Marcos do? To me, that question is akin to asking: What good did the Japanese Imperial Army do, when it invaded and occupied the Philippines during World War II?

It is a category error to treat the Marcos years like any other presidential term. He disrupted history itself, set himself apart from other presidents by planning a military takeover of government and installing himself as dictator. It is a fine irony that the man who acted as though he were larger than history must now find refuge and rehabilitation in a revised, reduced version of it.

His own presidential diaries provide the evidence: Marcos began planning a complete takeover of the government after his reelection in December 1969. He could no longer run for a third term, and he had convinced himself that he must stay in power. Before the communist insurgency became a significant threat, before “discipline” became a buzzword and then a convenient excuse, before he waged war on “oligarchs” on behalf of his cronies, he was already planning to kill Philippine democracy. Is the question to ask, What good did this murderer do? Or should we ask: Why did he murder democracy, and how did he get away with it?

Even the court victory the Marcoses may be proudest of, the acquittal of Imelda Marcos on racketeering and fraud charges in New York in 1990, which effectively led to the end of the family’s exile, confirmed the dictator’s outsized corruption. Essentially, Imelda was acquitted because while the trial established that Marcos himself was corrupt, the jurors did not connect the corruption to Imelda.

The New York Times’ report the day after: “For Mrs. Marcos, who has been parodied and reviled for her ostentatious life style, the trial confirmed her reputation as a ‘world-class shopper,’ in the words of her own defense team. But clearly the jurors never grasped why the case had been brought to an American courtroom and certainly they did not see her as a thief. The crimes may have been committed by Mr. Marcos, many of them said, but through five days of deliberation, they did not believe that any of the evidence struck at Mrs. Marcos.”

It’s possible Imelda’s dramatic appearances in the courtroom during the three-month-long trial—copious crying, the occasional health emergency, the uniform use of the widow’s mourning clothes—led the jurors to think she was incapable of hurting a fly, much less conspiring to commit graft and fraud. She had performed as her counsel Gerry Spence had described her: “a small, fragile widow.” (He, and they, did not know, or care, that in the Philippines she had been known as “the iron butterfly.”)

But the trial established, through Imelda’s own lawyers’ arguments, that “Mrs. Marcos’s lavish buying was part of the culture, including her infamous collection of thousands of pairs of shoes. Her lawyers even explained the testimony about kickbacks and ‘commissions’ that went to President Marcos as a natural component of the Philippine system.” As the Times noted, the thousands of pages of evidence included “bank checks and private letters and cryptic notebooks filled with scribbled dollar ledgers. Their very appearance suggested a shadowy Government run by scheming leaders.” And this from a court case that the Marcoses won!

If Marcos had not fallen ill, he would not have been “severed from the indictment,” as a court document phrased it. By dying, he escaped a guilty verdict, but his death was yet another gift for Imelda, too. Is the question to ask: What good did this most corrupt man do? Or should we ask instead: Who helped him steal all our money, and where’s the rest of it?",0
10,John Nery,"The Marcos dictatorship was built on a structure of falsehoods. Even the date that Ferdinand Marcos chose to remember the start of martial rule, and thus of his so-called New Society, was fake. It was picked for numerology’s purposes: 21 was a multiple of 7, his favorite number. But in fact the “autogolpe” or self-coup that Marcos had been planning for years was finally imposed on Sept. 23, 1972.

That’s the real anniversary of martial law in the Philippines, as Manolo Quezon has not tired of reminding us. Marcos chose to fix the date of Proclamation 1081, which declared a state of martial law in the country, as Thursday, Sept. 21. The following year, he began to elevate the status of this fake anniversary by recognizing it as a special holiday, to be known as National Thanksgiving Day.

Proclamation 1180, signed on Aug. 30, 1973, began with that unctuous note that had begun to sound throughout martial law officialdom: “WHEREAS, the Association of Barrio Captains has urged the proclamation of September 21st as the National Thanksgiving Day in a formal resolution presented to the President of the Philippines and the First Lady, Mrs. Imelda Romualdez Marcos.”

Right.

But on Sept 21, 1972, the Philippines was still nominally democratic. Quezon’s martial law timeline, an excellent resource, tells us that on that day, a large protest, reported to be 30,000 strong, thronged Plaza Miranda.

On that day, Sen. Ninoy Aquino, the lone opposition senatorial candidate to survive the Marcos mid-term juggernaut in 1967, who had risen in the next five years from youngest-ever member of the Senate to the President’s political arch-rival, delivered a privilege speech—the last of his life, and of the pre-martial law Senate.

And on that day, Aquino converses with Sen. Arturo Tolentino, a maverick politician who, in the 1986 snap election, served as Marcos’ running mate. Aquino tells him he plans to disappear, because Marcos was coming for him.

On Sept. 22, the plans begin to take form. Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile’s car is stage-ambushed, to provide Marcos with a pretext for the declaration. Troops are deployed at night. Documents are couriered. Imelda holds court at the Philippine Village Hotel for a press dinner, a maneuver that Agence France Presse bureau chief Teddy Benigno saw as a diversion. And close to midnight, Aquino receives warnings by phone while at what was then the Manila Hilton. After midnight, the first arrests, including that of Aquino, are made.

Primitivo Mijares, the self-described “cynical newspaperman” who became Marcos’ “media czar” and was present at the creation of the New Society, before turning on Marcos in 1975, testified before the US Congress that:

“President Marcos announced formally at about 8 p.m. on Sept. 23, 1972, that he had placed the entire Philippines under martial law as of 9 p.m. Sept. 22, 1972, by way of effective implementation of a martial law edict (Proclamation No. 1081) which he had signed on Sept. 21, 1972. Two months later, he told a convention of historians that he really signed the proclamation on Sept. 17, 1972.”

(In the same testimony, Mijares noted that he was “an unwitting tool” for Marcos. “As a matter of fact, I was the first newspaperman to write the full story of the imposition of martial law 12 hours before its official announcement. I have access in advance to the original copies of the martial law proclamation and the first six General Orders issued by President Marcos.”)

If martial law officially began on Sept. 23, why did Marcos choose to signify another date? Something the incomparable Hannah Arendt wrote about two decades before Marcos imposed military rule in the Philippines tells us that the answer must be: Because he could. “Before mass leaders seize the power to fit reality to their lies, their propaganda is marked by its extreme contempt for facts as such, for in their opinion fact depends entirely on the power of man who can fabricate it.”

Marcos had already constructed a fake persona: a bemedalled hero of World War II. In fact, as the New York Times reported in 1986, “repeated Army investigations found no foundation for Mr. Marcos’s claims that he led a guerrilla force called Ang Mga Maharlika in military operations against Japanese forces from 1942 to 1944.” This was a central part of Marcos’ political appeal.

Marcos had also constructed a fake legal record: the highest grade in the Philippine Bar. (A stupid thing, really, but of great political value in a status-conscious electorate. In fact, the record — 96.7 percent — was achieved by Florenz Regalado in 1954, almost two whole decades before the Marcos personality cult was launched.)

Marcos even constructed a fake rationale for the imposition of martial rule: the communist scare. But as his own presidential diaries reveal, he was engaged in plans to take over the entire government since his reelection in 1969: a “Contingency Plan” in February 1970, a “new plan of government and society” in January 1971, “a possible proclamation of martial law” in early September 1972.

Given all this fakery, what’s another falsehood?

To fight the Marcos family’s continuing, highly organized, well-funded campaign to deny history, we would all need to push back against every lie—starting with the fake anniversary that is Sept. 21.",0
11,Iris Gonzales,"This time of the year between Christmas and New Year is a Dead Week of sorts, when homes are a bit quiet compared to the frantic schedule the whole year round; cities are less crowded and some families are out on vacation.

Society is on a pause of sorts and people don’t really want to do much or accomplish anything, resigned to the fact that what’s done is done.

It’s also a good time to take stock of the year that would soon be over.

Now how can we talk about 2023 without discussing politics and how it took centerstage for the most part of the year?

While both camps are denying it to the high heavens, it’s obvious that the much touted UniTeam Alliance, the electoral alliance between the Marcos and Duterte camps, is now a thing of the past.

And we’re of course treated to a ringside view of the conflict, as gripping and as tense as a Manny Pacquiao boxing fight.

I say treated because, admit or not, here in our Republic of Marites, we love being spectators in our dirty political arena. If, as Marx said, religion is the opium of the masses, politics, no doubt, is the opiate of the rest of the population.

And as I said, what a gripping boxing match it has been or still is.

There’s the House of Representatives’ successful move to strip Vice President Sara Duterte’s offices of confidential funds.

Rody Duterte came to the rescue of his daughter Sara, saying with all certainty that the realignment was politically motivated and related to the 2028 presidential polls where President Marcos’ cousin and House Speaker Martin Romualdez and the Vice President are perceived as frontrunners.

And then there’s Sara Duterte recently criticizing President Marcos for reopening peace talks with communist rebels in what marks as her first major public rebuttal of the President and his administration’s policies.

And then there’s the move of the House against Sonshine Media Network International whose program hosts have used their platform to red-tag activists and some media organizations. I don’t agree with the revocation of the franchise but I agree that the network should be investigated for all the fake news and red-tagging it has unleashed. Changes must be implemented.

Silver lining
There is a silver lining in all these moves. At last, past actions of the Duterte administration are now being rectified.

Clearly, the Dutertes’ unparalleled arrogance was no match for the stars that aligned at the House. Suddenly progressive lawmakers and the powers-that-be have become strange bedfellows. Ah, welcome to our land of the bizarre.

Bad news is that this is happening largely because of politics and as I said earlier, policy changes that are motivated by politics may not really be sustainable.

It would have been better if accountability and justice were the primary motivations to correct misdeeds of past administrations.

My fearless forecast is this politicking will continue throughout the new year.

Social concerns
We can only hope our policymakers and lawmakers won’t be so distracted that they forget there are a lot of pressing social concerns – from the worsening crisis in education to low economic productivity to food security, not to mention a possible resurgence of COVID-19.

As the recent GlobalSource report by former central bank deputy governor Diwa Guinigundo and Wilhelmina Mañalac noted, the latest Business Expectations Survey showed that Philippine businesses remained modestly positive in their outlook for the current quarter compared to the previous quarter as measured through the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Confidence Index. The index was up by only 0.1 percentage point in Q4 2023 (35.9) compared to Q3 (35.8).

There is tempered optimism, no thanks to the negative effect of the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, inflation and higher interest rates.

Thus, next year could be an even more difficult year if the downside risks to the economy such as higher inflation and lack of jobs materialize.

GlobalSource has likewise warned: “We doubt whether the government has a solution to the prolonged El Niño dry spell next year using better rice production technology.”

“This is one of the tasks cut out for the new economic czar Frederick Go – to orchestrate the deployment of public policy to mitigate pressing social concerns, not the least of which is attaining food security within the context of sustained economic growth,” it also said.

There is so much to do indeed and I hope our uncanny politics does not get in the way.

There’s only the whole of 2024 to get as many critical reforms as possible done because by 2025, our politicos will be busy preparing for the midterm elections.

What I fervently hope to see are more actions, not early campaign photo-ops; more reforms and less politicking; more policy changes for the better and less graft and corruption; more jobs for Filipinos, not just investment pledges.

As it is now, this country’s institutions have been bastardized and co-opted by selfish and self-serving politicians and corrupted to the core.

But all is not lost.

Hope springs eternal, as I always say. This is etched in my heart like a tattoo because I believe in it as much as I believe in our country and our people’s full potential.

But we all need to believe in it and demand for the changes that we deserve so that someday soon, our beloved home country will finally be the great nation that it should be.",0
12,Iris Gonzales,"In today’s newsrooms, says tycoon Manuel V. “MVP” Pangilinan, the title of “editor” is perhaps the most inaccurate.

Why so? MVP argues:

Publishers publish, reporters report and journalists work on journals. One would think that all editors do is edit.

“But your jobs – as you know – are far more important, and much more intensive than marking up your writers’ drafts. You have perhaps the most crucial job of all – which is choosing what to focus on, and deciding what the news is,” he says.

Brave new world
This is particularly important, MVP says, as he recognized the existence of artificial intelligence and its curatorial influence on information via algorithms.

But this doesn’t mean the job of the editor has become obsolete, he says.

“In fact, you are all more valuable than ever before. In cyberspace where answers are available everywhere, you determine which questions are worth asking,” says the tycoon during a recent gathering of news editors organized by the MVP Group.

Perhaps MVP, the chairman and CEO of the many companies he leads, is also well aware that consumption has changed drastically.

The same is true in the news. The way people consume news today and the way news affects the world, have significantly changed.

As MVP says, it’s a time when what confronts us is something in the mold of English author Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel, Brave New World where, the tycoon notes, “people are flooded with so much information that it’s impossible to distinguish what’s important from what’s not.”

The greatest weapons against such a threat are news editors, MVP says.

It’s one of those times when MVP, whose sprawling business empire includes stakes – big or small – in media organizations, puts the spotlight on the people who sift through the dizzying avalanche of stories every single day and decide which ones would have the biggest impact on the lives of Filipinos.

KathNiel
Times indeed are changing. Who would have thought for instance that KathNiel fans would have a collective breakdown after Filipino celebrity couple Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla announced their split after 11 years of being young lovers on-screen and off-screen?

At least one local newspaper put it on the front page, perhaps to acknowledge this heartbreak of millions of Filipinos. Television news programs interrupted their regular hard news to announce the break-up. The Singapore Straits Times carried a story about it.

Were newspapers correct in giving so much prominence to the KathNiel breakup?

At best, it was a recognition that a great big part of the Filipino population were in tears.

Perhaps, sometimes, sifting through news isn’t always about looking for stories that would make people less hungry or more hungry. It’s also about recognizing stories that affect – momentarily or otherwise – the Filipino people’s soul, something AI can’t figure out just yet.

Perhaps, it’s no coincidence that MVP reminded us about Huxley’s Brave New World, which warned against a society devoid of deep connections that make us truly human and alive.

More imported meat from Brazil
Speaking of hard news and gut issues, some recent news from Brazil caught my attention.

Brazil, the world’s top chicken exporter and home to giant meatpackers, announced in early November that it was extending an avian flu-related national health emergency for another 180 days due to more detections of the virus.

The South American country has confirmed avian flu cases in wild birds as early as May 2023 and declared a health emergency a week later.

Just last Nov. 7, Brazil announced that it was extending the national health emergency, Reuters has reported.

Japan had imposed a temporary ban on Brazilian chicken products coming from Espirito Santo state in late June and from Santa Catarina, Brazil’s second largest producer and exporter of chicken, in mid-July.

Although Brazil said the highly infectious virus has not yet reached commercial flocks, it has 139 confirmed outbreaks of the disease, including in wild birds, subsistence poultry and mammals, the Reuters report also said.

Against this backdrop, I’m curious why the Philippines wants to pave the way for more meat imports from Brazil.

The South American country is seeking system-wide accreditation that will allow its establishments to export animals, meat and meat products to the Philippines.

Thus, in a special order last month, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said he is sending an inspection mission to Brazil for the accreditation of Brazilian foreign meat establishments.

Normally, this is just a standard procedure. When countries want to export meat and meat products to the Philippines, they need to apply for systemwide accreditation which would entail actual inspection of their animal health and safety standards.

But there are many factors at play here. Why do we want to bring in more meat imports at this time and from a country with confirmed cases of avian flu?

Brazil’s meat products such as beef, pork or chicken parts could directly compete with Filipino farmers who are already struggling.

As it is now, mechanically deboned meat or those used to make products such as sausage, nuggets, luncheon meat, etc. already enjoy a two-year, five percent tariff rate which exporters are currently enjoying. The Marcos administration has extended the lower tariffs to end-2024.

Imports help ensure the continued supply of food products in the country at affordable prices but as I’ve said before, we must also make sure that our local industries get enough support.",0
13,Iris Gonzales,"After more than a year and after several other names cropped up in the business grapevine, at last we finally have an agriculture secretary.

Newly appointed Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. will be racing against time because of the enormity of the work that needs to be done – from ensuring food security to addressing specific problems of our local industries.

This early, there are already some hiccups – expected of course – including the fact that he did not graduate from the University of Santo Tomas despite official documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying so. (Congratulations to campus journalists from The Varsitarian for putting the spotlight on this).

Hiccups aside, I hope he will be able to improve a sector that was once upon a time, our country’s pride, hope and source of economic growth.

It’s a challenging task for sure and one must be a bit crazy to accept the agriculture post especially in these hard times. But then again, sometimes the crazy are the ones who get things done. We’ll see about that.

My hope is that he would be open to huge changes in the present structure of the Department of Agriculture and work closely with people on the ground – the farmers, the fisherfolk, the local government units.

As I said before, the present structure of the agriculture department is from the top down wherein plans and programs emanate from the top with hardly any consultation from those on the ground and implemented in a one-size-fits all manner. This isn’t always effective because different regions have different problems.

Sec. Laurel can change this by working closely with the different LGUs because they are the ones who are in touch with the farmers. The farmers know and listen to the LGUs’ provincial agriculture and municipal officers, as former agriculture undersecretary Dr. Cristino “Resty” Collado pointed out.

This could help a lot in determining how to allocate food production budget, say the rice production budget, for example. Those in the top 10 rice producing regions should be prioritized while top performers can be rewarded with a higher budget from the DA.

Rice
In the food hierarchy, three major commodities must be tackled properly – rice, meat and sugar, as I said before.

Rice is top in the hierarchy, the mainstay in every Filipino meal.

Sec. Laurel would have to create an effective partnership with farmers to boost rice productivity. This, in turn, can be done with the DA and the different LGUs working together.

For example, the local chieftains can distribute seeds and fertilizer directly to the target. They can identify which areas need to be prioritized the most.

Pork, chicken

Next in the food hierarchy is pork. Whether we like it or not, healthy or otherwise, we are such a meat eating country.

Welcome to this lechon republic!

Indeed, meat products, mainly pork and chicken, are the usual food items that most Filipinos complement with rice.

Also, the price of pork is the lead barometer used to plan for family food budgets. Prices of poultry and fish follow when prices of pork go up.

Speaking of meat, we are also having problems with cheap imports.

Industry sources have said that a lot of meat products have been kept in cold storage facilities for months on end.

Normally, this is allowed but in recent months, there have been numerous reports of some of these meat products stored far too long and no longer fit for consumption yet are finding their way into stores and wet markets in the country without any information on their expiry or production dates.

The least the government can do is to make sure that every product sold to consumers is properly labeled.

Raids by the DA months ago and industry monitoring from local producers have shown that tubs and tubs of unbranded and spoiled chicken products are sold in some wet markets such as those in Bulacan and Caloocan.

There are even reports that a cold storage operator in northern Luzon buys imported meat products – some of which may be expired – and sells these goods to food kiosks selling chickens, dumplings, etc. This is a horror story, if true.

The DA must be vigilant and must look into these reports that’s been going around the industry.

Data from the Bureau of Animal Industry showed that the country bought 289.52 million kilograms of chicken overseas in the first eight months of the year, 35.4 percent higher compared to the 244.8 million a year ago.

Not surprisingly, our local meat producers are hurting.

Sugar
And then there’s the bitter situation surrounding our sugar industry, which is now on the brink of extinction due to neglect and our obsession with imports.

Importing goods of course is always the more convenient route because these goods are cheaper.

But there’s always the issue of smuggling and poor quality of imported food, especially meat products.

The different problems surrounding our top commodities point to a common solution and that is to increase local production. This is of course easier said than done and may not be the fastest solution.

But for the sake of our farmers, producers and for our own food security, we must do it.

How we get there under Sec. Laurel’s leadership remains to be seen. Would he be able to strike that delicate balance between ensuring affordable food prices and strengthening local production?

I hope we find out soon enough.",0
14,Iris Gonzales,"The P48-billion budget overrun reported by telco giant PLDT marks another chapter in its long, colorful and winding history – 94 years and counting.

It’s a major development for the country’s oldest and largest telecommunications giant and even PLDT chairman Manuel V. “MVP” Pangilinan’s arowana knows it.

MVP shared on Twitterverse on Monday that his arowana died, a death which feng shui believers consider a “noble sacrifice.”

Indeed, many believe that when an arowana dies, it is often a noble sacrifice that takes away the bad luck or misfortune that has befallen a household or perhaps a business.

“Probably absorbed all the angst of PLDT on our behalf,” MVP said.

Often called the “dragon fish” because its metallic coin-like scales undulate like the paper dragons we see during Chinese New Year, the arowana has spawned the belief that the fish brings good luck and prosperity. It’s no surprise it’s a favorite among Asian elite.

True or not, one thing is clear. Investors are waiting with bated breath for the result of PLDT’s internal investigation on the budget overrun.

Impairment
As I write this, PLDT is set to talk to investors and analysts. Reporters covering the beat are staking out. By the time this column comes out, PLDT may have already clarified the issues. It said last week that it has not uncovered fraudulent transactions or procurement anomalies.

Even MVP’s business rival Ramon “RSA” Ang, who knows the nature of a telco business, believes it was unlikely that the overrun was due to fraud.

It was not ‘mathematically possible’ to defraud a company of P48 billion, Ang said.

Instead, it may have been more of an impairment issue arising from some – and expensive – telco network equipment that may have been acquired but was not used as intended or did not deliver on its intended use. This might have been largely due to tech factors such as becoming obsolete or being no longer applicable in certain areas by the time the different types of equipment were delivered.

RSA noted that in the telco business, this can happen because there are many moving parts and technology changes in the wink of an eye. Thus, what may be applicable or needed today may no longer be useful tomorrow.

Another source said the P48 billion refers to equipment already in use that was not yet officially accepted. Thus it is not yet recorded in the books of PLDT. This means they aren’t depreciated yet in accounting terms.

The source said that “if you use the average life of ten years,” depreciation would have reduced the operating income by P4.8 billion a year and about P3.6 billion after tax.

Ambulance chasers
Ambulance chasers have already smelled blood. News from the US showed that US law firms are urging affected investors to file a complaint against the telco giant.

We will now have to wait and see what happens next, including the results of the inquiry of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Everyone is waiting with bated breath.

What is clear for now is that this development will certainly mark a major chapter in PLDT’s long, corporate history.

Philippine Airlines sees milestone profit year

Over at another company, Philippine Airlines, the country’s flag carrier, is reaping the benefits of the travel industry’s recovery.

PAL expects to record a milestone profit year for 2022, thanks to revenge travel.

In a recent chat, PAL president and COO Capt. Stanley Ng  said almost all routes are back to pre-pandemic levels except China, which only just started to ease COVID-19 related curbs.

For the third quarter of the year, PAL registered an operating income of P4.9 billion and comprehensive income of P4.2 billion.

This brought nine-month income to P11.5 billion and the comprehensive income to P8.3 billion, signifying the continuing resurgence of the Philippines’ only full-service network airline amid the ongoing recovery of air travel and tourism.

But Capt. Stanley said there’s still a lot of work to be done to sustain growth.

These include further improving PAL’s customer service, adding more flights and opening new routes.

PAL just opened a new route between Cebu and Baguio City last Dec. 16, marking PAL’s comeback to Baguio, the very first destination it served nearly 82 years ago.

“So we are happy to be flying back to where it all started,” Capt. Stanley said.

PAL to Europe
PAL may also return to Europe by 2025, “an aspirational target,” he said during our chat, just days after he arrived from Brussels where he joined President Marcos in a meeting with Brussels Airport CEO Arnaud Feist.

This happened at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-European Union (ASEAN-EU) Commemorative Summit last week.

Last mile
PAL wingwoman Cielo Villaluna also shared with me that PAL will soon have a last mile shipping service, which will be a game changer for the cargo industry and would be beneficial to Filipinos, especially in this age of speedy deliveries.

Things indeed are looking up for PAL but as Capt. Stanley said, the flag carrier still has a lot of room for improvement.

I’ve been on a few PAL flights recently and I have no issues. I even raved about the excellent in-flight food from Manila to New York but I continue to hear a lot of horror stories from other passengers – from lost baggage to delayed flights to the long wait for their bags at the conveyor belt.

May all these problems be resolved sooner than later so that Filipinos and visitors alike can truly enjoy traveling, whether for business or pleasure.",0
15,Iris Gonzales,"The sun is out, the storm has passed. The Paeng-induced bedlam has died down at least for now. It’s business as usual again at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), the country’s main gateway.

The past few days, however, a different kind of mayhem descended into the airport; of how a new general manager has been appointed, surprising NAIA insiders and the whole industry.

But as I write this piece on this sunny Monday morning, I’m told that it’s still business as usual at the airport after all, despite news of a new Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) general manager.

Transportation Secretary Jaime “JJB” Bautista also confirmed to me that it’s another day at work for MIAA general manager Cesar Chiong.

“It’s business as usual,” Sec. JJB said.

This is good news, some airport insiders said. Many of them are happy with GM Chiong’s leadership style.

“He is doing very well. Everyone is inspired to work. His style of management is that of the private sector,” one insider shared with me.

By private sector-like leadership style, they meant that GM Chiong is professional, listens to everyone and makes a decision based on what is best for all.

Sec. JJB said the same thing. Even members of the board of directors of MIAA have been actively participating in meetings now, just like in the boardrooms of private corporations, he said.

GM Chiong is a veteran aviation executive with at least 30 years experience with Philippine Airlines, Air Philippines and in San Miguel Corp. prior to joining the government, said Sec. JJB, who handpicked him for MIAA.

Reforms
He has been instituting reforms and has been going after those with unpaid financial obligations to the airport, insiders said. The money was meant to finance improvements such as in the different terminals and in digitizing airport processes.

These efforts may have ruffled some feathers who might have lobbied for leadership changes in MIAA, sources said.

Snake pit
This shouldn’t be the case, really. Serving in government shouldn’t feel like being in a snake pit and that you could lose your job any moment.

Unfortunately, it seems the most uncertain job positions these days – as uncertain as in Elon Musk’s Twitter – are in government.

How many ranking Palace officials have had to leave for unclear reasons the past months? Is this a reflection of the supposed power play among the different groups in this administration?

I heard there are eight power blocks surrounding the President. If true, they put the PNoy-era Samar and Balay rivalry to shame.

Gods of NAIA
On a serious note, I hope to see the continuation of reforms in our airports, especially in NAIA, the country’s most important gateway. If GM Chiong is seriously fixing the problems including weeding out money-making syndicates, then let this continue.

There are a lot of changes that need to be implemented to improve airport operations. Otherwise, we will continue to experience mayhem whenever there are calamities or extraordinary situations such as holidays, which are peak seasons for traveling.

GM Chiong has a lot more to do to improve airport operations. I wrote about the Paeng-related mess two weeks ago. Six years won’t be enough to implement lasting changes in the airport but if we keep changing the leadership in the middle of reforms, we would just be going around in circles.

Many of our longtime airport officials and rank-and-file workers are smart, hardworking and sincere civil servants. They deserve a competent leader.

Controversial positions such as airport GMs should never be politicized. In fact, anyone trying to reform our gateways – or any government agency for that matter – by weeding out money-making syndicates or the so-called Gods of NAIA should have the full backing of the President.

These syndicates have been getting their way for decades now. Isn’t this the reason why past private sector attempts to take over the operations and management of NAIA – even with the combined strength of seven of the country’s biggest conglomerates – never prospered?

At the end of the day, without improvements in our airports, it is the traveling public who will continue to suffer. More often than not, when we fly in and fly out, we experience chaos in our airports.

While fixing NAIA, we should also have a new and alternative gateway.

Bulacan Airport
Sec. JJB shared with me that during the weekend, he and his team also inspected the progress of the New Manila International Airport or the Bulacan International Airport of San Miguel Corp.

There’s been significant progress, says Sec. JJB, referring to the massive dredging works on the site of the airport and he is excited. I hope that indeed we will finally see a new and alternative gateway in the years to come. We needed a new airport yesterday.

Home
I dream to see the day when we can all pass through a gateway that is among the best in the world, one that is consistently efficient and excellent; one that is comfortable and convenient for each and every passenger and not just for Business Class or VIP travelers; one that will give us an enjoyable experience between flights; one that isn’t just business as usual but so much better.

The airport is that last thing we see when we depart and the first thing that welcomes us when we come home.

Passing through it shouldn’t feel like walking the gauntlet but should feel like a piece of home, as if we’re back in the warm embrace of a loved one.",0
16,Iris Gonzales,"For two straight years now, the Philippine economy performed weaker than expected. It grew by 5.6 percent last year, missing the government’s six to 6.5 percent target, only slightly better than the 5.5 percent economic performance in 2023, which was lowered from 5.6 percent and which was also below the government’s six to seven percent target for that year. It was also short of the 7.6 percent recorded in 2022.

More than the numbers, Filipinos are feeling the pinch. Try doing your usual grocery run and you will easily notice that prices of your usual food items continue to skyrocket. Prices of gasoline remain unabated. Prices of utilities such as water also increased at the start of the year.

Against this backdrop, what is the Marcos administration doing to resolve our economic woes? It has been implementing measures to make available rice at P29 per kilo but what about the rest of the commodities?

Prices of agricultural goods continue to sell at high prices, something that industry sources said should be blamed on the cartel.

New normal
Commenting on last year’s growth, NEDA undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon said the country faced numerous setbacks like extreme weather events, geopolitical tensions and subdued global demand, similar to the challenges we encountered in 2023. 
She said this is now the new normal and therefore, the Philippines, she said, must build resilience to cope with these setbacks.

The agriculture sector in particular faced several setbacks, particularly between late October until mid-November, when six typhoons struck the country in succession. These extreme weather conditions led to a 1.8 percent year-on-year contraction in the agriculture, forestry and fishery sectors in the fourth quarter of 2024, she said.
Manufacturing likewise grew by only 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, hampered by subdued global demand due to geopolitical tensions and the slow recovery of advanced economies.

To cope with the challenging times, the government will look at other sectors to drive growth. Tourism and the IT-BPM sector are among the areas the government is eyeing, Usec. Edillon said.

New tourism products, such as those under experiential tourism, for instance, are being developed.

“In the information technology and business process management (IT-BPM) sector, we will strengthen our talent pipeline through reskilling and upskilling programs, ensuring that the workforce remains competitive in high-value services. This will also support the recovery of the real estate sector, which has been affected by shifts in workplace preferences,” she said.

The government needs to act fast. Its current slow pace of interventions is dragging the economy down.

Foreign investments are not coming in because of corruption and bureaucratic cobwebs. Most of what the government is trumpeting now are approved pledges and it will take time before we feel its impact, if they do decide to invest in the Philippines.

As it is now, business chambers are saying that the Philippines is not getting investments as much as our ASEAN neighbors such as Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand.

The proposed P200-per-day wage hike may make things worse for the economy. For one, it is inflationary and we doubt that small and medium enterprises will be able to afford it. Actually, even big businesses are already warning against it.

Agribank at the forefront of consolidation
Good news for Agribank, the bank under the Ropali Group of Companies.

I learned that the Monetary Board last month approved the consolidation of four rural banks – Agribusiness Rural Bank Inc., Banco Alabang Inc., Rural Bank of Maddela and Rural Bank of San Jacinto (Masbate) Inc.

The result is a unified institution known as Agribusiness Banking Corp., a rural bank which will carry the same business name, Agribank.

Constituent banks applied under the BSP’s Mergers and Consolidation of the Rural Bank Strengthening Program, which is part of BSP’s broader and continuing efforts to boost the resilience of the rural banking industry.

Expansion
Combining their network, the consolidated bank will initially operate 43 branches nationwide and plans to expand its presence to 100 branches in the next five years.

“This consolidation reflects our commitment to work together as one, united by a shared purpose – to empower our clients and promote financial inclusion in the rural banking sector,” said Agribank president and CEO Danny Boy Antonio. “By consolidating, we are not just combining resources – we are building a stronger institution, equipped to offer innovative, convenient and inclusive financial services.”

He also highlighted digital transformation as a key priority, which is all about modernizing banking by introducing digital services to the public.

JTI Philippines names new GM
JTI Philippines has announced that it has named Guilherme Silva as its new general manager effective January 2025.

It’s a comeback for Silva who was marketing director in the Philippines in 2011. He has since held various leadership roles across other JTI markets – as head of JTI Cambodia in 2014, GM of JTI Malaysia in 2016, marketing and sales vice president of the Western Europe Region in 2018 and, most recently, GM of the Iberia cluster of Spain, Portugal, Canary Islands, Andorra and Gibraltar since 2020.

“I am excited to be back in the Philippines to lead a very dynamic market where JTI is now the country’s fastest growing tobacco company in terms of market share. I look forward to seeing how we continue to grow our portfolio and business through product innovation and consumer-centric programs,” says Silva.",0
17,Iris Gonzales,"Some tycoons get what they want; others have to roll with the punches, though this isn’t unique to the Marcos administration.

Every other president since Marcos Sr., after all, has had a close circle of businessmen friends, cronies, posses or whatever they’re called. Even the profanity-laden Rody Duterte – he who vowed “to destroy the oligarchs” – had his well-loved and favored Davao Group, and whatever attempts to destroy whoever merely focused on those from Imperial Manila.

Now, under Marcos 2.0, we call them advisers, advising President BBM on what to do or what not to do.

Very early on, an unsolicited piece of advice, my sources say, was to break the natural monopoly of the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines, the country’s sole grid operator, led by tycoons Henry Sy Jr. and Robert Coyiuto Jr.

For years, other tycoons have also been eyeing NGCP, looking for a way to get into the picture or, if not, get one foot inside.

Fast forward to today. Here now is the country’s first sovereign wealth fund, Maharlika, announcing its historic and maiden investment, in NGCP no less. Could it be possible that in the future Maharlika would sell its stake or a portion of it to another investor – perhaps someone who has long been eyeing NGCP? There have been similar situations in the past, such as when GSIS sold its stake in Meralco.

It is possible, say my sources privy to the matter. Thus, in the future, NGCP may see other tycoons come into the picture.

I’m sure the lawyers of Sy and Coyiuto have put in place protective clauses in the deal but we never really know what can happen next, just as NGCP’s shareholders surely did not expect the Marcos administration to buy into their company.

Maharlika Investment Corp. president and CEO Joel Consing is already hinting that should the shares of the State Grid Corp. of China in NGCP be available, they would also be interested.

The next investment
After NGCP, what’s next for Maharlika?

Consing said they would make an announcement soon after the market absorbs the NGCP news. Another source hinted that there’s a couple of deals Maharlika is eyeing, although it wouldn’t be as big as NGCP.

Will our power situation improve?

With Maharlika getting a 20 percent stake in NGCP, will our power situation improve as promised by the Marcos administration?

Only time will tell but I’m not holding my breath.

The Philippine power industry, after all, is one big industry filled with moving parts.

The Energy Regulatory Commission, the power regulator, itself is filled with bureaucratic cobwebs, with decisions taking way too long to be handed down.

As Sy, in a recent hearing at the House of Representatives, said, there is indeed a need for stability not just in the power grid but also in supply, law, policy and regulation, for a more robust power industry.

“I strongly urge the DOE to look at the problem as a whole. The data is clear, 97 percent of the power interruptions from 2016 to 2023 was caused by problems in supply. We need stable, affordable base-load power. We need a comprehensive, aligned plan that considers the needs of all sectors. We are willing to be part of the solution, but transmission should not be the solution to everyone’s problems.”

Now that the first month of the year is almost over and the Chinese New Year has ushered in the Year of the Snake, investors are all eagerly awaiting who will be the first to debut in the Philippine stock market this 2025.

At the Bankers’ Night held early January, Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) president Ramon Monzon said this year’s curtain-raisers could be Maynilad or Topline. Another source, however, said that Maynilad will likely wait until after the midterm elections in May to get a better grasp of the political situation, which could influence the regulatory environment.

Another market source said this year’s curtain-raiser could be Globe Telecom’s GCash. Asked about GCash’s IPO, PSE director Vivian Yuchengco, whom I bumped into in Makati recently, said that if GCash proceeds with its listing soon, it would indeed be a good curtain-raiser for the PSE as it would attract the foreign investors.

Whichever it is, investors are eagerly awaiting for the next market debutant to ring the bell.

As for Monzon, he says anytime is as good a time as any to list in the market.

One curtain-raiser can take the lead and others can follow, he said. We need to catch up with our neighbors, as we have long been lagging behind.

Malaysia had 46 IPOs from January to November last year while Thailand had 29. The Philippines had only three – NexGen, OceanaGold and Citicore.",0
18,Iris Gonzales,"And the deal is done.

Maharlika Investment Corp. (MIC), the state-owned corporation that manages the country’s sovereign wealth fund, has made its first ever investment – a 20 percent stake in the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines.

On Sunday, sources said that the negotiations between Maharlika and NGCP have concluded although some details were still being threshed out at the time.

Yesterday afternoon, following a signing at the Palace, Malacañang announced that the deal was done. MIC president and CEO Rafael Consing Jr. and SGP chairman Henry “Big Boy” Sy Jr. signed the agreement in a ceremony witnessed by President Marcos.

It wasn’t a walk in the park though. The horse trading was intense, at times held at Maharlika’s headquarters in Bonifacio Global City or at NGCP’s office in San Juan.

But after months of exhausting negotiations, Big Boy himself was relieved that the talks had concluded, a source said.

In its announcement, the Palace said Synergy Grid and Development Philippines Inc. (SGP) has accepted a binding offer from the Marcos administration, through the MIC, for a 20 percent stake to secure a foothold in NGCP.

Under the binding term sheet, MIC will subscribe to preferred shares offered by SGP.

SGP holds a 40.2 percent effective ownership interest in NGCP, the country’s power grid operator. Consing said the deal would grant MIC two board seats each at SGP and NGCP.

“Once the acquisition is completed, we shall be entitled to two out of nine seats in the SGP board, after the total seats are increased from seven to nine. At NGCP, the government gains representation through two out of 15 board seats, following an increase in the total seats from 10 to 15,” Consing said.

NGCP is owned by Sy and another Filipino tycoon, Robert “RCJ” Coyiuto Jr., with their technical partner State Grid of China, which holds a 40 percent stake.

Currently, the NGCP board is chaired by Zhu Guangchao (Chinese), while Sy and Coyiuto serve as co-vice chairmen. Members include Jose Pardo, Francis Chua, Yao Yousheng (Chinese), Wang Lijin (Chinese), Anthony Almeda, Liu Xinhua (Chinese) and Paul Sagayo Jr.

Now the next question on everyone’s mind is this – what was the price that convinced tycoons Big Boy and RCJ to let Maharlika in?

According to the grapevine, the two tycoons wanted a price closer to P20 per share due to NGCP’s future growth potential compared to SGP’s current share price of P12.90 per share.

As I said in an earlier column, US-based investment fund manager Eric Jurado’s valuation analysis puts SGP’s fair price at P10.20 per share, based on earnings growth of 4.4 percent per year over the past five years. This equates to an expected shareholder return of 10.4 percent per year over the next five years.

As for the total acquisition cost, we can only speculate for now while waiting for more details.

Our energy reporter Brix Lelis quoted an analyst who said that Maharlika may invest as much as P8.5 billion to secure at least a 10-percent stake SGP.

“Assuming the Maharlika Fund acquires a 10-percent interest or around 526 million shares of SGP, Peter Garnace of Unicapital Inc. estimates that a ‘fair value’ should range from P6 billion to P8.5 billion, or P12 to P16.10 per share.

“Based on previous equity transactions (that is) 2021 FOO (follow-on offering), SGP was priced at P12 apiece,” Garnace told The STAR.”

Lelis’ report also said that based on the company’s book value, it is valued at P20.13 per share as of September 2024.

Unicapital’s Garnace said: “Hence, by applying a minority discount, we arrive at an adjusted fair value of P8.5 billion or P16.10 per share.”

Questions remain
For analyst Nicky Franco of Abacus Securities, however, the question shouldn’t be about the price but whether or not it’s a worthy investment for Maharlika.

These are points that Maharlika needs to explain to the public, especially because it is a sovereign wealth fund whose initial capitalization is from government-owned banks.

Launched at WEF 2023
For now, what is clear is that after all the controversies surrounding it, the Switzerland-launched sovereign wealth fund has finally come up with a maiden investment two years after Marcos trumpeted Maharlika at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in January 2023.

At the recent WEF last week, the Philippine government’s delegation, led by House Speaker Martin Romualdez and Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, likewise touted the sovereign wealth fund.

The pressure is now on Maharlika to show that its investment in NGCP is justified.

More importantly, the Marcos administration must be ready to answer if investors raise concerns about the sovereign wealth fund.

For instance, can Maharlika just acquire a stake in any company whether or not shareholders like it, just as it did in NGCP? Or should I just be asking what’s the next target after the grid operator?

Only time will tell. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens next.",0
19,Iris Gonzales,"Vice President Sara Duterte trended on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday evening. The hashtag #zerobudgetforOVP or Office of the Vice President was among the top trends.

By Wednesday morning, the hashtag #SaraDuterte was trending with 50,000 posts as X users expressed frustration and anger over the way she handled Tuesday’s six-hour hearing at the House of Representatives, which focused on the Office of the Vice President’s proposed P2-billion budget for 2025.

VP Sara would know for sure why she trended and while she may shrug it off, her handlers should know that trends on X hold a lot of importance as they give insights into what the public cares about, providing a real-time pulse on society.

Watching the hearing, one doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry and it would take more than one column piece to dissect the layers of pain that any nation-loving Filipino must have felt while watching the televised constitutionally mandated exercise by the House of Representatives.

The most painful and profoundly sad part of it all is the most obvious – our Vice President, the second highest official of the land, voted into office by 32 million Filipinos, not only refused to answer queries about the use of her office’s budget, but also threw a tantrum precisely because she was being questioned.

Her words, her body language and her overall presence exuded a kind of intense anger and irritation you might see only in say, your mother when you’ve done something so awfully wrong or your high school principal when you’ve violated the school’s rules and regulations.

In the case of the budget hearing, however, it was not the lawmakers – representing the public – who were in the wrong but VP Sara herself for refusing to answer the questions on how her office used its past budgets.

Her refusal was wrong on so many levels because one, she felt that she was exempt from being scrutinized, even if the budget she was asking for is funded by taxpayers’ money; and second, because she absolutely disregarded parliamentary courtesy.

Nobody, however, is exempt from scrutiny when it comes to taxpayers’ money, as Gabriela Women’s Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas said during the hearing.

Our government officials must remember that public service is a public trust; that budgets are funded by taxpayers’ money and that nobody, indeed, is exempt from scrutiny – whether you are the president, the VP, the lawmakers or a small-town mayor.

What a sad state of affairs we’re in.

Princess Sara
Sadder, even more so, was when the Vice President asked that the chairperson of the “House finance committee” be the presiding officer of the hearing instead of Marikina City 2nd District Rep. Stella Luz Quimbo, the presiding officer of Tuesday’s hearing by the House committee on appropriations.

This was surprising, and perhaps an unprecedented move.

But most of all, it was a testament to VP Sara’s strong sense of entitlement, frustrated perhaps that she was in the hot seat and being grilled nonstop.

Perhaps, this is not something she is used to, having been Davao’s princess for the longest time.

This, however, is really about the use of taxpayers’ money. It’s about accountability and transparency. Crying politics or being politicized just doesn’t make sense. It matters more how the funds were utilized than whether or not lawmakers were politicizing the budget hearing.

Of course, some of them were politicizing it. They are all politicians after all, including the VP herself. As Aristotle, in his political studies, once said, human beings are by nature political animals “because nature, which does nothing in vain, has equipped them with speech, which enables them to communicate moral concepts such as justice which are formative of the household and city-state.”

VP Sara could have simply answered the questions if only to show her respect toward people’s money, and to the House of Representatives as an institution, regardless of the ongoing political drama between the Duterte and the Marcos camps.

But she has opted otherwise. The result is one big mess. What happens next is anybody’s guess.

It’s a sad time for our country and our institutions. It’s sad, too, that our lawmakers didn’t do enough to prevent the hearing from descending into chaos.

But how could they have prevented it? Some of them, perhaps too shocked to react, could not even compose a simple, coherent sentence – whether in English or Tagalog.

This also speaks volumes on the kind of lawmakers we have today. I imagine statesmen of decades past rolling over in their graves. But that’s another story.

Sad times, indeed.

At best though, the hearing was at least wildly entertaining, a dark comedy of sorts – just as it usually is here in our nation of 119 million when chaos gets the best of us.

20,Iris Gonzales,"They called themselves delinquents — four adventurous college students from the University of the Philippines who were strangers to each other at first, but brought together by a profound love for music.

Indeed, they weren’t able to graduate because from UP, their music took them to dark, smoke-filled performance venues and later on, across the Philippines and beyond.

But as destiny would have it, 30 years later, these college dropouts would be bestowed with the highest distinction, the Gawad Oblation Award, from their beloved Alma Mater.

Such is the poetic and mind-bending story of the Eraserheads, which entered into yet another chapter last Aug. 20 as its members Marcus Adoro, Ely Buendia, Raimund Marasigan and Buddy Zabala each received a Gawad Oblation Medal, awarded to them by no less than UP president Angelo Jimenez.

It was a full circle moment of sorts and a sweet homecoming for the four erstwhile bandmates.

Their adventure started at the sprawling UP Diliman Campus in Quezon City in the late ‘80s.


Ely gives a 'thank you' speech.
And from the confines of the Kalayaan Residence Hall, the dorm exclusively for freshmen students, to the steps of the College of Arts and Sciences and many other places in between, the enduring story of the Eraserheads unfolded.

The Eraserheads started as a little known band, deriving its name from David Lynch’s disturbing and surreal 1977 movie “Eraserhead.”

The group was born sometime in 1987 when Raimund, Marcus and Buddy responded to a call for auditions which Ely posted because he was trying to form a band.

The rest, as they say, is history.
The rest, as they say, is history.

Young boys from the provinces, the bandmates said their life expanded when they went to UP or as Zabala puts it, “exploded.”

True enough, they would become the legendary and iconic Filipino rock band for the ages.

And little did they know that 30 years after leaving UP, they would make history as this year’s recipients of the Gawad Oblation Award.

Launched in 2017, the award is bestowed on UP alumni and friends alike for their significant contributions to the university.

The elegant Gawad Oblation Medal, encircled by a green and maroon ribbon, the colors of the University, “is a symbol of UP’s deep gratitude for the extraordinary service rendered with or in the name of UP,” said Jimenez during the awarding ceremony held at the Executive House.

The Eraserheads, he said, “are a pivotal force in the history of Original Pilipino Music, helping define the music, memories and identity of a generation, no less.”


Members of the UP Delta Lambda Sigma Alumnae Association, including the author (center), pose with Ely and Raimund during the Gawad Oblation awarding ceremony.
Jimenez knew what he was talking about. His time in UP overlapped with that of the Eraserheads. Jimenez earned his Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1987 and then went to finish his Law studies.

Back then, Jimenez recalled in his speech, the Eraserheads were already a big name on campus.

“The band revolutionized OPM by introducing a new sound, blending alternative rock with traditional Filipino elements including Western rock styles, but with distinctly Pinoy sensibilities,” Jimenez also said.

At the awarding ceremony, the band members were not in their usual rock and roll fashion but were all dapper in their Barong Tagalog and leather shoes.

Guests — family, friends, ranking officials of UP and members of the press — descended into the glittering venue also in their Filipiniana wear.

It was a formal, almost solemn affair even as one could feel an undercurrent of highly-charged energy among the crowd.

This was no surprise as giddy fans, young and old, were all excited to bear witness to a historic and momentous occasion.

The UP Symphony Orchestra String Quartet performed a medley of the band’s songs, the only Eraserheads music the guests would get that night.

But while the awardees didn’t perform, the whole evening was poetry in motion as the Eraserheads shared their stories from their UP days.

There on stage, not as performers but as UP Gawad Oblation awardees, each of the band members took the spotlight and thanked the people who joined them in their journey.

“Nagpapasalamat kami sa UP Library na nagpapatatag ng aming pundasyong intelektwal; sa UP Sunken Garden para sa gabing walang kasing-saya, sa madidilim ng sulok ng Beta Way at Lagoon para sa mga gabing punong-puno ng lambing,” said Marcus.

He also said it was in UP where they experienced real freedom.

“Kalayaan pumili at maghayag, kalayaan sundin at kalayaan pakingan ang sariling himig.”

On behalf of the band, Raimund thanked everyone who were part of their journey, especially their parents for supporting them even though they weren’t able to bring home college diplomas.

His mother was present that night, beaming with pride.

Buddy, who hailed from Zamboanga said their experiences in the university shaped their music and storytelling.

Ely shared the same view, saying UP shaped not just their minds but their souls. He thanked the university for “giving us the foundation to create, explore and challenge the status quo.”

Dr. Robin Rivera, their former professor, and Francis Lumen, chairman and chief executive officer of WEU Event Management Services, gave their testimonials that evening.

The next day, on his Instagram account, Ely posted about the event, calling it “a night to remember.” A fan commented, “It was like the Beatles being knighted.”

It certainly was a memorable occasion for four college dropouts who finally had a graduation of sorts, 30 years later.

That evening, one could see how happy they were to be back in the warm embrace of their Alma Mater, an institution which helped them find their wings and soar to greater heights.

Along the way, they, too, helped generations and generations of Filipinos get along through life and through the bad times — with a little prayer and a song.",0
21,Maria A. Ressa,"Even as we see what's being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now,' says Rappler CEO Maria Ressa in a speech at the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health Commencement Ceremonies
Rappler CEO Maria Ressa addressed the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health’s Class of 2019 on Sunday, August 11, urging them to build their identity, profession, and the nation’s democracy by embracing their values, their fears, and their journey. 

A total of 148 graduates received their dual MD/Master of Business Administration degrees. 

“You will help define what our society will look like and how our democracy will survive and evolve,” she told the graduates at the Meralco Theater. “This is a time of creative destruction. Even as we see what’s being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now,” she said.

Below is the full text of her speech.

Congratulations, Class of 2019!

You’re graduating at an existential moment in history. 

When global power structures are turned upside down by technology, triggering an erosion of all our rights.

When journalists around the world are under attack, democracy is under attack. 

I know this firsthand: in 14 months, the Philippine government filed at least 11 cases and investigations. I was arrested twice in a 5-week period early this year, and I’ve posted bail 8 times in about 3 months. In order to travel, I have to post more than P500,000 in bonds. 

Journalism is not a crime. 

Yet, I’ve seen social media and our legal system weaponized against us – and any other perceived critics of government. 

We hold the line. Because we live our mission. Because – as Time Magazine wrote – we are the Guardians of Truth.

This battle for truth is the battle of our generation.  

Now more than ever, we know that information is power. Without the right information, it’s impossible to fight back – whether it’s to find a cure for a disease or to hold power to account.

We need to fight the insidious manipulation social media technology platforms have allowed: where lies laced with anger and hate spread faster than facts.  

These lies are like a virus that has infected our information ecosystem, playing to the worst of human nature, turning us against each other. They replicate and cripple our body politique – spreading a disease that still has no cure.  

A lie told a million times becomes a fact. Without facts, we don’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust.  

This is why democracy is broken, not just in the Philippines but around the world. 

I’d like to share 3 lessons with you as you go into battle for your identity, your profession, our democracy. 

Embrace your values because with that comes your humanity.
Embrace your fears.
Embrace your journey.  
Embrace your values 

Remember why you chose to become a doctor. 

You chose a specialized degree that has an embedded mission for a broken society. Seven out of 10 Filipinos die without ever seeing a doctor, and the statistics promise you no sleep — like: only 3 public doctors for every 100,000 people.

To those who chose business, how are you going to fight corruption? 

Life is all about making choices. That’s what we do every minute of the day. 

These little choices define who you are, and if you’re not clear about your values, you may wake up when you’re older and realize you don’t like the person you’ve become. 

Every choice defines who you are, and they could be really simple like choosing to turn right instead of left – they lead to different paths. Or accepting a bribe because in your mind you’ve rationalized it as a gift.  

Character is created in the sum of all these little choices we make.  

Now, while you’re sitting there before going into battle, choose the values that define you. Do it now. Because when you’re tested – and it will come if it hasn’t already – you have to know the lines you’ve set. 

Draw the line: on this side you’re good; on this side you’re evil.  

This is what prevents situational ethics. This makes sure you can’t rationalize bad behavior. 

You don’t really know who you are until you’re forced to defend it. Then every battle you win, or lose, every compromise you choose to make…or to walk away from – all these struggles define the values you live by and, ultimately, who you are. 

Then when you’re in battle, avoid the hate: the US against THEM, rich vs poor, dilawan vs DDS – these labels are meant to divide us. Populism is easy. Real leadership is not.  

Find what we all have in common. That’s our humanity. 

Alone we accomplish very little – no matter how bright or talented you are. It’s about what we can do together, to find what binds us together. 

We build a stronger democracy by strengthening our common humanity.  Embrace your fears 

I’ve been asked a lot in the past year: are you afraid? Of course, I’ve had those moments! But CNN trained me to be a conflict reporter, a war zone correspondent. I plan the way in and chart the way out of any field of battle. 

What I’ve learned is that fear spreads and is debilitating. Fear is a luxury.  

If you’re in the middle of chaos, you need to stamp down your fear to have clarity of thought – that’s essential to make the right decision. The way to do that is the 7Ps: “Proper preparation prevents poor performance.”

So I go back to what I learned in school. Fear is your worst enemy. It stops you from doing what you want.  

Whatever you’re most afraid of, touch it. Hold it. Embrace it. Because once you do that, nothing can stop you.  

In my case, dealing with the fear really started last December. That was when Time Magazine named me person of the year – one of the guardians of truth – and I realized I was the only one among us who was then both alive and free. That was the seed. 

Then last April at the launch of the Clooney Foundation’s Trial Watch, for some reason, it became real. I realized I could go to jail – 63 years, in fact, as Amal Clooney pointed out. I was on a panel: Mohamed Fahmy, who was jailed in Egypt for 438 days, was to my right. Jason Rezaian, who was jailed in Iran for 544 days.  

I talked to them. I read their books. Could I endure what they went through? 

What is the worst case scenario I could imagine.  

Then I embraced it. And robbed it of its power.

Prepare for the worst, and hope for the best. 

Embrace your journey

The founders of Rappler – 4 of us, women in our 50s now – well, we joke that we jumped off the cliff. In the Philippines, we’re the only news group whose business is created and controlled by journalists. That’s what we mean by independence. 

So it’s not a surprise that we would continue doing the story, even if – and especially if – it’s bad for business. Yet, despite that, we found a new business model that has our revenues up significantly since last year. We’ll take the risk to do the stories that matter.

The first casualty in our country’s war for truth is exactly how many people have died in our brutal drug war. The police admit they killed more than 6,000 people – rolled back by PDEA right before SONA to 5,600. But human rights groups and the UN estimate that at least 27,000 people were killed from July 2016 until December last year.  

Our impunity series looks at the lives behind these numbers. We fight impunity on two fronts: the Philippine government in extrajudicial killings and the exponential lies on social media – Facebook, which is essentially our internet. 

Facebook is the world’s largest distributor of news, but it ignored the responsibility that comes with that – the gatekeeping powers of journalism, that determines the quality of our democracies around the world. 

I don’t know where any of this will end. Like I said, we jumped off the cliff by standing up for our values, by upholding the mission of journalism, and holding the powerful to account. 

Facebook is our frenemy: Rappler is one of its 3 fact-checking partners in the Philippines, but finding the lies is a game of whack-a-mole. What’s more important is to find the networks of disinformation that spread the lies – and in that you see how all this is connected to geopolitical power play. In our digital forensics, we’ve shown links to the alt-right in Canada, to the alt-right in the US, to Europe, and to Russian disinformation. 

Embrace your journey. And don’t forget to have fun. 

I am daily inspired by our team in Rappler, their spirit, their sense of mission. Despite the threats we face, we are living our ideals now. This is our reality.

What you do today matters.  

You will help define what our society will look like and how our democracy will survive and evolve.  

This is a time of creative destruction. Even as we see what’s being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now.  

Let’s make sure it’s the future we want.  

Get ready for battle. Embrace your values and your humanity. Embrace your fears and embrace the journey. Class of 2019, our hopes are with you. It’s going to be tough but I know you will change the world for the better.",0
22,Maria A. Ressa,"It’s time to ask yourself a question we’ve lived with for years now: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth?
Silence is complicity. 

The blatant abuses of power are now codified into law. It happened in June: a regional trial court’s order changing the period of prescription for libel from 1 year to 12 years; the shutdown of ABS-CBN; and the quick passage of the Anti-Terror Law, under which a critical voice can be named a terrorist, arrested without a warrant, and jailed for up to 24 days. 

The walls are closing in. 

The Philippines is at the precipice. There’s no need to declare martial law because the very processes of democracy have been turned against it. We now live in a time that is “worse than martial law.”

It’s democracy’s death by a thousand cuts. 

The way we at Rappler have survived 4 years of attacks is by: 

1. Shining the light: Name it and demand signatures to these abuses. If we can’t get justice now, we will later. History is on our side. 

2. More hard-hitting journalism: Continue to hold the powerful to account and demand accountability for the people. Of course, the more we do that, the more the full power of the State is turned against us.

3. More innovation: We continue to explore and to build at a time of creative destruction. The Lighthouse, rolling out this week, is our latest experiment and  provides a beacon to safer shores. (Read: How Lighthouse gave us hope)

Hatred, arrogance, and incompetence can only affect you if you let it. The battle begins in our minds. (Read: Rappler ends 2019 with income: A comeback year) 

While I hate being the government’s cautionary tale, I’m not afraid. It made me stronger, solidified the values I believe in, made me draw the line I cannot cross. I will defend the mission of journalism as long as we are a democracy because press freedom is the foundation of every right of every Filipino under our Constitution. My job is to hold up the sky so our journalists can do their work. 

It’s time to ask yourself a question we’ve lived with for years now: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth? I am at peace with my answer.

Everyone who speaks comes under attack on social media, once an enabler, now a tool for oppression. Be prepared for it. Accept this will happen. Social media is now a behavioral modification system. 

We’re demanding accountability as well from the social media platforms, but Lighthouse is also an experiment to see how tech can serve journalism and democracy. Please test it and give us your feedback. 

We can’t do this alone. The impunity of power is brazen, and the battle has now come to every Filipino. (Read: ABS-CBN’s battle is also ours)

We’re not alone. What’s happening in the Philippines is happening globally. In 2018, I laid out 6 action points for the international community. 

Many of you know I spent nearly two decades working outside the Philippines (and recently had a chance to celebrate #CNN40 with my former colleagues). After the June 15 conviction on cyber libel, 60 press freedom organizations around the world came together to help independent media survive in our country. Please consider signing this petition to help me stay out of jail. #JournalismIsNotACrime

When facts are under attack, journalism is activism. Help us #HoldTheLine for our rights. 

Use it or lose it.

23,Maria A. Ressa,"Technology and the pandemic have destroyed our old world and are forcing all of us to actively create a new one. We need to act now.'
Right before America votes, I can’t help but think we are underestimating the impact of technology on our behavior. Behavioral research has long shown that we vote, not based on what we think, but on how we feel. Now imagine that in today’s information ecosystem, which uses neuroscience and predictive analytics to shape our behavior. It’s an extractive business model that allows “fake news” to flourish.

Technology upended journalism, pitting evidence-based news organizations against propaganda, hate speech, and conspiracy theories. Mocha and QAnon won; news lost. That’s what the data shows. 

For about a decade now, technology has been a tsunami, devastating and reshaping industries: music (Apple, Spotify), hotels (Airbnb), transportation (Uber, Grab), and so many more. News organizations lost their gatekeeping roles to technology. That upended the information ecosystem and the distribution of facts. It began to reshape systems of governance and change the geopolitical power balance. 

The new gatekeepers had easy confidence because they cut the world into quantifiable pieces – never mind if it isn’t true, and never mind the consequences.

Move fast, break things
Decades back, I remember asking questions the engineers couldn’t answer about the impact of their choices on society: on personalization; the lies that you can only mute or block; the unintended consequences of “friends of friends” growth.

Personalized recommendations moved from whatever you searched for (that followed you for weeks online) to personalized news feeds. The question I asked then: how can we all have our own different realities? How can news exist in a world like that? If there is no shared public reality, no shared facts, then democracy as we know it is dead.

Lies that you can only mute or block drive me crazy as a journalist. Because they stay and continue to spread: the more salacious, the faster the spread. Emotions, like anger and hate, spread faster too. That alone showed the abdication of responsibility of the new gatekeepers and how little respect they had for the public.
This played right into long-running Russian military tactics which the public saw in Crimea in 2014. Called the firehose of falsehood, Russian propaganda is meant to “entertain, confuse, and overwhelm.” Fast forward a few years, and now you have leaders of democracies, elected with the help of social media, mimicking the same tactics, like President Rodrigo Duterte or President Donald Trump.

How every social media platform uses algorithms recommending friends of friends to grow your network and their user base. Except that one seemingly minor decision, while good for growth, also built filter bubbles and divisiveness – us against them thinking – into the platforms distributing the news and consequently, into our societies.
These 3 practices and many more are part of a god’s eye-view of data, where content is neither good nor evil, and the goal of accumulating data above all feeds the business model of predictive behavioral analysis, the cornerstone of what Shoshana Zuboff calls “surveillance capitalism.”

One root cause
In her groundbreaking book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, this Harvard emeritus professor argues that many of the problems we’re dealing with today – the weaponization of social media, the destruction of data privacy and security, our inability to hold technology platforms to account – are all part of the same problem: the extractive business model which is insidiously manipulating us without our knowledge. 

Working with Shoshana in The Real Facebook Oversight Board, I’ve put words to my experiences, like “radical indifference” – what she calls “an asocial framework” for evaluating data because in this world, all data is equal. The key is volume, not quality. This is the core of “fake news” – strip branding from news organizations, which differentiate between fact and fiction. In this world, lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and further than boring facts. (READ: The Spread of True and False News Online)

So what do we do about this? Our solution in Rappler is 3-fold, aligned with our founding principles: 1. Demand accountability from technology; 2. Protect and grow investigative journalism; and 3. Build community and civil society. (READ: As democracy dies, we build a global future)

We recommend policy frameworks around 4 structural challenges: the transparency of digital platforms; the meta-regulation of content moderation; the platform design and reliability of content; and mixed private and public spaces on closed messaging services. 

We see this as a jump-off point for governments, technology companies, and civil society organizations to begin a much needed public discussion with academics, lawyers, and journalists. 

Technology and the pandemic have destroyed our old world and are forcing all of us to actively create a new one. Defining the problem, bringing in all who need to help solve it – these are only the first steps to make sure we create the world we want.

Regardless of who wins the US elections, we need to act now.",0
24,Maria A. Ressa,"Here are 3 battle fronts for a global response – lessons from the Rappler trenches (and how we’re helping build the future now)'
Silicon Valley’s sins have come home to roost. What happened in countries like the Philippines is now threatening US elections. That’s why about a month before the November 3 vote, I joined Carole Cadwalladr, the British journalist who broke the Cambridge Analytica story, and 22 other industry experts in The Real Facebook Oversight Board – “an emergency intervention aimed at Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook employees.”

Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, kicked off our launch on October 1, 2020. “Our group has come together for one purpose: we demand comprehensive action to ensure that Facebook cannot be weaponized to undermine the vote and with it American democracy,” she said. 

We fear it may be too late. Learn our lessons from the Philippines. It’s strange when you begin to see a dystopian future and count the forks in the roads not taken. And you begin to understand how Cassandra and Sisyphus felt. 

PH: First domino to fall
Democracy is dying. That was what I told Facebook in August 2016; what I repeated 4 months later to journalists at the Google NewsLab in Mountain View; and what I said in every keynote around the world, in every award acceptance speech in the past 4 years. 

Lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and farther than boring facts on social media. A lie told a million times becomes a fact. Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust. Without all 3, democracy as we know it is dead.  The Philippines was the first domino to fall in 2016, followed a month later by Brexit. As Rappler’s business and technology leader, an investigative journalist, and the target of government attacks, I lived through the different strands that led us here. 

After all, Rappler started on Facebook in 2011. We saw its best and are now living through its worst. Frenemies, I call us. Rappler was among the first to see the problem and worked quietly behind the scenes, but we had a responsibility to tell our public how they are being manipulated. In 2016, we did stories about the impunity of two men: Rodrigo Duterte and Mark Zuckerberg. 

Now I am horrified to watch what is happening as Americans prepare to vote, worried about the campaigning already happening on Facebook for our 2022 presidential elections. 

Without facts, how can any nation have integrity of elections? Does free will even exist with constant, insidious manipulation? 

Learn from our experience in the last 4 years. This is how power shapes reality and destroys trust. With the help of Silicon Valley. 

Machine manipulates us
In 2016, Rappler documented and tracked the data and influence operations: the attacks began after we exposed the pro-Duterte propaganda machine seeding attack narratives like “journalist equals criminal.” 

In 2017, that same message bottom up came top down when President Duterte attacked Rappler in his State of the Nation address. A little more than a week later, we received our 1st subpoena.

In 2018, the law was weaponized: 11 complaints and cases were filed against me and Rappler. 

In 2019, I was arrested twice in a 5-week period and forced to post bail 8 times in about 3 months to stay free and keep doing my job. 

In 2020, I was convicted of cyber libel for a story we published 8 years ago, one I didn’t write, edit, or supervise at a time when the law we supposedly violated didn’t even exist. Yet, a former colleague, Rey Santos, Jr, and I can go to jail for up to 6 years. 

Social media is now a behavior modification system, and we are Pavlov’s dogs. 

We input our atomized selves, and for each post, machine learning builds a model of who we are: it knows us better than our family and friends, better than we know ourselves. Then artificial intelligence takes our most vulnerable moment to a message and sells it to the highest bidder. It could be a company or a country. This pattern of insidious manipulation creates its own feedback loop that keeps the machine learning and growing. 

Cheap state-sponsored armies on social media are in at least 70 countries around the world in 2019, according to the Oxford University Computational Research Project. It is a scorched-earth policy for power and money, now part of the global dictator’s playbook.  We fought back and survived the last 4 years by understanding the data and by realizing how social media abdicated responsibility to protect the public sphere. We built our response on the 3 pillars of Rappler: technology, investigative journalism, community. 

Here are 3 battle fronts for a global response – lessons from the Rappler trenches (and how we’re helping build the future now): 

TECHNOLOGY: The world’s largest distributor of news today is Facebook. Yet, it is biased against facts, biased against journalism at a time when journalists are under attack on at least 2 fronts: our credibility and business model. This is the first priority because we have to stop the virus of lies from coming into our information ecosystem.

Here in the Philippines, we’re helping build technology that will protect users and allow a thinking slow process critical to democracy. This is Lighthouse.

Globally, we need policy solutions. This is why former EU Parliament Member Marietje Schaake and I are co-chairing the steering committee of experts from academe, human rights, technology, and law for structural solutions to deal with this “infodemic.” The initiative has received strong support from nearly 50 foreign ministers from the Alliance of Multilateralism, and is expected to release potential structural solutions in November.

JOURNALISM: Facts must survive, and experiments for the distribution of news must continue, even while the cleanup of social media platforms begin. Independent news organizations must survive this crisis of confidence and trust as well as the continuing assault on its advertising business model.

In the Philippines, Rappler is taking the processes we use for our investigative journalism into disinformation networks, and building them into a product. This is part of the reason that despite the attacks, Rappler not only survived, we thrived. Every company is vulnerable to manipulation and attacks in the age of social media, and aside from dashboards, companies need to pivot and learn to combine structured and unstructured data with the latest technology to protect itself and to build community.

When the law is used to attack journalists, the defense is not just local, it’s global, because it links directly to issues of rule of law and international law. Aside from our Filipino lawyers led by Francis Lim at ACCRA and Ted Te at FLAG, Rappler receives pro bono legal support from Covington & Burling, LLC. Our international team is led by human rights lawyers Amal Clooney and Caoilfhionn Gallagher, QC.

Globally, only 0.3% of development funds go to media, and independent news groups will need help to survive the next few years of our information dystopia. This is why there is an effort to get an International Fund for Public Interest Media established: $1 billion annually raised and distributed globally in a transparent manner. Luminate and BBC Media Action’s James Deane are leading this charge; I am part of its Advisory Group.

COMMUNITY/CIVIC ENGAGEMENT: Rappler’s elevator pitch in 2012 is “we build communities of action.” This changes when it becomes dangerous to speak your mind or when communities can’t tell fact from fiction.

In the Philippines, Rappler continues to grow MovePH, our younger communities of action centered around climate change, fact-checking, gender equality, and health. Since 2018, our communities rallied around our values of speaking truth to power and demanding accountability, and our crowdfunding campaign has helped pay our exponential legal fees.

Globally, journalists and press freedom groups around the world have come together to help Rappler shine the light on abuses of power in the Philippines. Nearly 80 civil society organizations are in the #HoldTheLine Coalition, led by 3 amazing women: Courtney Radsch from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ); Julie Posetti from the International Center for Jounalists (ICFJ); and Rebecca Vincent from Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Let me end the way I began with our most effective civic engagement at this moment in time: the Real Facebook Oversight Board – when journalists, academe, civil rights activists, and government officials past and present made clear demands for immediate reforms to help ensure the integrity of facts and elections. Within our first 24 hours, Facebook acted. 

The worst public health crisis in a century and the death of facts enabled the consolidation of power by populist authoritarian leaders. 

It’s clear now that what happens in the Philippines does not stay in the Philippines.

It’s a brave, new world: like the virus, like climate, the battle for truth – for democracy – is global. 

It’s time we start building the future we want, eyes wide open.",0
25,Maria A. Ressa,"Why Lighthouse? Because journalists shine the light, and a lighthouse is a beacon showing travelers the way to safe harbor.'


Embrace your fear: a lesson I learned when I was young, now even more relevant as we enter week 8 of a pandemic lockdown.

That’s what Rappler learned to do after nearly 4 years of government attacks – from the weaponization of social media in 2016 to the 11 politically motivated cases filed against us in 14 months.

For me that meant seriously thinking about jail. Last year, I was arrested twice and detained, forced to post bail 8 times to stay free. Taken cumulatively, Amal Clooney tells me the charges carry over 100 years in prison. As a consolation, Ted Te reminds me the most I need to serve is 40 years.

I am not a criminal. I am a journalist. 

Yet, this is what it takes to be a journalist in the Philippines today. Submit, accept a Damocles’ sword over your head, censor yourself, or be punished. Well, I never did like bullies, and I’ve learned that you define who you are when you’re tested. When we at Rappler look back a decade from now, we will know we did everything we could to protect our democracy.

So I touched my fear and learned to embrace it. Once you do that, you rob it of its power. We at Rappler imagined worst case scenarios, planned, and drilled for them.

Little did we know our planning would prepare our organization for this pandemic. (READ: #CourageON: All in…together!)

Courage comes from action

Left alone against brutal and immense power, we learned that the real battle is in our minds. You lose when you allow fear and panic to rule.

What kept us grounded was our deliberate effort to strengthen our mission of hard-hitting investigative journalism, not just to be reactive or defensive. After you embrace your fear, what’s next?

You build for the future. You imagine the world as it should be, and you create.

Enter Lighthouse, technology in the hands of journalists, trained to protect the public sphere where democracy thrives. (READ: Introducing Lighthouse: Rappler’s new platform)  

The process of imagining the future fueled our hope. We had tried agile development in 2015 but failed. This time with a mindset to learn, we turned to experts, and slowly, this new way of thinking and solving problems began to seep into our organization. We began to work more collaboratively, combining the top-down journalists’ workflow with the atomized bottom-up tech workflow. 

When I was arrested in March last year, I was thinking of new ways to use natural language processing or how we turn words into data – and many more problems that kept my imagination active. It was only peripherally that I realized there were 7 police in the van driving me from the airport to the precinct, and 4 of them were in full swat combat gear. (Really? I thought.) It was a great way to learn anger management.

Why Lighthouse? Because journalists shine the light, and a lighthouse is a beacon showing travelers the way to safe harbor. 

After the lockdown, it’s not a surprise that groups like the TOWNS Foundation, which raised P60 million and delivered its 100,000th PPE, personal protective equipment, to Cebu last week said they were inspired by action. Or Ken Abante and his 50+ volunteers who monitor weekly where the emergency budgets are going. Or MovePH,  its fact-checking initiatives, and Project Lifeline. 

Hope comes from courage. In a pandemic, where does hope come from? From the courage of our frontliners. From the courage of our people. 

As leaders gain more power around the world to deal with the crisis, we need to be vigilant that we don’t permanently give away our hard-earned freedoms. 

Despite the tragic global death toll, we know the worst is yet to come as workers and companies stave off bankruptcy and fight to survive.

It’s fitting that we introduce Lighthouse on World Press Freedom Day. When lies can kill, facts matter. Accountability is more important today than ever. Our lives depend on it so #CourageON!",0
26,Maria A. Ressa,"34-year-old Mocha Uson is a singer-dancer who grew her Facebook page with sex advice and sessions in the bedroom with her all-girl band, the Mocha Girls.  
Their trademark gyrations and near-explicit sexual moves onstage have titillated Filipinos since 2006, and have caused controversy from sex to politics – from a controversial kiss in 2008 after Katy Perry’s hit single was released; to a campaign for the Reproductive Health Bill for sex education and access to contraceptives; to a defense of twerking at political rallies last year.
For the 2016 Philippine presidential elections, Uson campaigned hard for her candidate, then Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, onstage and on her Facebook page, which became one of his campaign’s most effective online political advocacy tool. (Most of the sex-themed videos have been deleted from Facebook, but they remain on YouTube).
Soon after Duterte won, Uson completed her pivot from sexy entertainer to political blogger with an interview with the President-elect. 
She hit the headlines again in August when news leaked that she was going to be a social media consultant at the Bureau of Customs. That didn’t happen largely because of a public outcry that ridiculed her lack of knowledge.
Uson came back and dared her critics to volunteer for government, alleged the first of many conspiracy theories, and strengthened her own attacks against anyone who challenged – or just questioned – President Duterte.  
When Duterte boycotted media for two months, traditional journalists became one of her favorite targets – individually and organizationally. 
Meet the ‘Presstitutes’
One of her often shared memes is “Presstitutes” – a wordplay of press + prostitute, alleging corruption against the Philippines’ top news groups, ABS-CBN, GMA-7, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, and Rappler. 
Other favorite targets are Senator Leila de Lima and Senator Antonio Trillanes IV. 
In every attack, Uson provides no evidence for her ad hominem accusations, but they have been shared so often that many believe they are true. 
“What started out as a lie or half-truth becomes the truth by the time it reaches the general public,” said Vincent Lazatin, Executive Director of the Transparency & Accountability Network, said in a recent panel on Technology and the Public Debate at Rappler’s #HackSociety.
Uson declined our request for an interview.
In a September, 2016 post, she boasted that her Facebook page, which has more than 4 million followers, has surpassed the engagement metrics of top media groups in the Philippines.
That simple action amplifies the network effect and makes their entire collective more powerful. Her Facebook page is the lynchpin of a sophisticated pro-Duterte propaganda machine: in one post, she gives instructions for supporters to follow other Duterte political advocacy pages and supporters as well as anonymous blogs. 
Part 1 of our series, Propaganda war: Weaponizing the internet, focused on the bots – or automated programs – that attacked users based on key words, as well as networks of paid trolls and fake accounts that proliferated in the past year.
“You spoke about how artificial intelligence is here now,” Lazatin said, “but what we’re seeing on the internet is a different kind of AI, which is Artificial Ignorance. The bots, the algorithms and the paid trolls, they are purveyors of Artificial Ignorance.”
Deepening the network effect
This piece looks at how these paid initiatives interact with real people and the impact of Facebook’s algorithms on our democracies.
To deepen the network effect, these bots, fake accounts, and anonymous pages anchor on real people like Uson, whose page helps amplify those accounts’ reach. 
Uson’s page, in return, becomes more powerful because of the increased engagement and invisible web of actions that connect her advocacy page to the others, taking advantage of the actions rewarded by Facebook’s algorithms. 
That means their collective messages reach – and convince  – more people, an effective way to create a social movement. 
Algorithms: Gatekeeper that can’t tell fact from fiction
Facebook’s algorithms, created in a black box, are extremely powerful in shaping reality and creating echo chambers that could be harmful to democracy. 
They cater to our weaknesses, what psychologists call cognitive bias – when we unconsciously gravitate towards those who echo what we believe.
“You’re not seeing everything,” Stephanie Sy, founder of Thinking Machines Data Science, said on the September 26 #HackSociety panel on Technology and the Public Debate. “You’re seeing what Facebook thinks you’re most likely to interact with, and if you interact with something, you’ll see more and more and more of that. And that naturally pushes people into social bubbles that don’t talk to each other and engage with each other.” 
Observers say the echo chamber effect became more pronounced after Instant Articles began last year, putting more news articles alongside updates from your family and friends. 
With 1.7 billion active monthly users worldwide, Facebook is effectively the world’s largest news source, the umbrella organization where nearly all news content flows.  
Its algorithms decide what you see on your feed.
“In many ways, the algorithm has become an editor,” said Dr. Jeffrey Herbst, President and CEO of the Newseum in Washington, D.C. to a September East-West Centre annual gathering of international journalists in New Delhi. That is a loaded phrase for traditional journalists because the editor exercises the gatekeeping function that once gave news groups its power to shape the national narrative. 
Given that Facebook-owned platforms, including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, reach 86% of internet users aged 16 to 64 in 33 countries and that 44% of people across 26 countries say they use it for news, that algorithm determines reality.  
This is more significant, said Herbst, than the emergence of news websites.
One potentially fatal flaw for democracies? The algorithms don’t distinguish fact from fiction. 
This partly explains why Uson’s posts can compete – and, often, beat – news groups. All it takes is for a committed group to organize click farms and trolls, paid or not. Or be outlandishly controversial, quite easy if truth doesn’t matter.
Emotional call-to-action posts in a heated political environment get a lot of engagement, the key metric for social media. 
“Facebook’s goal as a company that seeks to make money for shareholders is to make sure that people stay on its platform as long as possible and read as many posts as possible so that they can sell as many ads as possible at a higher price,” Herbst reminded journalists.
US elections
It’s not just happening in the Philippines. During one of America’s most heated election campaigns, Facebook is where most political discourse is happening. 
On September 9, for example, Facebook promoted in its Trending News section a poll of “doctors” which found Hillary Clinton was “a flaming psychopath.”   
This claim isn’t true, and the group that posted it was behind numerous internet conspiracy theories that had already been debunked.
Shortly before that, Facebook decided to end human oversight over the algorithms after a controversy that conservative articles were not getting enough visibility on the news feed. 
For the social media giant, sometimes it’s damned if you do, damned if you don’t.
“If Facebook were to start limiting what people could say on Facebook, it very easily falls into freedom of speech issues, which are already an issue that they deal with from the other side,” Sy reminded the audience, citing an iconic photo recently censored by Facebook.
The “Napalm Girl” won the Pulitzer Prize in 1972 – a photo of a 9-year old girl whose clothes have been burned away by a napalm attack in Vietnam. (Facebook changed that policy shortly after.) 
“This is just the tip of the iceberg as people across the world understand the power of these platforms and how important they are in determining what people know,” Herbst told international journalists in New Delhi.
Greater impact in emerging democracies
You could argue that Facebook’s impact is even greater in developing economies in Southeast Asia. In countries like Indonesia and Myanmar, Facebook is synonymous with the internet. 
In the Philippines, where the median age of its 100 million people is 23 years old, more than 96% of Filipinos on the internet are on Facebook. 
“People are more confused than enlightened these days, and I can only blame technology,” said Vergel Santos, chairman of the board of the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility at #HackSociety’s panel on Technology and the Public Debate.
The elections also seemed to unleash anger and hatred, made easier on social media. Real issues of marginalization, a wide gap between the rich and the poor, along with many other perceived injustices are ignited by a leader who often threatens violence.
“Everybody’s worry on social media is all of the bullying and all of the bad behavior that comes with it,” UP Communications Professor Clarissa David told me in an interview last May, specifically mentioning sexist and/or misogynistic attacks.
David warned of a possible spiral of silence that is changing the quality of our public discourse: “People who are receiving threats – they’re just going to stop talking … the more silent they are, the louder the other side gets, or seems to get and the more that happens, then you get into this spiral of people deciding to stop engaging.” 
This is partly why Rappler began #NoPlaceForHate – to help prevent the erosion of public discourse and bridge online echo chambers.
Futurists warn of even greater disruption ahead: exponential change to our societies because of technology. 
This, they add, is when humanity becomes even more important. 
“Technology has no morals. Technology has no values.” added Santos, “Technology is too neutral for us to be relying on it alone.”
Tech platform or media?
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had clear views about Facebook’s role when asked last August: “We’re a technology company. We’re not a media company.”
Still, given the central role Facebook is playing today in disseminating news, and the advent of political advocacy pages masquerading as credible sources of information on it, the social media giant may have to evolve to take on the standards and ethics that defined the fourth estate. 
It seems clear the world has new gatekeepers.
“So I think it is incumbent upon these companies to begin to think of themselves as news companies,” Herbst told journalists. “If they don’t take this position now, they will be forced to do so in the future.”
“Facebook is a system,” countered technologist Stephanie Sy, “and systems express moral and ethical behavior through what they incentivise and what behavior they disincentivize … those of us in tech, we also have a responsibility to be part of this discussion and to build systems that incentivize ethics.”",0
27,Maria A. Ressa,"On Saturday, September 3, 2016, the day after the Davao bombing, at least one anonymous Facebook account began to share a March 26, 2016 Rappler story, “Man with bomb nabbed at Davao checkpoint.”
It was quickly picked up and shared by Facebook political advocacy pages for President Rodrigo Duterte. Other websites took the entire dated story and reposted on their sites, like newstrendph.com, which is linked to Duterte News Global (the post has since been taken down). Other Facebook pages, such as Digong Duterte and Duterte Warrior, became active participants in this disinformation campaign. Soon after, these pages manually altered their times of postings. 
This is disinformation because it led readers to think the man with the bomb was captured that day, September 3, when President Duterte declared a state of lawlessness in the aftermath of the bombing. Readers were duped into sharing a lie because the context changed the old headline.
That lie served a dual purpose: it led you to believe the government’s draconian measure was justified and that it acted just in the nick of time; but, it also hit the credibility of a trusted news source – which was the way these pages represented the story once Rappler alerted our community about it. 
It was such an effective campaign that despite the developing news about the Davao bombing, this old story trended number 1 and stayed in the top 10 stories in Rappler for more than 48 hours. 
Take another example: a post by Peter Tiu Lavina, Duterte’s campaign spokesman, who attacked critics of the government’s “war on drugs” with his statement about a 9-year-old girl who was raped and murdered.
The photo was taken in Brazil, not the Philippines. 
These are only some of the many disinformation campaigns we’ve seen since the election period: social media campaigns meant to shape public opinion, tear down reputations, and cripple traditional media institutions. 
This strategy of “death by a thousand cuts” uses the strength of the internet and exploits the algorithms that power social media to sow confusion and doubt. 
This series takes apart this new phenomenon triggered by technology and information’s exponential growth:
Part 1 looks at the paid propaganda taking over social media;
Part 2 takes apart the new information ecosystem, its impact on human behavior, and how its weaknesses could be exploited; and, 
Part 3 focuses on 26 fake accounts on Facebook, which together extend to a network that influences at least 3 million other accounts. 
Weaponizing the internet 
It’s a strategy of “death by a thousand cuts” – a chipping away at facts, using half-truths that fabricate an alternative reality by merging the power of bots and fake accounts on social media to manipulate real people. 
A bot is a program written to give an automated response to posts on social media, creating the perception that there’s a tidal wave of public opinion. Since this is machine-driven, it can manufacture thousands of posts per minute.
A fake account is a manufactured online identity, sometimes known as a troll depending on the account’s behavior. Not all trolls are part of a paid propaganda campaign, but for now let’s focus on the paid initiatives, which can pay a troll up to P100,000/month. 
Often, dozens of these fake accounts work together along with anonymous pages, strengthening each other’s reach for Facebook’s algorithms. These networks can work with or without bots. 
A small group of 3 operators, a source tells Rappler, can earn as much as P5 million a month. 
Because they often disregard truth and manipulate emotions, these networks easily game Facebook’s algorithm. 
In the Philippines and around the world, political advocacy pages, made specifically for Facebook, are cleverly positioned and engineered to take over your news feed.
That allows these propaganda accounts to create a social movement that is widening the cracks in Philippine society by exploiting economic, regional, and political divides. 
It unleashed a flood of anger against Duterte critics that has created a chilling effect.
“It was specifically brought into sharp relief during these past elections, where the amount of hatred and vitriol on the internet was just intolerable,” Vince Lazatin, Executive Director of Transparency & Accountability Network, said during a recent panel on Technology and the Public Debate. “It silenced people into submission. The trolls have found a way to weaponize the internet.”
It’s not clear whether these accounts used for the campaign are working with official government channels today.
What is clear is they share the same key message: a fanatic defense of Duterte, who’s portrayed as the father of the nation deserving the support of all Filipinos.
This possible consolidation of the Duterte campaign machinery with state communications channels is dangerous.
We only need to look to China, which fakes nearly 450 million social media comments a year, according to the Washington Post. 
This is the first time this sophisticated political propaganda machinery has been used in the Philippines.
FUD – Fear, uncertainty, doubt 
Yet, this isn’t the first time social media has been used to manipulate public opinion here.
The first groups to actively use the power of social media, including its dark side tactics, were corporations and their allies. They used a strategy popularized in the computer industry in the US known as FUD – which stands for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt – a disinformation strategy that spreads negative or false information to fuel fear. 
FUD is commonly used in sales, marketing, public relations – and now – politics and propaganda. 
As early as October 5, 2014, Rappler alerted the public about how interest groups are mobilizing fictitious social media resources at scale to disrupt online conversations.
Here’s an example of a black ops campaign on Twitter.
It used a combination of bots and fake accounts to essentially take over and shut down telco promotional campaign #SmartFreeInternet.
In a nutshell, if you use the hashtag, it signals a bot to message your account –  to sow fear and doubt to trigger anger – a classic FUD campaign. That’s coupled with fake accounts which continue the campaign. (The greenish-blue line are bots, which attacked at such a high frequency that it effectively shut down the red Smart campaign.)
Here’s a map of the conversation, laying bare a familiar communist strategy: “surround the city from the countryside” –  effectively shutting out the Smart Twitter account from its targeted millenials. 
First social media elections 
Social media came of age for politics during the election campaign for the May 2016 elections.
Long before Duterte decided to run, we had long noticed that Davao City had one of the most engaged social media community in the Philippines. 
Now we would see humans augmented by machines in both engagement and online polls.
The first time we saw Twitter bots in politics seemed to happen by accident. 
Four days after he declared his presidency, from midnight to 2am on November 25, 2015, more than 30,000 tweets mentioning Rodrigo Duterte were posted, at times reaching more than 700 tweets per minute. That’s more than the number of tweets posted when he declared he would run, and more than all the tweets about any presidential candidate over the previous 29 days. 
Thinking Machines did an analysis of the campaign using bots and discovered that politics had intersected with entertainment. An examination of the bot-like Twitter accounts showed their timelines full of KathNiel. (Read: KathNiel, Twitter bots, polls: Quality, not just buzz) 
What about online surveys which are used to gauge public opinion? Machines can influence that as well.
In December, 2015, Rappler investigated technical manipulation of our online survey, and discovered that 99% of votes from Russia, Korea and China were for Mar Roxas (although there was a small number of these manufactured votes for Duterte as well). Deleting the fake votes changed the winner from Roxas to Duterte. (Read: Who gamed the Rappler election poll?)
Duterte social media campaign
Social media was a crucial factor in electing this president.
Former activist and ex-ABS-CBN sales chief Nic Gabunada headed Duterte’s social media efforts. He told Rappler in a May 31 interview that he built the network with P10 million and up to 500 volunteers, who tapped their own networks. 
They were organized into 4 main groups: OFWs or overseas Filipino workers, Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. He said each volunteer handled between 300 to 6,000 members, but that the largest group had 800,000 members. (Read: Duterte’s P10Msocial media campaign: Organic, volunteer-drive)
It was a decentralized campaign: each group created its own content, but the campaign narrative and key daily messages were centrally determined and cascaded for execution. Gabunada emphasized these posts were done by real people, not bots.
Analysts agreed that the 2016 elections were the most engaged in Philippine history, but they also pointed out that the period also highlighted some of the angriest and vicious political discourse that’s transforming our democracy. 
By March, two students at UP Los Baños had been threatened by an online mob. 
In a scene reminiscent of the Boston bombing witch hunt, Duterte supporters tracked cell phone numbers and harassed and threatened the students they perceived to be disrespectful of Duterte.  
At one point, they created a Facebook page demanding death for the student it named. (READ: #AnimatED: Online mob creates social media wasteland)
Within 48 hours, the Duterte camp asked his supporters to “take the moral high ground” online. (READ: Duterte to supporters: Be civil, intelligent, decent, compassionate)
In April, a young woman who posted she was campaigning against Duterte was deluged with threats and harassment. (READ: ‘Sana ma-rape ka’: Netizens bully anti-Duterte voter)
Shortly before election day, she tested laws governing cyberbullying by filing 34 complaints in court. 
Boycott & attack media
The day after he won, Duterte called for healing and his campaign team supported and trended his message using the hashtag #HealingStartsNow.
It didn’t last long.
The soon-to-be president made numerous controversial statements in late night press conferences, including what could be seen as a justification for journalist killings and his wolf-whistle of a GMA7 reporter.
By the beginning of June, Duterte announced he would boycott media and channeled all statements and press conferences through state television network, PTV, and RTVM.
He didn’t break that boycott of private media until August 1. 
In those two months, the campaign machinery pivoted to propaganda and threats, first attacking ABS-CBN, then Inquirer (largely because of its Kill List keeping track of extrajudicial killings).
GMA7 and Rappler took the hot seat after Duterte wolf-whistled at a GMA7 reporter, Mariz Umali, at a press conference, and Rappler reporter Pia Ranada-Robles questioned him on it.
The social media attacks were vicious and personal. They built on their campaign messages, continuing to rail against the Liberal Party and building fear for a “yellow army.” 
Anonymous and fake accounts rallied real people to create and spread memes with simple messages that contain a grain of truth, the most efficient for FUD:
“Bias” – that these media groups are biased against Duterte.
“Bayaran” –  that journalists are paid and corrupt. 
“Oligarchs” – that journalists work for vested interests.
“Clickbait” – that media groups are commercial interests so they use clickbait headlines for cash. 
When the leader of a nation refuses direct access to journalists, controls the narrative top down through established state groups, and is echoed bottom up by social media initiatives, it creates a chilling effect on 2 fronts:
Access becomes a personal favor for reporters, removing a professional environment and creating a more feudal landscape. Reporters, if they want access, think twice about questioning power.
Critical posts on social media are immediately attacked, forcing “normal” people to leave the conversation. Many close their Facebook accounts, leaving the field open for more sophisticated manipulation in an increasingly growing echo chamber.
On September 19, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines called on the government to investigate social media attacks against journalists Gretchen Malalad and Jamela Alindogan-Caudron. 
On September 22, President Duterte asked his supporters to stop threatening journalists.
But his statement has done little to stem the propaganda attacks.
Over the weekend, Reuters reporters Manny Mogato and Karen Lema were targeted after reporting President Duterte’s remarks about Hitler. 
Shape perception, rewrite history
These all impact public perception. Fallacious reasoning, leaps in logic, poisoning the well – these are only some of the propaganda techniques that have helped shift public opinion on key issues. 
Take for example what was once a prevailing acceptance of human rights and the idea of “innocent until proven guilty.” Today there seems to be a wide acceptance of murder, especially of drug pushers, and any attempt to question that is portrayed as part of a conspiracy theory.
It’s part of the reason many silently accept that in just 11 weeks, 3,546 people have died in the government’s “war on drugs.” (These figures from the PNP were later revised to 3,145 on September 14, 2016).
After all, when someone criticizes the police or government on Facebook, immediate attacks are posted, including “someone should rape your daughter,” “how many people were raped by pushers,” “why not talk about those killed by drugs,” “mayaman kasi kayo,” and many more. 
Could it also be used to rewrite history?
That was the charge against the Official Gazette on the 99th birthday of Ferdinand Marcos, who held power for nearly 21 years. 
Using a quote that subtly links Marcos to Duterte’s campaign for change, the caption’s revisions sparked outrage, especially after a conflict of interest surfaced: it was posted by a former Marcos staff member. 
So what can be done?
Understanding what’s happening is a first step. 
Working together to separate fact from fiction is another step. 
Regardless of your political leaning, social media is a powerful tool, and if abused, the first casualty is the truth – which will have a direct impact on the quality of Philippine democracy.",0
28,Maria A. Ressa,"In 2016, the Abu Sayyaf's senior ideological leader pledged allegiance to ISIS, and videos and statements about PH are spread by ISIS central propaganda groups
Although the government declared a state of lawlessness, authorities have released little concrete information about the explosion that killed at least 14 people in Davao City’s night market Friday, September 2, 2016.
On Saturday morning, September 3, radio station DZMM said the Abu Sayyaf claimed responsibility for the blast in an interview with a self-proclaimed spokesman for Al Harakatul Al Islamiyah, the formal name used by the Abu Sayyaf.
By the afternoon, however, allegedly that same man, Muammar Askali, alias Abu Ramie, told the Inquirer that it was carried out by an ally he called Daulat Ul Islamiya.
“They are doing this to sympathise (with) our group, and we are sending a message to President Rodrigo Duterte that all the Daulat throughout the country is not afraid of him,” said Askali.
So who could be behind the explosion? To answer this question, let’s look at the facts we know and provide some context. 
Islamic Community
First, the name Daulat Ul Islamiyah is a slight variation of Jemaah Islamiyah, which literally means “Islamic Community.” From the late 90s to 2005, Jemaah Islamiyah acted like al-Qaeda’s arm in Southeast Asia, gaining global notoriety with the Bali bombings in 2002, which killed more than 200 people. 
The Abu Sayyaf was part of Jemaah Islamiyah and carried out a spate of bombings in the Philippines, including Southeast Asia’s worst maritime terrorist attack in 2004. It was blacklisted as a terrorist organization by numerous countries, including the Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the US for bombings, kidnappings and beheadings. 
During its heyday, authorities said the Abu Sayyaf had up to 1,200 members which after more than a decade’s presence of US troops, went down to as low as 240. Filipino officials say they estimate about 400 members today. 
President Rodrigo Duterte ordered this crackdown after the beheading of a Filipino too poor to pay ransom. That follows 2 high-profile beheadings of Canadians held for ransom. 
According to Rappler’s sources, there are about 8,000 troops chasing the Abu Sayyaf today in Jolo, Sulu – or about 20 soldiers for every Abu Sayyaf member, but the ground war is never this easy in this complicated terrain.
Abu Sayyaf and ISIS
It’s important to recognize that the most senior ideological leader of the Abu Sayyaf, Isnilon Hapilon, has pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State or ISIS. At least 4 other groups in the Philippines have done the same and named Hapilon as their emir, one of the final steps for ISIS to declare a wilayat or province. (READ: Experts warn PH: Don’t underestimate ISIS)
Initial intelligence reports confirmed Sunday by the police said the explosion was caused by an IED, an improvised explosive device made from a mortar round.
The Sulu-based Abu Sayyaf tend to use ammonium nitrate for its explosives. A mortar round IED is closer to the signature bombs of two Abu Sayyaf allies who have pledged allegiance to ISIS: Ansar al-Khalifa, also known as AKP or Ansar Khalifa Philippines, based in southern Mindanao; and the Maute group in central Mindanao, also known as Daulah Islamiyah.
Both these groups evolved significantly since the time they worked with Jemaah Islamiyah. 
AKP and Indonesia
AKP is headed by Mohammad Jafar Maguid, more commonly known as Commander Tokboy, allegedly a former commander of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) 105th Base Command. (READ: Two ISIS-allied militants killed in Philippines)
Tokboy was trained by key JI leaders, including Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, the high profile target of the Mamasapano tragedy that derailed the peace talks. (READ: Marwan’s ties that bind: From family to global terrorism)
AKP under Tokboy has a direct link to Indonesian groups, especially MIT, Mujihidin Indonesia Timur, led by an Indonesian who trained in the Philippines, Santoso. 
Indonesian intelligence sources said they were investigating the flow of explosive materials from the Philippines to Indonesia after the January 14, 2016 Jakarta bombings.
In July, 2016, Indonesian forces killed Santoso, dubbed the “symbolic heart” of the Indonesian jihadi movement. Some warned that his comrades may join the Abu Sayyaf. (READ: After death of Indonesia’s top terrorist, comrades ‘may join Abu Sayyaf’)
AKP pledged allegiance to ISIS in a YouTube video in 2015, and is largely believed by experts to be one of the groups behind another video threatening the November, 2015 APEC Summit in Manila and later globally distributed by ISIS propaganda sites. (READ: ISIS’ global ambitions and plans for Southeast Asia)
ISIS claims Maute jail break
The Maute group, which also calls itself Daulah Islamiyah, has carried out bombings and kidnappings. It carries the black flag and insignia of ISIS, and has been very active this year.
From February 20 to March 1, 2016, the group, which pledged allegiance to ISIS, attacked a military camp and established 3 major strongholds, essentially displacing nearly 30,000 people until troops regained control of the town of Butig in Lanao del Sur. During that time, the group beheaded a soldier. It took 10 days for the military to regain control.
On April 21, 2016, a Facebook account posted two photos showing the Maute group beheading two of six sawmill workers kidnapped from Butig. They released four of the hostages six days after their kidnapping, but chose to behead the two because they were allegedly military informants.
The two beheaded were forced to wear orange jumpsuits, much like ISIS public executions. The post says, “Two spies beheaded by the Lions of IS ranao.” 
Finally, just last week on August 29, an ISIS propaganda arm, the Amaq news agency, claimed that ISIS was behind a prison raid at the Lanao del Sur jail in Marawi.
“Fighters from Islamic State stormed a prison in Marawi City in Philippines on Saturday, south of the country, and were able to free thirty prisoners and seizing weapons,” wrote Amaq news agency.
“Thirty fighters carried out the attack and were able to release 30 detainees, including fighters from the Islamic State and their wives. The fighters of the attack and all the detainees, who were freed, arrived to safe places without injuries,” it stated.
Those arrested were caught with homemade mortars, which they told interrogators, were to be used in bombing missions in Iligan and Cagayan de Oro.
In its report, the BBC said no shots were fired during the prison break, and that a military source said “the men had been allowed to escape.”
A military report obtained by Rappler states, “recruits of the Maute group were largely drawn from the MILF ranks, particularly disgruntled factions prompted by the failures in the Bangsamoro Basic Law or close associates and blood relatives.” 
Evolving landscape
These are only some of the possible groups behind the Davao bombing. 
What happened to the terrorist networks in the Philippines is exactly what happened to al-Qaeda globally: authorities gouged out their top and middle rank leadership, but the ideology and cells continued to burrow and evolve. 
Jemaah Islamiyah was an umbrella group that hijacked homegrown networks. Although the MILF turned away from global terrorism in 2005, other groups like the Abu Sayyaf, the Rajah Solaiman Movement, continued to push a terrorist agenda.  
There are still other groups like the al-Khobar, another MILF extremist splinter group that turned to criminal activities like bus bombings in 2011. (Read: Philippines’ evolving terrorism threat) 
What has happened to them today? 
A clear evolution is the clarion call of the Islamic State, which has its own Southeast Asian battallion in Syria called Khatibah Nusantara. (READ: ISIS and Jakarta attacks: What we need to know)
Part of the problem is that the strategy of the Aquino administration largely centered on denial. This is despite the June, 2016 call of a Malaysian jihadist in Syria, Mohd Rafi Udin, for ISIS followers to go to the Philippines, making it “the nucleus” in Southeast Asia. (READ: ISIS to followers in SEAsia: ‘Go to the Philippines‘)

29,Maria A. Ressa,"Imagine a future where robots do the majority of the work. People work at most 10 hours a week, but they still get basic income, what governments call monthly pay given unconditionally. It’s an experiment that will be tested in Kenya later this year and in the Netherlands, Finland, and Canada in 2017. 
Imagine a world rid of all genetic disorders – and doctors using principles of genetic engineering to go a step further, changing the color of a person’s eyes, height, strength, and many more at will.
“We’re in control,” technologist Rob Nail tells me in his Silicon Valley office. “Our capability with CRISPR technology – we’re designing it. We’re here. That’s what we’re doing today.”
“We’re torn in a lot of different directions right now at the highest levels of ethics and morality,” he adds. “How do we make these decisions that are going to fundamentally change humanity? Who gets to make them? Who should be at the conversation?”
What it means to be human
43-year-old Rob Nail is excited about the future he sees now: where people can design human beings; and where he says the exponential growth of technology translates to virtually free energy, which impacts transportation, the price of food, access to education, and all we need to live in what he calls “a future of abundance.”
“That’s a world of abundance where everyone has equal access to not just the basics, but like middle and upper class basics,” he explains. “Then what do you do? Because at that point, robots are making food. Education is online. What do we do?”
“Meaning and purpose then,” I answer.
“Exactly!” he agrees. “That starts to be really important, and how we think about humanity at that point starts to be a really exciting and an interesting thing. Very scary to most people – incredibly exciting for me. Because I think that allows us to talk about what it means to be human.”
“What is really the purpose of humanity? And for me, where I go with that is I think the future of humanity is to explore the big questions: Why are we here? What else is there? How does this thing work? How do we connect? And creativity, right? That’s it.”
The tech hipster CEO and associate founder of Singularity University says it’s time to start public discussions not just about the disruptive effects of technology but also about the infinite possibilities ahead.
“One of the biggest things I think is missing in the world is an articulation of this kind of future  – one that is exciting that we can live into,” he tells me, making fun of science fiction films with doomsday scenarios and machines taking over the world.
“Who is talking about and spending time helping figure out the model for that future that we can live in?” he asks. “That’s a great transition. One of my greatest fears and my sense of urgency is that we have a tremendous amount of work to do over the next 20 to 30 years to get through this transition period to create a world of abundance.”
The future of jobs
He has first-hand experience in dealing with robots and artificial intelligence: one of the companies Nail co-founded, Velocity11, built automation equipment and robotics for cancer research and drug discovery before he sold the company and exited in 2007.
“I personally have a deep concern about the future of work and the future of jobs,” he says. “The technological disruption of jobs is a very real thing, and it’s always happened. And it will always happen. It’s nothing new. What’s new today is the pace: it’s accelerating!”
He lays out the arguments why in about 20 years, he says robots will take over most of our jobs. 
“Every physical task,” he adds, “will be taken over by robots.”
He’s not the only one predicting that. Earlier this year, President Barack Obama warned Congress that robots will take over jobs that pay less than $20 an hour, placing about 62% of US jobs at risk. 
“That doesn’t mean that there’s not going to be new jobs,” he says. “There will be, but when you say these jobs are going to be wiped out by technology, people would say, ‘Whoa! Let’s stop technology.’ Well, let’s figure out how to adapt and figure out what those new jobs are and make them happen sooner.”
Merging machines and humans
Robots are highly dependent on A.I. or artificial intelligence. Funding in A.I. startups increased more than 4 times to $681 million in 2015, from $145 million in 2011, according to market research firm CB Insights. It estimates an increase of up to 76% this year, bringing new investments to $1.2 billion in 2016.
Still many naysayers point out that there have been false starts, with a boom in the 1980s in A.I. investments that largely failed and is now known as the “A.I. Winter”.
In terms of consumer technology, many are familiar with Apple’s Siri (even though some pointed out it needed to be adapted to Filipino English). 
A year and a half ago, Amazon announced the launch of a voice-activated speaker connected to the internet called Echo. Using this, you get a virtual assistant that can control your home devices connected to it, get you the latest news, or play your favorite music. All you have to do is ask Alexa.  
Now Google is set to release its competitor, Google Home, which can tap into what some call the world’s largest A.I. – Google, fed with billions of data points from different consumer touch points. 
How far this can go is hotly debated within the United States. Some, like Nail and his colleagues, believe it’s only a matter of time before machines become smarter than humans – a term they call the singularity. Others believe machines should always be subservient to humans, but the amount of data available now is staggering to imagine.
Leapfrog development
What happens in other parts of the world, especially developing countries like the Philippines? 
Nail points out that technology gives emerging economies a chance to leapfrog development. 
“One of the most exciting things about exponential technologies is that they are rapidly democratized,” says Nail. “So the tools to use CRISPR? Any country, any research lab at any university anywhere around the world has the capability to use it and do new things with it…It’s for emerging markets to decide – well, what do we want to be? Do we want to be the world’s leader in education or in genetic engineering or maybe in manufacturing? Because you can turn that on today with very swift policy decisions and investments.”
So what does the Philippines want to craft for the future?
Understanding technology and choosing the path ahead – that’s the challenge to policy makers and industry today. (To be concluded)",0
30,Maria A. Ressa,"Senator Poe, Sec Mar, VP Binay can offer something better for the country, but they can't offer something different. Not real change,' says Cayetano
It was a gorgeous Sunday sunset that splashed vibrant colors against the stage, where organizers say, as many as 100,000 people waited for up to 7 hours for Davao Mayor Rody Duterte, the not-so-surprise candidate whose outspoken bluntness promises to enliven presidential campaigns in the next 5 months.
Among the early arrivals was Duterte’s pick for vice president, 45-year-old Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, whose doggedness and persistence made the partnership with Duterte possible.
“Senator Poe, Sec Mar, VP Binay can offer something better for the country,” Cayetano replied when I asked him why he believes Duterte is the right leader for the Philippines. “But they can’t offer something different. Not real change.”
Wearing a red Philippine flag collared shirt and black jeans, Cayetano found us a table behind the stage and gamely spoke into my cellphone, doing a live video conversation in the midst of the frenetic energy around the stage.
“Duterte stands out among them because he will really change things,” he emphasized. “Kumbaga nung panahon namin na Walkman pa lang, everyone’s just offering a new feature: may mic, may instant…you can change side A, side B…but Duterte is the iPhone. Duterte’s the iPad. He would change how things are done.”
(If during our time, when it was just the Walkman, everyone’s just offering a new feature: a mic, with instant…you can change side A, side B…but Duterte is the iPhone. Duterte’s the iPad. He would change how things are done.)
Cayetano’s national experience in politics – two terms as senator (which end in 2019) and the secretary-general of Nacionalista Party in 2010, fielding former senator Manny Villar for president – give some depth to what may be Duterte’s hastily organized national campaign.
In the past few months, many candidates visited Duterte in Davao, including the ruling party’s presidential bet Mar Roxas, and until recently, Senator Bongbong Marcos. He also has a substantial track record but is burdened by the legacy of his father, former president Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for 21 years until he was ousted in a people power revolt in 1986.
Duterte calls Ferdinand Marcos one of the Philippines’ greatest leaders and says he wants his strength of will, minus the taint of corruption. (READ: Duterte’s end game for leadership)
“Mayor Duterte is a man with a plan – he is very strategic,” said Cayetano comparing Duterte to other politicians who, he said, pale in comparison. Like asking Filipinos to stop a practice like smoking: “any other politician” would get “maybe 10%” to stop. He explained how one man can trigger massive change.
“When Mayor Duterte says stop, 50% will stop,” Cayetano continued. “The other 50% that don’t stop, he will really bring the battle to them – to their doorsteps, to their homes, to their workplaces. And when he does this, it has a ripple effect, like a domino. Dominoes can knock off many more dominoes, and it can start a chain reaction.”
It’s a leadership style that’s worked for the mayor of Davao City, who’s never lost an election since 1988. The question is, can it translate to a national stage, the country’s top post?
“I’ve studied a lot of his proposals,” said Cayetano. “This is what’s amazing. It sounds doable from a man like him, but you also keep asking yourself how. The more time you sit with him, especially in private, then he starts telling you how he’ll actually do it. You realize that it’s really that simple: that it’s really just political will.”
Sunday night’s concert, MAD – Musicians and Artists for Duterte, lasted past midnight because Duterte said his plane was late. He makes clear his personal life and his policies are intertwined, throwing out details most candidates try to hide about his wives and girlfriends. He promises transparency, and he delivers. (READ: Duterte: Yes, I’m a womanizer)
This is in stark contrast to Cayetano’s devotion to his wife Lani, the mayor of Taguig. They also took different positions on the Bangsamoro Basic Law for peace in Mindanao, with Duterte supporting it and Cayetano helping turn public opinion against it. (READ: HIGHLIGHTS: House hearing on Mamasapano clash, April 8)
“I think my advocacies are consistent with Mayor Duterte,” said Cayetano. “Iba lang yung aming paraan. (We just have different methods.) It’s like he’s the guy in the ring. I’m the guy in the court. So I think we complement each other.”
Cayetano and Duterte, a former fiscal – and both lawyers – are in their honeymoon period, but it will be interesting to watch how they work together in the coming months.
“Every time I go home after a long night with him – because he finishes his night at 1, 2 or 3 am, you know – I’m excited the next day or even that night. I text my staff and say I want this researched because Mayor wants this done. The other day he was talking about contractualization, and I haven’t heard any politician…mainstream politician…those who are really there saying, ‘I will stop it.’ But after a 5-minute discussion with Mayor Duterte, I think we found a legal formula to make this happen.”
“Legal formula,” I interrupted. “So that’s the question: in order to make change happen, he’s proposing extra-legal measures, right?” [READ: Duterte, his 6 contradictions and planned dictatorship)
“Well, extra-legal now, but Duterte can change the legal framework,” Cayetano quickly replied. “For example, telling the police not to shoot under any circumstances and telling them na pag lumaban, barilin mo (that if they resist, shoot) are two different things, but the latter is still legal.”
“I think you articulated it well,” Cayetano said. “There are a lot of things about Duterte that seem to conflict but are actually not in conflict. In one sense, the group of policemen that he works with, he trusts very much, but in another sense, he knows you have to reform the whole police organization.”
On Sunday night, Duterte spoke candidly onstage, at one point saying, “Fuck human rights.” Shamelessly unapologetic, he said file the cases against him and prove them in court. After all, he is a man with a mission.
At the very least, the Duterte-Cayetano campaign will force each Filipino voter to discuss what people actually do – like have mistresses, commit violent crimes, or yearn for strong-man rule – instead of staying on the surface of wishful thinking about societal behavioral norms.
“It just came to me that unconditionally, I would support him whether or not he gets me as his vice president,” said Cayetano the night before PDP-Laban endorsed their tandem. “He has the political will. He will change the way things are done.”",0
31,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"At the IMF, countries are represented by their central banks in the International Monetary and Financial Committee while the finance or development ministers constitute the joint Development Committee to advise both the World Bank and the IMF mostly on issues related to economic development in emerging and developing countries. In particular, governance issues of central banks have often been the focus of lively debates at the IMF. 

Just last week, the Fund’s Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department Tobias Adrian guested at the Bank of Thailand’s (BoT) Annual Retreat. His remarks focused on central bank independence and why it’s needed and how to protect it.

Adrian’s appearance at the BoT could not have been more auspicious in the face of a running conflict between Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s efforts “to exert more control over the country’s central bank after repeatedly clashing with the monetary authority on economic policy,” as reported by Bloomberg two weeks ago.

No less than Srettha himself who admitted seeking advice from former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra on economic policy. And what kind of advice would Thaksin give to Srettha on monetary policy, for instance, other than what he demanded from the BoT during his time? Thaksin’s populist streak pushed him to pressure the central bank to adjust monetary policy and prioritize economic growth over the central bank’s mandate to manage inflation.

What is bad for Thailand is that its new leadership right from the start in September 2023 announced that it was aiming to accelerate economic recovery and ease taxpayers’ financial burdens. During the same month, the BoT decided to jack up its policy rate for the 8th straight time to 2.5 percent, the highest in a decade. This tightening mode was sustained at its November 2023 meeting.

Srettha, who is concurrently finance minister, openly requested a rate cut from the start of 2024 and as Nikkei Asia reported, even summoned BoT Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput to his office on Jan. 10. He even disclosed to the media that he suggested to the central bank head to have more frequent coffee even at the BoT headquarters. Nobody can deny it was an open attempt by the head of the Thai government to meddle with the central bank.

But Sethaput who graduated from Yale was not new in the public service. He was more than equipped and experienced to stand his ground that easing monetary policy when inflation remains an issue is just wrong. The BoT kept the rate unchanged at its Feb. 7 meeting.

Recognizing the independence of the BoT did not prevent Srettha from suggesting that “it should not ignore people’s suffering.” The problem with the Thai Prime Minister is that he’s arguing from nothing. He wanted a rate cut because he believed the Thai economy is in crisis. BoT’s view is contrary to Srettha’s: “domestic demand continues to expand…key factors hindering growth outlook to be external and structural.” It’s pointless to reduce interest rates because growth is emasculated by falling exports due to China’s own economic slowdown and low labor productivity. 

The BoT is also concerned that should interest rates are reduced, the Thai baht is likely to weaken. If they start easing before the US Fed, that action could lead to investors dropping Thai assets in favor of foreign assets, and trigger baht selling in a big way. That is inflationary. Srettha does not seem to cover this ground.

Another concern of the BoT is its pride as an independent central bank, something that not all central banks may be steadfast to defend at all costs. Beyond pride, the BoT is correct in its assessment that if the financial market begins to perceive it as being soft on preserving its independence, such could lead to what they call “double baht-selling.” That is injurious to the Thai economy, that is suicide for the central bank. 

Clearly the Thai government appears focused narrowly on short-term stimulus measures because its eyes are on the next election. On the other hand, the central bank and its veteran staff would always be the gatekeepers of long-term stability of the economy. There is bound to be a delineation between politics and economic vision. 

Thus, Adrian’s remarks are timely and they must be inspiring for those in the trenches at the BoT. He had a number of very precious messages to the central bankers in Bangkok.

First, he talked about setting the stage. Central banks face tremendous pressure from politics because as monetary policy had to be tightened due to the post-pandemic inflation, economies slowed down, unemployment rose and fiscal position worsened. Their balance sheets bloated by the amount of support they extended to their governments. The financial institutions that they regulate are now demanding that they should also live up to the same standards of governance, risk management and transparency that central banks require of them.

Second, independence remains necessary even as some sectors called for greater oversight of central banks. Who supervises central banks? Empirical evidence is clear that higher central bank independence is associated with lower inflation.

Adrian quoted the US Council of Economic Advisers’ blog about the US Fed as a classic example of the supreme value of independence. Even as actual consumer price inflation had exceeded the target two percent, inflation expectation has broadly been steady at two percent because the US Fed is perceived to be independent and therefore its monetary policy remains credible and effective in combatting inflation.

What are the metrics of an independent central bank?

In his remarks, Adrian indicated that together with his co-authors, Lev Menand of Columbia University and Ashraf Khan of the IMF, they collaborated to produce a new global index for central bank independence. Ten metrics have been developed aimed at helping central banks and policy makers strengthen central bank independence. (To be concluded next week).",0
32,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Certainly it was exhilarating news last Sunday, that decision of Fitch Ratings to affirm the Philippines’ investment grade rating at BBB, a notch above the minimum investment grade. Equally significant is the stable outlook that Fitch maintained for the country.


Such a rating action of one of the three major credit rating agencies rewards us for all the efforts of government, business and the rest of the civil society to address the debilitating economic scarring of the pandemic a few years ago and to come to grips with the thinning fiscal space. We did not do badly in achieving respectable economic growth, bringing down inflation and mopping up slippages in public finance.


The marching order  is to deliver on this recent favorable credit rating.


Fitch has a list of the Philippines’ macro strengths as well as structural weaknesses. Keeping the BBB label and stable outlook  means Fitch recognizes our strong medium-term growth. The significance of such an outlook hinges on our ability to reduce government debt to GDP ratio in the next few years. And for us, the imperative of securing cheap and reliable energy, good governance, strong connectivity throughout the islands and optimizing our demographic advantage.


What sets us back? 


We have a low GDP per capita which signals sustained demand for resources to fund various social amelioration projects away from infrastructure and to us, debt servicing ability. Fitch also argues that governance standards are weaker than those of its BBB peers even as it agrees World Bank indicators of good governance could be overdoing it.


On growth prospects, Fitch shares the World Bank’s cautious optimism with its 5.8-percent GDP forecast for 2024. It was correct for Fitch to have attributed last year’s slowdown to the growth-boosting, pandemic-mitigating public expenditure and high inflation. Spending on the pandemic is dissipating this year while high price pressure restrained private consumption and investment. While El Niño could be bad for agriculture, power and water supply as it was, La Niña could also limit business activities in the second half of 2024. 


The challenge to our policymakers? 


Fitch expects this medium-term expectation to be supported by what it calls “large” investment in infra and reforms to foster trade and investment, including renewed interest in public-private partnership (PPP). 


A good plank to this positive growth outlook is gradual fiscal consolidation. Fiscal sustainability ensures continued infrastructure and social services that all should result in stronger business activities. Higher fiscal deficit is not per se bad, as long as growth is secured and a fiscal consolidation plan is in place. Well, the Philippines is into it, and the remaining task is to pursue it, and pursue it well.
Fitch in this latest watch believes “there is some risk of a further fiscal slippage given the government’s continued focus on economic growth and the approach of mid-term elections in May 2025.” Fitch implicitly hopes that the focus on tax administration will produce good results.


We have time and again pointed out that keeping public spending at 60 percent of GDP, or below, secures our overall economic well-being. This is basically the same message of Fitch to the authorities. If this is delivered, then Fitch is justified in saying that our debt profile is stable. 


On external payments position, Fitch zeroed in on the current account deficit which is indicative of an emerging country’s reliance on foreign saving. Fitch says it is narrowing, and its expectation is that it will drop to below 2.0 percent of GDP by next year from last year’s 2.6 percent. This is very achievable with the continuing growth of the economy and the harnessing of indigenous, renewable power sources. 


Fitch also considered the country’s external financing as favorable because it comes from long-term borrowing and foreign direct investment (FDI). The latest good news is that our gross international reserves (GIR) hit a historic high of $105 billion in May. This should further convince the credit rating agency of the country’s strong ability to repay its external obligations.


For obvious reason, Fitch recognized that inflation pressures are moderating. While upside risks continue to threaten price stability, the BSP’s initial success in inflation management was apparent with the sustained retreat of core inflation since 2023 up to May 2024. Contrary to some views, the BSP’s hawkish monetary policy is yielding good results. The challenge is to intensify on those non-monetary measures including stronger supply chains and lower but time-varying tariff duties on imported commodities.


Fitch also commended the BSP’s inflation-targeting framework and flexible exchange-rate regime. They are sound, and they are credible. The government’s use of BSP resources during the pandemic was controlled and shortly reversed while the calls for generalized fuel subsidies were justifiably resisted.   


Finally, Fitch observed that the Marcos Jr. administration “has continued to advance structural economic reforms with the overarching aim of catalyzing private investment.” Much space for growth has been gained with the improvements introduced in the PPP law, Foreign Investment Act and Public Service Act. If this commitment to sustain game-changing economic reforms is upheld, we have a good chance of going back to the old growth path prior to the pandemic of 2020.


Fitch rating action also showed some rating sensitivities. In the first place, a stable outlook means stable, neither an upgrade nor a downgrade is forthcoming. But the stable outlook could also turn positive if strong adherence to macroeconomic sustainability is maintained, fiscal and debt metrics show constant improvements relative to GDP and finally, governance standards are firmed up. 


While this recent affirmation from Fitch is good news, the challenge is without doubt to deliver on those macroeconomic concerns that could bring about better future for our country and people. 


There is an enchanting whole new world of difference when we are rated A or A-. It means we have attained that level of growth that job opportunities are more plentiful and lower inflation promotes higher purchasing power for our people. ",0
33,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"It was the American political scientist Hans Morgenthau who proposed that the word “equilibrium” is equivalent to “balance.” Nothing is more important than ensuring the stability of the whole while preserving the independence of its components. In its global application, we have an equilibrium when nations are not only independent, but they are also entitled to exist. 

From its perspective, China believes regional stability may be preserved despite the assertion of its territorial claims over parts of the South China Sea that belong to and are within the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. That is not just bullying, it is also an outright violation of the UN Charter that prohibits “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”

Ironically, the UN Security Council can play double standard, or engage in doublespeak, by a unilateral veto of any intervention even against their own belligerent action. We saw this type of violations by the United States’ invasion of Iraq, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its war against Ukraine, and of course, China’s hostile presence in the South China Sea. National sovereignty was without question violated without any obvious consequence. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China can seem to get away with its territorial adventurism. 

As proof, China dismissed the 2016 arbitral ruling in favor of the Philippines “null and void.” In fact, China continues to deal with maritime visitors in the South China Sea with lasers and water cannons. It has standing regulation authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain “trespassers” to its claimed territories including the traditional fishing ground of Filipino fishermen. 

What is pathetic is China’s argument that it is the Philippines that is compromising regional stability by involving another great power. China badly needs shadows and mirrors to realize it is arguing on technicality. When a big power like China can afford to ignore rules-based arbitral ruling and insist on its own definition of what falls under its own territorial jurisdiction, the only way to prevent territorial adventurism is precisely to establish international alliances. Without such a counterweight, China could very well secure a wholesale title over practically the whole of South China Sea.

China could afford to throw its weight around the world because since 1978 when it started to open up to the world, its GDP growth has averaged more than nine percent every year. Over 800 million Chinese people have literally escaped absolute poverty. China is now the largest exporter in the world, a global factory no less. 

At the conclusion of China’s Article IV consultation a week ago, First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath could not have been clearer in describing China’s economic development over the past few decades as remarkable.

With a country of over 1.4 billion people, China is the world’s second biggest market. Its land area covers five time zones and occupies borders with some 14 countries. The world’s third largest country in land area, China is now the second largest economy in nominal output and the largest economy based on purchasing power parity. China is credited with having grown its nominal gross output from just over $150 billion in 1978 to around$18 trillion in 2023. 

It's no puzzle then if China should nurture some ambition to challenge the US’ global leadership. In naval power, China between 2014 and 2018 alone succeeded in launching more vessels than the total number of ships in the German, Indian, Spanish and British navies combined, as Foreign Policy wrote in 2020. 

Xi Jinping’s announcement of a “new era” in 2017 meant that China must “take center stage in the world.” Establishing regional hegemony is a crucial step and this implies that China must assert itself as the dominant player in the Western Pacific. We now see China exerting strong influence in security and economic affairs in the region and neutralizing US alliances. The South China Sea is an excellent showcase of its growing weight in the region and its aspiration in the larger global stage.

But there is one thing that could go wrong for China.

It is their ability to manage the strong headwinds of aging population, weaker investment, and geo-economic fragmentation. These big picture issues translate into slow growth, weak exports and currency, and a deepening property sector crisis. Governance remains an existential issue. With growth dynamics strongly entrenched in China with its extensive and deepening capital markets, China should be able to overcome these risks.

But if China fails the economic test, its global posture may be considered to be nothing more than a paper tiger.

But there is another thing that could go well for China.

It is the US and its western allies themselves. Recently, former IMF Economic Counsellor Raghuram Rajan correctly observed that “the Western alliance itself is fraying.” Self-interest is driving the weakening consensus on economic direction. The US itself, while demanding openness in trade and finance, is doing so based on its own definition of openness. Doublespeak can be easily discerned and it could undermine the US and its Western allies including those in the Asia Pacific.

If this shift in economic power is to be reflected in the IMF and World Bank governance through an appropriate adjustment in country quotas, China may ultimately end up with the largest quota and of course, more extensive influence. Rajan pointed out that under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the Fund’s headquarters may have to move from Washington, DC to Beijing. 

If the Fund persists in its tradition of reforming itself incrementally through modest adjustment in quotas without fundamental changes in governance and management structure, then Beijing would have another platform to pursue its global ambition.

Whether this is going to lead to better political equilibrium will be an open question for some years to come.",0
34,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Some TikToks say it all. To afford a rare McLaren 620R, worth at least $280,000 or more than ₱16 million, one should get used to living in a farm and running a piggery business. Prepare to live a simple life, grow with your father’s workers and yes, do homeschooling. After a few years, branded jewelry, bags, and dresses worth millions of pesos would complete your ensemble as you ride your own chopper after winning a local election in a small town north of Luzon.

Many have been monitoring the Senate hearing and from all the public declarations of Mayor Alice Guo of Bamban, Tarlac, that is her story. That is her life. Change the details here and there like the McLaren that she said she just borrowed, but keep the details about the simple farm life of her childhood with no personal recollection of her playmates and the mother Amelia Leal that she never saw, and that’s Mayor Guo’s 38 years. 

To be sure, there were more questions than answers that our senators elicited from the Bamban mayor.

Why she could not establish her origin escapes us. She could not recall who raised her up as a youngster,or who taught her at home except a certain Teacher Rubilyn. Her birth was registered only when she was 17, but there was no record of where she was actually born because hospital records are non-existent. Her residential address at best was fictitious. While she claimed her family had embroidery business in Valenzuela, a quick search revealed no such business was ever conducted there. She indicated a home address in Valenzuela but no less than Senator Sherwin Gatchalian belied it. Someone he knew owned the place. Most damning, both the couple whom she claimed as her parents have no existing birth and marriage records in the Philippine Statistics Authority. Whatever questions were thrown at her, Mayor Guo invariably insisted she grew up in the farm, and she lived a simple life.

As Senator Loren Legarda quipped, “para namang may script.”

But the script, although it looks expansive, was rather weak and incoherent because there remained many loose ends in Mayor Guo’s narrative.  Securities and Exchange Commission records show she’s one of the incorporators holding substantial shareholdings in at least 11 companies since 2010. Allegedly born in July 1986, that means she was only about 24 years old when she amassed so much to have organized such a business network. She acquired a helicopter in 2019 at age 33 for an air taxi business but gave it up when the prospects did not reportedly prove promising. She also engaged in car dealership which she allegedly used to justify her ownership of 16 vehicles even as they remained under her name.

Her Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) showed very rapid increase in her net worth. The script failed to provide the mayor with the answer to the questions of the senators on how she accumulated higher net worth in such a short time. 

Let’s be real, we can do a thousand iterations of the piggery or embroidery businesses, car dealership or similar business activities but no way could they yield a combined income to allow Mayor Guo to afford expensive jewelry and much less to finance the purchase of a chopper even for business that ultimately failed, and the 10 hectares of land on which POGO operators built a whole hub of gambling complex.

Before she ran for mayor of Bamban, Guo in September 2020 applied for a license to operate Hongsheng Gaming Technology, Inc. Before she was elected mayor, she claimed she divested from the business. When the same technology company was raided, it had rebranded itself as Zun Yuan Technology. During that raid, a Ford Expedition belonging to Guo was found. Electric bills of the Zun Yuan premises totalling some ₱15 million were charged to Guo herself and that covered the period as recent as September 2023 to February 2024.

Perhaps the script failed to anticipate the discovery of the so-called illegal activities at the POGO hub in Bamban in March 2024. What is suspicious here is that Zun Yuan was located in the Baofu compound just behind the Bamban municipal hall where the mayor holds office. Baofu Land Development that leased the compound to Zun Yuan is owned by no other than the mayor herself. The complex consists of 32 building structures with a reported tunnel structure as an escape route. 

Why the mayor did not even bother to check the extensive POGO operations in her own property is a puzzle to many. The raid established that illegal activities such as human trafficking and illegal detention were done in the mayor’s property. Official reports showed that there are torture chambers in the complex, panic rooms, vaults containing millions of pesos and dollars with confiscated passports of foreign employees. The Bamban POGO was reported doing other business outside its license. Cyber fraud operations were suspected to have been committed.

What is left unsaid, and perhaps it was supposed to be in the subtext of the players rather than in the script, is the motivation of Guo in running for mayor of a second-class municipality where the POGO operations had been in full blast. 

If we go by costs and benefits, it was argued in the Senate that the social and economic costs due to POGO including crimes, tax evasion, foregone foreign direct investments and tourism at some ₱143.3 billion far outweigh the benefits estimated at ₱134.86 billion for allowing POGO. Net cost to the country is more than ₱8.4 billion. 

That is the paradox of POGO but somebody else wrote the script for us.",0
35,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Bloomberg and online news last Tuesday reported a closing rate of ₱58.27 to a dollar, nearly the same level it did on Nov. 8, 2022, and the worst in 18 months. BSP Governor Eli Remolona emailed media  to explain that “the peso weakened beyond ₱58 to the US dollar today, in line with other currencies in the region. The dollar continued to strengthen as the Federal Reserve signaled delay in cutting interest rates.” 

The governor captured the immediate dynamics of the peso’s weakness but there are more to it, and some could be traced back to the BSP itself.

First of all, no one can fault the US central bank for suggesting that rates may remain higher for longer. It is correct to stay tight because the US economy is robust and resilient, humming with the stock market, while domestic inflation has so far proved stickier at around three percent against the two percent target. 

But we read a different story from the broadsheets last Friday.

The BSP announced that it may start cutting interest rates as early as August for a total of 50 basis points (bps), as “recent inflation uptick was not as bad as expected.” To many observers and media reporters, such a statement sounded less hawkish even after the Monetary Board kept the policy rate steady at 6.5 percent.

Such a statement is not exactly in synch with the BSP press statement issued after the Board meeting the day before. Its penultimate paragraph could not be more than hawkish: “The Monetary Board deems it appropriate to ensure sufficiently tight monetary policy settings until inflation settles firmly within the target range. A restrictive policy stance will also help keep inflation expectations anchored amid a possible buildup in upside risks to future inflation.” 

As to its institutional commitment, the BSP press statement could not have been more steadfast in reiterating that it “remains ready to adjust its monetary policy settings as necessary, in keeping with its primary mandate to safeguard price stability.”

But to say that the BSP “still has room to cut rates before the US Federal Reserve,” up to a possible 50 bps may confirm that the MB meeting was “dovish.” The market’s demand for US dollar soared and we ended up the other day with the peso’s weakest showing in 18 months. 

It is not impossible for some to speculate that monetary policy is less worried about inflation than the prospects of growth. After all, the Development Budget Coordination Committee recently announced lower growth targets of 6 percent-7 percent for 2024 and 6.5 percent-7.5 percent for 2025. 

And domestic inflation seems to be about to break through the inflationary spiral of March 2022-November 2023 with the less-than-expected inflation of 3.8 percent in April 2024. If the May 2024 inflation should turn out less than 4.0 percent, then one can safely say price pressures are losing steam, and the issue boils down to how much stronger are the upside risks the BSP identified during last week’s policy meeting.

As proof, the BSP announced risk-adjusted inflation forecasts of 3.8 percent for 2024 and 3.7 percent for 2025 from 4.0 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. With these solid forecasts, the BSP could have dwelt more on the favorable dynamics of inflation and the impending success of hitting the target after two years. Issuing instead a forward guidance of an August easing when the US Fed looks keen on staying higher for longer is bad timing. After all, a risk-adjusted forecast of 3.8 percent for this year is not exactly “benign.” In our previous lingo at the Board in times past, it is “manageable.” 

If the risks identified as upside risks amplify themselves beyond programmed magnitude, the upper end of the target could easily be breached. 

And here’s the rub: telegraphing to the market the likelihood of an easier monetary policy in the next few months was enough to upset the foreign exchange (FX) market. Therefore, the crash of the peso beyond ₱58 is not exactly unexpected. Moreover, the situation turned for the worse when the BSP admitted that it was intervening less. Unless the BSP once again affirms its strong commitment to checking market volatility and ensuring order in the FX market, the breach in the ₱58 line in the sand could be further extended.

If the peso further weakens over a prolonged period, the exchange rate pass through could begin to kick in, and inflationary tendencies may resurge. What is “manageable” risk-adjusted forecasts for 2024 and 2025 could be easily beaten. Nobody fancies this. 

Yesterday’s report about the country’s April balance of payments deficit of $639 million from March’s surplus of $1.2 billion does not inspire a stable peso. The shortfall derives from the government’s massive debt repayments. Cash remittances from our overseas workers are at best anemic. And the deficit is not true only for the month of April; the first four months of the year also yielded a deficit. 

It would not also help the peso and inflation if at this time that monetary policy should remain cautious against a tight US Fed to talk about a possible reduction in the required reserve ratio (RRR) from 9.5 percent to a possible five percent. That will release hundreds of billions of pesos into the monetary stream. True, a high RRR is distortionary of financial intermediation. But its expansionary effects cannot be discounted at this time when aiming for a lower inflation is still imperative.

On the other hand, the market may wish to read the emerging scenario with more care and give the BSP more credit that it is now seeing an early victory against inflation. Our monetary authorities may just be too excited to share to the business community what it intends to do once inflation is firmly under control, reduce policy rate and then by lowering the RRR, infuse the market with more money. ",0
36,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Last week, some think tanks observed that the monetary authorities are becoming less hawkish based on their policy statement, that references to keep monetary policy sufficiently tight “is completely gone” and that keeping it steady is emerging to be the norm. Economists of some multinational banks with local branches even went as far as saying the US Fed could start loosening as early as May with some 150 basis points. The BSP is believed to be calibrating its future move with the US Fed.

One of them chose to be overly aggressive as to suggest a specific timeline of June this year “even if inflation stays above four percent next quarter.” The BSP could move ahead and unhinge its policy rate from 6.5 percent provided the month-on-month inflation remains disinflationary and its path is expected to drop below four percent.

We believe that the BSP admits that the emerging inflation dynamics is showing some improvements and it continues to sound hawkish. It remains critical for the BSP to assure the market that its focus on price stability is unfazed. Inflation expectations, once unmoored, could make even supply shocks more entrenched.

No inflation targeting central bank would be so careless to start easing policy rate if inflation stays above its target for a quarter. It’s risky. Such a misbehaving quarter could outweigh the benign inflation readings for the rest of the year. Disinflation is hard to achieve if one quarter shows out-of-target reading. Some analysts must be banking on base effects.

But there are basic reasons to be risk-averse for the rest of the year.

For one, El Niño based on weather studies appears to be on the strong side through the second quarter of 2024. Some weather experts believe there could be a transition to more neutral conditions sometime in the middle of the second quarter but such transition is found to be quite abrupt. This means the initial report by the Agriculture Department on crop destruction could be understated. With diminished rainfall, delayed planting season, and crop failure, lower harvest is likely to affect at least 23 provinces in Luzon and one in the Visayas. With a stronger El Niño, some 65 provinces may be hit. The other side of El Niño is La Niña which could succeed it with strong flooding and tropical storms. This could probably happen starting the third quarter 2024. 

Food continues to be dominant in the weighting pattern in the consumer basket. With El Niño, therefore, inflation could likely gain some momentum both during its incidence, and after. We need to monitor how the strong dry spell condition could be eased by the government’s mitigation measures.

The other upside risk to inflation is the proposed ₱100 wage increase recently passed by the Philippine Senate. While one can very well echo our economic managers and private employers’ concern about the price effects of such an adjustment, it is always good to see the other side, too. It was only recently that the minimum wage was increased after so many years that it was pegged at ₱537 a day. As of January 2024, the current ₱610 a day minimum wage is only ₱502 a day in real terms. Some statistics show that nationwide, some 2.4 million workers are paid the minimum, but over eight million earn below that. 

Assuming away any political motivation behind their move, the senators’ proposal simply attempts to help minimum wage workers cope with the last few years of high inflation in the country. A catch-up, this could be inflationary unless one, firms do not adjust their share of the profit to absorb the cost of the adjustment and two, such an adjustment is not supported by any productivity gains. Firms could very well use any of their savings from the implementation of CREATE (Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises) Act’s incentives system.

Department of Finance’s estimates put the government’s foregone taxes in favor of corporates at around ₱476.8 billion for five years. Firms may have the choice to use these savings to fund the additional adjustment in workers’ income. The impact on job creation may also be addressed by what the Labor Department announcement in terms of various measures to assist small business to keep their workers’ jobs. There are also exclusions to this mandated wage.

Since this is a new development, the BSP may have failed to reflect this in its matrix of upside risks, other than the previous wage adjustments approved in various regions in the Philippines for implementation starting this year.

Dubai crude oil prices have also been acting up recently on account of the latest hostilities in the Red Sea and continuing conflict in Ukraine. However, if the proposed ceasefire could come through next week, this could pull down prices of fuel and energy. However, as the market expects oil supply to be rather tight in 2024 and 2025 given the continuing shortfall among the OPEC countries, oil prices could reverse into an uptrend. Oil production is also likely to slow down with the voluntary cuts among the OPEC members. If the announced meeting in March resolves to continue with the voluntary cuts beyond quarter 1, global and domestic oil prices could push up inflation even closer to the risk-adjusted BSP inflation forecasts. If second round effects are triggered, a breach is also possible.

How we wish we are wrong, but the BSP itself admits that the previous tightening moves would have negative carry-over effects on the country’s economic growth in 2024. It links back to inflation in that lower growth could also fuel some supply shocks. 

In contrast, while ending up the year below the minimum target of 6.0 percent, the Philippine economy nevertheless proved and could be more resilient. This scenario mirrors the global prospects of a little higher growth than last year, falling inflation and job markets holding up, as the IMF’s Kristalina Georgieva recently put it. 

The bigger challenges should be recognized this early. Yes, inflation may be cooling, and we hope we are proven wrong with our reservations because of the upside risks. But our National Government has many miles to go in rebuilding buffers against future shocks, reducing fiscal deficit and slashing public debt. 

How we also wish that after the restrictive economic provisions in the 1987 Constitution are liberalized, we should be getting more slices of foreign investment pie. It’s good the NEDA recognizes that more complementary spade work is crucial in easing the cost of doing business, promoting good governance and rolling out more infrastructure.",0
37,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"In one of the episodes of Karen Davila’s ANC talk show about three weeks ago, former NEDA Director General and Socio-Economic Planning Secretary “Mareng” Winnie Monsod clarified a few important points critical to the issue of Charter Change. First, she questioned whether the remaining economic sectors of educational institutions, mass media and advertising sectors, if liberalized, could truly herd foreign direct investments (FDI) into the Philippines in a big way. Second, while she agreed that the 1987 Philippine Constitution could stand some amendments, the timing could be more appropriate. This is not the time to do it because in the first place, she argued, no hard evidence or research has been presented that liberalizing a few remaining economic sectors could spark enormous interest in the country’s investment prospects.

To support her arguments, she cited in particular the work of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) Hazel Parcon-Santos to show that there are essential ingredients to the positive decision of foreign direct investors to invest here other than allowing full foreign ownership of business and liberalizing the terms of engagement. We know Hazel because she worked with us on various research projects that she handled with excellence at the BSP’s Center for Monetary and Financial Policy.

She has two major publications, both of which dwelt on the issue of foreign direct investment. The first one was published in 2014, “Trade and Investment in the Philippines.” This paper is basically a review of the literature. She discussed the evolution of the country’s trade policy and its impact on the various sectors of the economy, stressing the positive impact of trade liberalization on productivity, economic growth, and on the environment and efficiency but with mixed results on income distribution and poverty as well as on the labor market.

On foreign direct investment, Hazel recognized that developing countries in general are short of both capital and access to international financial markets. Such countries attract foreign capital by offering various types of incentives in order to achieve capital accumulation. She pointed out the constitutional restrictions in certain industries in the Philippines — mass media, small-scale mining, private security agencies and the manufacture of firecrackers and pyrotechnic devices, among others, including domestic air transport, public utilities and pawnshop operation. Of course, with the reforms after the 1990s, in many of these sectors foreign participation has been mostly decontrolled.

What is more interesting is the one whole section she devoted on the determinants of FDI. Tracing through the literature, she identified the various factors that attracted FDI: general policy of openness, strong macroeconomic fundamentals, economic recovery and political stability. 

There are also negative factors including militant labor unions, inadequate technical and vocational skills, high cost of unskilled labor compared to Indonesia, Vietnam and China, weak labor productivity, poor infrastructure and lack of competitive support industries. 

She also cited various works that found that there are three categories of government policies that affect FDI in general. The first category includes investments in infrastructure and industrial power supply, as well as wage and productivity. The second category includes tax structure and administration as well as fiscal incentives and FDI restrictions and limitations. And the third category includes membership in bilateral investment treaties and economic partnerships. All these promote FDIs.

An early study by the Asian Development Bank (2005) in four manufacturing sectors, Hazel quoted, showed that macroeconomic stability, corruption, electricity, tax rates and economic policy uncertainty are the top five concerns of FDI proponents. Another study found that fiscal incentives are not significant and that public resources should instead be deployed in productivity-enhancing goods like education and infrastructure.

The second paper of Hazel was done in 2021 and resurrected on Sept. 26, 2023 in the form of a research blog in collaboration with other BSP staff namely, Maria Rica Amador and Marie Edelweiss Romarate. The 2021 paper casts its query in a competitive mould, that the five members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam would have to compete for FDIs by improving their investment environment as they aspire to recover from the health pandemic. Using Nikolaas Tinbergen’s gravity model (1962), they found that FDIs respond to various factors, both economic and non-economic: sovereign credit ratings, corporate tax rates and FDI restrictions, quality of human capital, and public governance. 

One important aspect of the paper is captured by a chart in the study showing that the Philippines in 1997 was the third most restrictive among the ASEAN 5, after Vietnam and Malaysia. In 2019, Vietnam was the most open of the five, with the Philippines coming in last. But all ASEAN five between 1997 and 2019 brought down many of their regulatory restrictions on FDIs.

In their review of the empirical literature, the BSP research staff extracted the various factors driving FDIs such as locational advantages of host countries, market size, cost and quality of labor, economic openness, and quality of governance and business regulations.

Focusing on the ASEAN-5, the initial observation was that “as of end-2019, Thailand has the highest inward FDI stock from the 15 source countries, while the Philippines has the lowest.” At various desirable levels of FDI determinants, the Philippines was particularly characterized as the economy with the highest corporate tax rate and FDI equity restrictiveness index; highest perception of corruption, the lowest rule of law index, overall ease of doing business and road quality index.

One key empirical result in the ASEAN-5 shows that “the overall FDI restrictiveness index is statistically insignificant for all investors when macroeconomic stability, governance, ease of doing business, and quality of infrastructure are accounted for.” The BSP researchers also concluded that FDIs have different sensitivities to different FDI restrictions, they cannot be generalized as if liberalizing one aspect could produce wholesale migration of foreign capital. For instance, Asian FDIs do not seem to be prevented from investing in the ASEAN-5 by restrictions on employment and approval mechanisms.

To strengthen their finding on FDIs restrictions, they used instead alternative specifications of economic openness, like capital account openness, instead of FDI restrictiveness index. Based on the so-called Chinn-Ito index, this proved statistically insignificant, too. However, joining bilateral trade treaties and economic partnership is positive for FDIs and statistically significant. 

The concluding paragraph of Parcon, Amador and Romarate should not be surprising: “…there is no factor that can single-handedly attract FDIs.” Both economic and non-economic factors are important, that breaking the barriers in tax and FDI restrictions will not be sufficient if the investment climate is rather weak. Critical, holistic policies have to be constantly enhanced on efficient business regulations, quality of public governance and infrastructure and the availability of appropriate human capital.",0
38,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Business activities are judged based on, among other key indicators, the strength of both market support and resistance. Fundamental factors could drive the dynamics in the local bourse like the uptick in inflation in February 2024 that pulled down the bellwether index by as low as 113 points last Tuesday. Before the weekend, the market had recovered by 1.53 percent or 104.87 points to close at 6,942.21!

Indeed, the stock market reacts, and many times disproportionately wild, to some unexpected news. 

This is the main point of Robert J. Shiller who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013, together with Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen, for his pathbreaking work on why widespread overvaluation of investors could happen in the context of what he called “irrational exuberance.” Financial markets are subject to “bubbles” or rapid increases in asset prices that are unsustainable. Over time, changes in stock and bond prices do occur in predictable patterns that reflect investors irrational exuberance over market prospects.

Ironically, he shared the prize with Fama who championed the view that markets are efficient. In receiving the award, Shiller admitted he was part of that generation that subscribed to market efficiency. In his subsequent works, Shiller proved “that the apparently impressive evidence for market efficiency was not unimpeachable.” Markets can fail.

In the third edition of Shiller’s best-selling book, Irrational Exuberance (2015), he clarified that those episodes of irrationality are not unique to the US. They could also happen elsewhere. In Chapter 8, “New Eras and Bubbles Around the World,” the Nobel laureate examined the largest stock market movements around the world before 2000. His theory: “…prices in these countries have tended to reverse after making exceptionally large increases, as one would expect if bubbles were common among them.”

In his account of the 25 largest recent one-year real stock price index increases in Table 8.1, the Philippines was top with 683.4 percentage increase over the period Dec. 1985 – Dec. 1986. Taiwan and Venezuela were far second and third. In Table 8.2, Shiller showed the 25 largest recent one-year real stock price decreases. The Philippines was seventh with nearly 62 percent decline over the period October 1973–October 1974. 

We see from Table 8.3 the largest five-year real stock price increases with the Philippines on top with 1,253.2 percent rise over the period Nov. 1984 – Nov. 1989. Finally, in Table 8.4 which listed the 25 largest recent five-year real stock price index decreases, the Philippine stock market appeared three times with percentage declines of as much as 83 percent during various periods. A few Asian stock markets were also in the list but they appeared only once.

The Philippines’ narrative was not lost in him: “The biggest one-year real stock market increase of all, in the Philippines from December 1985 – December 1986, was an amazing 683.4 percent. The biggest five-year real price change, of 1,253 percent also occurred in the Philippines.” Index declines were not as large.

Based on our own recall of history, those enormous adjustments in stock prices were preceded by periods of uncertainty and great distrust of the country’s prospects. They included the 1969 reelection of Marcos Sr. followed by the devaluation of the peso, and the period of martial law until it was nominally lifted in 1981. The second oil crisis also happened during this period in 1979. The lifting of martial law in 1981 did not mitigate the economic conditions such that Marcos was forced to call for a snap election. In 1983, former Senator Ninoy Aquino was assassinated that sent shock waves throughout the economy. A debt moratorium was announced in October 1983. Growth declined, inflation was over 50 percent, and interest rates were as high. The stock market had collapsed.

Shiller characterized the dynamics during this period as negative bubbles. Price- earnings ratios were dismally down such that the succeeding gains may be considered significant reversals of such historic lows. Top stocks like PLDT and San Miguel were selling at two to three times their earnings with steep discount to their asset values.

On the other hand, the largest gain was recorded during the 1986 EDSA Revolution that Shiller described as leading to the collapse of the dictatorship, Marcos fleeing the Philippines and a new government installed. “Once the new government was in place, the country developed renewed hope; a “new era” certainly seemed at hand.” Contrary to many expectations, Shiller observed that the gains were not reversed in the next five years. Based on stock market behavior, confidence was rather intact during the three years after EDSA.

In fact, the biggest equities’ gains of 1,253.2 percent took place during the five-year period spanning the country’s 1984 debt moratorium, the 1986 EDSA and subsequent installation of a new government despite several attempted coup d’état. 

We are wiser today to learn that despite all the succeeding economic challenges of a bankrupt public treasury, high fiscal deficit and widening public debt, strategic policy and structural reforms were undertaken over the next two decades to establish a more resilient and robust growth path that resulted in uninterrupted positive growth from 1999 through 2019.

The equities market could have been exuberant per Shiller, partly because the fundamentals have something rational to show for some of those years.",0
39,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"During the Spanish Inquisition between 1478 and 1834, religious activities were above the law. The Inquisition even transformed into a judicial institution in order to combat what the royal throne considered heresy in Spain. Under the Grand Inquisitor Tomás de Torquemada, torture and confiscation were used to terrorize his victims, for indeed during his time, judicial procedure was by design ruthless. This is the dark side of “faith.”

Preacher Apollo Quiboloy of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) is the subject of a Senate probe on alleged “large-scale human trafficking, rape, sexual abuse, violence and child abuse.” What Senator Risa Hontiveros, chair of the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality intends to establish is the truth behind the accusations of Quiboloy’s former associates. Any material insight from the probe is supposed to help improve criminal justice involving children, women and other vulnerable sectors in Philippine society.
For Quiboloy’s alleged offenses are not limited in the Philippines.

In the United States, Quiboloy made it to the most wanted list of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation for “94 overt acts.” Since Nov. 10, 2021, an arrest order has been issued by the US District Court in Sta. Ana, California for Quiboloy and eight of his associates. Trial was supposed to have been conducted in March 2023 but it was moved to Nov. 2024 to give all parties more time to prepare.
The Senate investigation to be sure is far from a religious inquisition.
 
But Quiboloy opted to snub the invitation thrice. He declined these invitations because to him, the Senate investigation “is not in aid of legislation but is tantamount to usurpation of judicial functions beyond the powers of the Senate.” 

But what Quiboloy displayed is nothing less than an arrogant disrespect of the Philippine Senate. He acted as if he is above the law. 
Contrary to Quiboloy’s claim, the Senate Committee is authorized under Section 17 of the Senate rules governing the conduct of committee investigations. Hontiveros’ committee was tasked by the Philippine Senate to look into allegations of various violations involving the preacher and his global church. The committee’s authority includes the power to summon witnesses, take their testimony and issue subpoenas. Under Section 18, such witnesses, if they defy the Senate, can be declared in contempt, arrested and detained. 

Quiboloy’s camp also claimed that the Senate resolution calling for the probe is “brazenly incriminatory.” Quiboloy argued that his refusal “is not a sign of disrespect to the honorable Senate nor a disregard of its powers and functions but is purely based on the fact that the criminal accusations against him can only be legitimately settled before the competent courts.”

As a preacher of the Gospel, Quiboloy could have taken the moral high ground. Romans 13, which Quiboloy must have preached in his own church, mandates everyone to submit himself to the governing authorities for, as it underscores, “there is no authority except that which God has established.” He could have modestly honored the Senate’s invitation, attended the hearing and explained his side of the story. 

Even Jesus did not resist arrest even as He chose to be silent during his own mock trial. Of course, Pilate never saw a threat in Him when He said “My kingdom is not of this world.” (John 18:36)
Definitely, it is not for a man of the cloth to question whether the Senate is the proper body to investigate his case which has so far put the Philippines in a bad light. Time Magazine covered his indictment for various crimes as an evangelist from the Philippines. The Senate itself does not pretend to establish his guilt or innocence; it simply aims to look for ways to help improve criminal justice by legislation.

Unfortunately, Quiboloy also declined the invitation of the House of Representatives that is now probing into his involvement with SMNI whose broadcast franchise was suspended over alleged violations.
Quiboloy’s refusal to attend congressional investigations must be the product of his own discernment that he would be granted his wishes for the proper courts to try his cases.  Indeed, the Justice Department on March 4 ordered the filing of charges for child abuse and qualified human trafficking against him in Davao and Pasig. Secretary Crispin Remulla also reversed a June 2020 resolution by Davao prosecutors dismissing the complaint against Quiboloy. They were instead ordered to file appropriate charges against the Davao preacher. 

As we write this column, the Senate has been reported to have ordered the arrest and detention of Quiboloy for contempt. The Senate’s Sergeant-at-Arms will keep Quiboloy until his appearance at the Senate floor.

But we wish Senate President Migs Zubiri did not have to clarify his signature was only ministerial, clarifying he had to defer to Hontiveros’ request for the arrest order because Quiboloy’s explanations were not satisfactory, and that backchanneling was resorted to. One wonders after the Senate investigation, what comes next?

Another angle is also disturbing. Secretary Remulla’s explanation that the filing of charges “effectively prevents Quiboloy from getting extradited to another country, particularly the United States, where he faces multiple charges of sex abuse and labor trafficking.” Is this good or bad? 

The dark side of “faith” is something to reckon with.",0
40,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"We are going through the Lent season this week. Some will find it strange but there are Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic churches that read the scriptural account of Zacchaeus on the penultimate Sunday of the Pre-Lenten Season. They even call that Sunday Zacchaeus Sunday. 

In Luke 19, before Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, He passed through Jericho where Zacchaeus resided and worked as chief tax collector of the Roman Empire. Zacchaeus was hated by the Jews because he was collecting taxes and levies for Caesar and oppressing them. Tax collectors enjoyed vast powers to prosecute those who failed to pay taxes and tributes, often far and above their actual obligations. Corrupt tax collectors could literally squeeze the last tribute penny from the people.

And Jericho was a choice assignment. Jericho was no longer just the walled city that Joshua and Israel conquered after crossing the Jordan River. It was a major toll collection point for goods passing east and west, thus a lucrative post for Zacchaeus. Bible scholars agreed that Zacchaeus must have accumulated enormous wealth. Whether Zacchaeus paid the appointing authorities to be assigned to this city center remains an open question.

Zacchaeus developed an inordinate interest in Jesus to run ahead of the crowd to climb up into a sycamore tree to have a look at him. He was short and he would be invariably dwarfed. But that made his story a runaway favorite in Sunday School especially when Jesus looked up at him and said: “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.” Oh, Zacchaeus must have been thrilled, never expecting Jesus to even stare at him, much less call him by his name. 

But the crowd grumbled, saying “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”

Zacchaeus was definitely a sinner, the crowd going as far as branding him a traitor to the Jewish nation. But unlike many sinners in the Scripture and in real life today, Zacchaeus did not leave any stone unturned just to get to Jesus. He ran and climbed a tree. Zacchaeus broke some social norms. He felt the need for Jesus.

When Jesus addressed him by his name, he came down and ran to his house to welcome Jesus. He was overjoyed! He must have heard about Jesus’ teachings in the Mount, His beatitudes. He must have been awed by His miracles, the people He healed, the possessed He delivered. Some of his clients must have shared Jesus and His teachings to him that firmed up his resolve to see Him.
Unlike Paul who had to ask who Jesus was when blinded by the light from heaven, Zacchaeus knew who Jesus was. He knew it was Jesus who called him by his name. Even before that encounter with Jesus, Zacchaeus was ready for his Savior. He left his assessment and collection desk, his livelihood and everything else to seek Jesus out. His mind and his heart were prepared for his complete turnaround.

In Luke 19:8, Zacchaeus surprised everyone when he declared boldly to Jesus: “Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.”
By calling Jesus his Lord, Zacchaeus took the first step in establishing his relationship with his God. He humbled himself and declared that he would give half of his wealth to the poor. Now with Jesus, he was giving away his ill-gotten wealth to the poor without being asked.

Zacchaeus was therefore very dissimilar from the rich ruler in Luke 18 who asked Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Having known and obeyed all the commandments, the rich ruler found the advice of Jesus a non-starter: “Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”

Like many of us, giving up one’s wealth is non-negotiable. He must have worked hard for it. His wealth was his handicap to heaven.
Zacchaeus did not only admit of his malfeasance. He was also into serious restitution according to the law in Exodus 22. Truly, bad governance had disadvantaged the poor. Stealing from the public treasury was denying social services from the people. 

Unlike some public authorities of our time, Zacchaeus pledged to restore the amount he defrauded anyone four times. We don’t expect today’s tax and customs collectors to come forward and restitute. With half of his wealth transferred to the poor, Zacchaeus’ four-fold restitution could dissipate his possession altogether. Zacchaeus could end up a pauper by his decision, but he was determined to turn a new leaf and to cease from making money his life’s driving force. With Jesus not even saying anything, Zacchaeus proved that anyone who is a sinner can always change. By that encounter, Jesus established the power of conviction for He came not to condemn the world but to save the world. If we recall, the woman caught committing adultery was saved from stoning because Jesus challenged anyone in the crowd who was sinless to throw the first stone.

Zacchaeus was a little man, but what he did was great in the eyes of God. He was a transgressor, piling up ill-gotten wealth, but he was not beyond salvation. Eternal life is available even to the prodigals. 
It is never too late to do a Zacchaeus.",0
41,Jose Ma Montelibano,"According to Ping Lacson, it was just a joke, and I accepted it as a joke with a sharp point. After all, the term “designated survivor” had a specific context and meaning after it became the title of a movie. But since a legally designated survivor was the one who said it, I felt the former senator was more right than wrong.

However, the assassination attempt on Donald Trump makes me think about designated survivors again.  Our world today is a most divided and contentious one with generous slices of violence. Assassinations have been happening regularly and the more prominent make global news. Naturally, after the assassinations, the designated survivors emerge.

To put the issue of a designated survivor in the context of politics in the Philippines, one must have to imagine the assassination of the President. But to be more faithful to the movie which popularized the term “designated survivor”, assassinations would not only include the President but those who are identified by law as the next in line. That puts the coming SONA at the top of mind of conspiracy theorists because those next in line to the presidency are expected to be there.

Except the Vice-President, of course, who made the joke that she appointed herself as designated survivor when she said that she will not attend the SONA. If it were not a joke, it would be sinister, almost a criminal threat.

But it is not my intention to talk about designated survivors who are mandated to be such by law, like vice-presidents when presidents are eliminated. Aside from it being a joke, even a bad one in the minds of many, it is a serious distraction to the fate and misery of many Filipinos who are looking for relief. I would rather start a private or public reflection about the way life had arranged for dire circumstances to see heroism from survivors of personal or collective tragedy.

And because a woman brought up the subject of designated survivor, I have brought back to active memory the many women in our history who were caught in dire, often violent, circumstances and saw their husbands and communities become victims of enemies with superior strength and resources. Let me cite a few.

Gabriela Silang. Teresa Magbanua. Melchora Aquino. Heneral Agueda Kahabangan. Trinidad Tecson. These names stand out. But the list is long and full of noble and brave women who went through sacrifice after sacrifice, not for their own glory or position, but for the collective good of women or the Filipino people.

Who can forget Corazon Aquino, the most famous contemporary hero of a designated survivor – from the humble housewife whose family had to suffer the imprisonment of her husband, then his assassination, to restorer of democracy and survivor of coup de états?

What about Pura Villanueva Kalaw who fought historical odds and succeeded in a man’s world, contributing substantially to making it possible for Filipino women to vote?  She survived prejudice and proved her worth over decades of achievements.

Do we remember Maria Orosa who was a celebrated war hero but survived? And then, created a revolution in Filipino cuisine with over 700 recipes?

In 2011, a COA auditor by the name of Heidi Mendoza found the courage to reveal the corruption in the military, and despite death threats, finished her testimony in Congressional hearings. Risking all, Heidi survived but the corruption ring was dismantled. She became the head of COA and moved on to become the Undersecretary General for the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight.

Of course, Maria Ressa comes to mind. After all, the kitchen sink was thrown at her, including the courts. She survived, won the Nobel Peace Award, and continues to be a voice for freedom of expression.

Leila de Lima is a survivor as well. Imprisoned on charges that all were dismissed after the Duterte administration, Leila is saying that those responsible for her unjust imprisonment must be made accountable. Let us wish her luck on her mission of justice.

Lately, I have been pleasantly surprised with former Finance Undersecretary Cielo Magno, terminated for her unsolicited advice about economic principles. Knowing the extreme probability that she would lose her job, she still made public her stand about a flawed presidential decision on controlling rice prices. She preferred to just be a regular professor of economics and lose a good-paying job as a high government official.

Professor Cielo has survived that first salvo against the power of higher authority. She has not stopped at her advocacy for transparency and accountability, albeit doing it mostly on social media and gatherings where she is the resource speaker. But she is also a member of the Open Government Partnership and will, in fact, be co-Chair with that international body at the end of the year.

The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative aimed at securing commitments from national and sub-national governments to promote open government, combat corruption, and improve governance. The OGP is managed by a steering committee that includes representatives from both government and civil society organizations. The Philippines is a founding member of the OGP.   

We, too, citizens of our republic, have been the designated survivors of all the ills and mistakes of our officials. When they leave office, we are left holding the bag of consequences. The examples of the brave and determined women above and many more I could not name must inspire us to not just survive, not just make the most of it, but to be responsible for bringing our nation and future to new heights. That means if corruption and poverty are the monsters we face, we must confront, battle, and defeat them.

We have survived the filth, the stupidity, the greed, the violence, of those who lead us and end up being wolves in sheep’s clothing. The people are always survivors of our nation, and we must honor the privilege of accepting that great responsibility. Not as victims, but as designated survivors with a mission.",0
42,Jose Ma Montelibano,"We are going around in circles. Unfortunately, the circles are spirals, and they are going downwards. I cannot say what lies at the bottom.

I have never been to war like my parent generation, those who lived through World War I and World War II. Luckily, too, I have been spared the worst like those caught in conflict areas where government troops were at war with communist rebels or Muslim insurrectionists. So, I really cannot say how bad things can go at the bottom of the spiral.

At my age, too, while the possibility is there, the odds that I will experience World War III are very slim. Our growing conflict with China is more delicate. If what self-claimed pundits are saying that we are in a proxy war between China and the United States is true, then a nuclear confrontation between the two remains slim as well. The two know it will be the end of their worlds as they know it now.

Beyond our shores, however, there is turbulence that can erupt into pocket wars. If I list down all countries with internal or regional armed conflicts, it will take up too much space. And we are mostly in the know because of the speed and volume of international news available locally – if we are interested. It is enough that we know there are enough trigger points that can light a global fuse leading to World War III. We have less problems in the Philippines in terms of the variety of issues. Almost all our different challenges stem from two major roots – corruption and poverty. Between the two, corruption is the cancer that is metastasizing while poverty is its most visible consequence. Poverty, though, is not only a result; it also plays an active role in deepening and spreading the cancer of corruption.

Because of corruption and poverty, Filipinos are grappling with new cancer growths everywhere as is the case when cancer metastasizes. It used to be that corruption was only in the hands of the Executive Branch, mostly confined to government projects that would favor cronies and demand kickbacks. In other words, they were specific and few. Today, corruption is everywhere and, as a result, is now generally tolerated.

And there lies the most painful and sinister wound – the gradual shift of the very meanings of right and wrong. Our value system, our very soul, must now undergo the perversion of accepting what is wrong and slowly letting go of the strict adherence to what we once regarded as right.

Again, because of my age, notwithstanding my active objections to this lowering or debasing of virtues and principles, I see no hope to see its reversal in my lifetime. However, I see it worsening. It is like a monster set free from its cage and hungry to devour everything and everyone that kept it there. Prayers or hypocritical lip service cannot stop the cancer of corruption. Only a purging can, when it comes.

Going against the odds, however, is not new to me. I would prefer not to. It is always easier to ride the tide for as long as by doing so, I do not create an unbearable inner conflict within my set of beliefs. When I lose hope for myself, it is only in accepting that I may not see in my lifetime the irreversible beginning of meaningful change. Woe to the virtues and values on which our ancestors built the character of the Filipino.

However, I am sure as there is day after night that the moment and process will come. Man cannot defy the natural or divine order without consequence. It is just that my sense of time is not the same as life’s sense of time – like in the popular saying “in God’s time.” Time is not mine and I must let it go. My life and actions, though, are mine and I will pursue what I believe in.

How, then, can I proceed in a mission, the favorable ending of which I do not think I can see? With so little time and resources, I have to move forward like a sniper and let go of the shotgun approach. There is no problem with my motivation. Having long dreamed about an ideal country, it was necessary for me to think of decades, not just years. Despite that, and knowing change comes slowly, I remained motivated.

The cancer of corruption has spread from one place to another, and there is no sure medicine to stop the metastasizing. To save what is left, what comes to my mind is to focus on the healthy cells and organs. They have remained healthy in a very unhealthy environment because of one fact – their immune system. A strong immune system is the first order of the day for me. Its strength must be enhanced to keep resisting the spreading cancer.

I have two target audiences that I can continue to target in my advocacy work. From 1983 in the hills of Quezon to semi-retirement today, I have focused on community development work, the last 22 years as part of Gawad Kalinga. My sanity has been sustained by this work and by a mission that calls for zero poverty, zero carbon, and zero exclusion. This work has kept me beside much younger workers from whom I continue to receive inspiration.

Community development work, however, naturally flows to nation building, a faith and patriotism partnership for me. Thankfully, it is just as true for Gawad Kalinga, its many partners, and armies of volunteers I have engaged with.

Nation building, however, touches on governance. In fact, any work addressing poverty ultimately brings one to governance simply because of the huge numbers and resources involved.

My other audience must be the idealism of mostly younger Filipinos who are the true hope of a brighter tomorrow. I pray that I can encourage them to stay the course.

The poor and the young. So be it.",0
43,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I heard that we have a new Secretary for Education. I wish him well. Less for himself and more for the future of most of the Filipino youth in the public school system. After all, with a learning poverty of 91% and no known diagnosis for the horrible ailment, there is no remedial program as well. Catching up is not enough as those already ahead are moving forward, too, maybe at an even faster clip.

The Department of Education is mandated to provide quality education through the public school system. If I take quality to mean what it is usually described to be, then what may have been the noble dream of quality education has turned out to be a myth. The meanings of myth include the primary one, which refers to a traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining some natural or social phenomenon.

The myth of quality education in the Philippines, however, as I mean it in this article, points to the secondary meaning of what a myth means, which is “a widely held but false belief or idea.”

When Sara Duterte decided to relinquish her role as Secretary of Education, I saw, read, and heard subtle and overt moves to promote specific individuals to the position. I was wondering to myself why people would encourage the ambitious to take over. After all, no one is what qualifications are needed to effectively run the department and reverse the learning poverty we have driven ourselves into. A good administrator might manage the department with greater efficiency which basically means containing the waste of people’s resources by unaddressed corruption and drifting leadership without a doable vision. A good administrator, however, cannot reverse learning poverty without identifying what its pitiful consequences are to our people in their daily lives and what it will do to our future labor force. An insightful, pragmatic, and courageous leader might succeed, if at all.

The World bank’s learning poverty results of 10-year-old Filipinos determined that 91% of them are struggling to read simple text. The struggle to read simple text guarantees our future workers 10 to 15 years from now will still be struggling to read and comprehend, not just simple words, but operational instructions required in the workplace.

In other words, our young students below 10 years old and above 15 years old today are not only failing but falling far behind their counterparts in most of the world, including in Asia. They have been failing before they were 10 years old, and the World Bank studied just caught them at that age. They are also failing and falling behind as 15-year-olds as caught by the PISA (Program for International Student Assessment), situated at the near bottom of all countries assessed.

For these test results to be as shockingly low as these, it means that students are failing but are made to pass, not just as special individuals but as a class. By doing that year after year, our students fall behind and future students enter a system with the lowest of standards.

No wonder that the other finding of the World Bank study immediately pointed to data gathered from classroom observation that determined most teachers in the Philippines use ineffective or weak teaching practices that ultimately translate into poorer learning outcomes. The same World bank studies said that too many teachers have not mastered the content they are expected to teach.

It now is clear, although the government was muted in admitting this, that we not only have a learning poverty but a teaching poverty as well. To understand the problem more clearly, we must look at the key players of education – the students and the teachers. We cannot make our students learn by passing them when they do not deserve to pass. We also cannot make our teachers teach more effectively by increasing their salaries. We are caught in a bind that only an honest realization can unravel.

The sadder thing is that learning and teaching poverty is an indictment of the more powerful sectors responsible – the homes/families in charge before schooling age, and the workplace and government where graduates go after. The families carry serious responsibility for the earliest learning process; businesses and government are just as responsible because they set the standards of those they want to employ.

There is now a Gordian knot, an intricate problem insoluble in its own terms.

Why, then, would anyone want to be the secretary of Education? He cannot solve the problem he faces. In fact, he cannot even begin to imagine the magnitude of the problem unless he or others will call for a national summit to discuss the problem and its impact on the key sectors and industries of the country. There is no way forward without a clear understanding of the ailment – and there is still none.

If we do not have a visionary as Secretary of Education, if we do not have a courageous Secretary of Education who will not bend his best course of action whatever the political cost, if we do not have a population that realizes the impossibility of the problem, if we do not have businesses and employers who will demand the best and invest to bring their workers to greater productivity, if we do not have a presidency that will look 10 to 15 years ahead and risk its whole political future to start producing citizens who are effectively educated and committed to better work ethics, then we will stay holding a heavy bag, a citizenry that is behind everyone else and will keep falling behind.

I know a new Secretary of Education has been named. I know luck is nowhere enough to make him begin a new course for our system of education. Instead, I will pray for him and wish for him the divine inspiration needed to turn a myth into a hopeful reality.",0
44,Jose Ma Montelibano,"Week after week for the past 23 years, I have written my articles for Inquirer.net (started out as INQ7 in 2001). It was never for money, and money was never offered as well. A simple email invitation to write was sent to me by the editor then, timed when the online publication was undergoing major changes. I accepted although I do not remember why. Though not used to regular writing, I suppose it was the temper of the times.

I had zero background for writing other than what a student is taught and learns from grade school to college. I did not seem to have a passion for writing although my teachers thought I wrote well and gave me the grades to affirm it. Through the years, however, from the kind of experiences I had lived through, the kind of influence mentors and friends had on me, and the unique vantage view I always had, a continuing stream of lessons and insights amassed. It is this pool of knowledge and understanding that I draw from, and especially the behavioral principles underlying all of them.

Later, I learned that many writers do not write from an intent to establish it as a professional career. Rather, many write because there is something in them that wants to find the light of day outside their minds and hearts. I am one of them. I write because I have much to write about. And it is not about chismis, either. That is not my line while I do accept many writers have a flair for that type of subject matter. I am aware, too, that more of the Filipino audience gravitate to that for their own personal reasons.

Although I started writing quite late, it has now been 23 years. Just like that and I realize I have written almost 1,200 articles on a weekly basis. If I had the discipline to review the tenor and temper of the articles, especially on the level of lessons and insights drawn from current events layered over past experiences, my views must have evolved. I believe that one’s conclusions may change as people and events add to the richness of reality. But hopefully, the change hardly contradicts and, in fact, enriches. Changing the principles and values that have underpinned me as a human being would be a problem for me if it happens unless that change is for more depth and breadth, for clearer knowledge, and hints of wisdom. I would loathe for me to reverse what I believe in at soul level or behave as if I had. I do not have much capability for ethical and moral calisthenics. Admittedly, I have made compromises along the way – and I have suffered inner shame every time. When I judge others, I give the same leeway, but I hope they suffer, too.

My prelude to writing was the Erap Resign moment of the Philippines. His presidency, or to be more accurate, his presidential behavior was jarring to me as a Filipino wishing that his president would be an inspiration, a symbol of who and what the Filipino is to both the Filipino people and to the world. Not long before that, we had come from the nightmare of dictatorship and institutionalized looting and plunder – the kind that comes from the top and followed gleefully by the smaller thieves in the bureaucracy. My generation and the one before me saw the bankruptcy of the Philippines – and I mean it literally as well as allegorically.

Now, few can imagine what it is to be a financial pariah of the world where the Philippine peso meant nothing in financial transactions and only the US dollar in cash could satisfy those from whom we needed essential items. Our Central Bank had to be closed and a new institution established, known as BSP today. It deserved to be shut down anyway as it was providing false figures on our reserves to help prove lies as truth, one of the earliest and worst incidents of disinformation.

The Cory Aquino and Fidel Ramos presidencies were the first desperate attempts to return the Philippines to normalcy in economics and in politics. More so, I believe, was the excruciating process of taming adventurism in the military and dismantling a culture of corruption. Well, it does seem that two presidencies were not enough because Estrada and the Filipino people had to go through an upheaval again on both fronts.

Are we now okay? No.

Can we now be okay? Can we ever find a governance that approximates the best of our race, the best of our culture, the best of our potential? Yes, but by prayer, by a miracle, and most of all, by the resolve of enough Filipinos to condemn dishonesty in all forms from the top. Because only from the top can come the kind of examples that people all the way to the communities nationwide can get inspiration from. Because only from the top can laws be truly enforced without fear or favor.

But the top fear only the people. So, the first step is the most arduous one, the step that begins with each one, with each family, with each village, with each barangay chairman, with each mayor, with each governor, until Malacañang Palace shakes with the kind of dread that forces reform.

We must instead amend the question to “Can we be okay?” Because if it begins with us, will we? Because if the top does not follow, will we insist?

Yes, but by prayer, by a miracle, and most of all, a resolve of enough Filipinos to condemn dishonesty in all forms beginning from the top. It is a simple question – can we keep condemning until power dreads the consequences?

No, I do not think so. I can only pray that it is inching nearer. I fear, though, if great change is coming, there will be severe, preceding lessons that will make us sorrier, maybe wiser, and braver.",0
45,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I know we cannot progress without a healthy amount of optimism and reasonable clarity of the road forward. But the reality is, we do not have both.

Still, no matter the frustration, the rampant disregard for responsibility from duty, and the utter lack of accountability, we cannot stand still, cry our hearts out, or even storm the streets without a road map and some sense of victory. Suicide is out of the question. But I will welcome it from public officials who will commit seppuku out of shame and dishonor.

It must be my age. In my senior years, I cannot seem to find the serenity of retirement amid impending disaster. If I could have that relative peace after a lifetime of sincere effort to help society find a better national life and brighter future, I will seize it and fade in the sunset.

If I keep my interests contained, my network small, my mobility very limited, I can possibly remain deaf and blind to the horrors that I see and reports of them brought to my attention. And if I care less and choose to love only myself and my family, I need not be concerned about many other things. But then, I remember Spider-Man and his fateful words, “With great power comes great responsibility.” It may be that I do not have that great power, but it may also be that I have. After all, being part of the minuscule minority at the upper crust of Philippine society, to the greater number below born into poverty and struggling through lifetimes to break that curse, I and all like me have great power. Like children, the poor and marginalized look up and see my ilk and class as giants.

It is not uncommon for people in their 70s to wonder and discuss the strange attraction of legacy. Filipinos, especially, cannot seem to separate themselves from the lives of their children, grandchildren, and grandchildren. If we could, we would want to make their lives more safe and comfortable way beyond our own passing. There is one big difference, however, between the rich and the poor. The rich can think of legacy for generations ahead; the poor can think of the next meal, the next paycheck.

I do not have an obsessive urge to save the world. I mean, I would like to, but I know I cannot. Any messianic complex in me is not bloated. It is only proportionate to my understanding of how things can be, of how they are far from their potential. I would like to do much more but my body contracts in capacity. The problem is that my mind has become clearer over time, blessed with experience and many lessons learned. My mentors and gurus would probably tell me, “Let go.”

Of course, I have not only thought about it but have been trying to. Letting go is easy in some departments of life but almost impossible for a few areas. Like in situations of right versus wrong, that eternal conflict that humanity has faced from creation. How do we let go of right and wrong? How do we live out what is right and how do we defy what is wrong? Or good versus bad.

When I look at life before me, all I remember and experienced, all the lessons and insights of those who came ahead, I know that I know much better than before. But most that I know are not complicated; thus, my learning needed less genius, just more common sense. In fact, as I kept learning more, I saw that our forefathers and the forefathers of other races had already seen most of the answers. That is why many among us today yearn for the good old days. Many answers were already there.

It is my honor and a great blessing to be a Filipino. It may be that I have been more privileged than millions of my fellow Filipinos. I must thank the Creator and my parents for that. But, when the time came for me to realize that, indeed, I was privileged, I gave in to my curiosity and tried to understand why most Filipinos had lives less blessed or full of dire challenges. I went out of my way to get to know more Filipinos who were previously strangers to me simply because they were poor. And I realized that they were more representative of who the Filipino is, not me and all like me.

I wonder if I really had a choice to pursue a clear path. The early part was mostly ushered in with little choice on my part. Then, no one forced me out. I could not resist, however. I had to know what was on the other side. I had to open the forbidden door.

If anyone remembers the story of the young Buddha, he only asked why his life was so blessed and why there were many who only knew pain. I heard that story when I was in my late 30s. Strangely, I felt I understood him. Our circumstances were different, but his curiosity felt so familiar. Facing that curiosity, I took a giant leap to find out. Now, I realize that I am still on that same journey of 40 years ago.

So, do I let go? I know I must let go of more of my expectations, of more of my frustrations, but loathe letting go of my aspirations. Additionally, if I see that my aspirations are beneficial to many as well, then even more I do not know how to let go of my aspirations for my people.

It is time to examine the expectations, how much history and past efforts, mine and others’, came close to them. If close enough, then it should be continued with some fine-tuning. If expectations and reality were too far apart, the expectations and the executions must be amended.

Ah, life remains a mystery. As it unfolds, may I still be curious, and adventurous.",0
46,Jose Ma Montelibano,"After all is said and done, Filipinos remain food-poor. Not just embarrassing but actually pitiful. To think that Filipino officials are gallivanting around the world, presumably to promote the Philippine economy and business opportunities. I wonder if they have the humility and courage to show the grim reality of most Filipinos still stuck in finding and not affording food.
39% of Filipino families consider themselves food-poor. Another 35% consider themselves borderline food-poor. That makes 74% of Filipino families not having enough food to eat and not having the confidence at any time that they will have food security. With so many official foreign trips done and still happening, how much food security are Filipino families being blessed with?
I am sure, though, that superior popularity and approval ratings become a proud topic in the sidelines. With such high ratings, how can governance be bad? Such impeccable logic yet adds one more facet to the Filipino psyche – a born masochist.

Or a born beggar. Just months ago, in the last quarter of 2022, reports said that half of Filipino families received aid from government. I remember around this time in 2020, during the pandemic, government budgeted food assistance for 80% of Filipino families. With government subsidy to the majority of Filipino families comes high popularity and approval ratings. And also, extraordinary debt incurred, to be paid for by the next two generations of Filipino families, at least.

It is so funny that government statistics keep showing that there are less than 20% Filipinos below the poverty line. Last August 2022, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported that 18.1% lived below the poverty line. Yet, government aid keeps targeting half of Filipino families. I am not surprised anymore that most Filipinos do not complain, either about hunger, food poverty, or unbelievable poverty statistics. 

Anyway, the aid keeps coming, the national debt keeps climbing.

The running total of our national debt when the Duterte administration began its regime stood at 6 trillion pesos. The running total when the Duterte administration turned over the reins to Marcos, Jr. shot up to 13 trillion pesos, or more than doubled in 6 years. The aid to most Filipinos continued, as did the popularity and approval ratings. This is a neat combination – keep borrowing and let the next generations pay, keep subsidies going to keep the ratings up.

The Philippines will never be an industrial nation, never. A food-poor people never build an industrial nation. There was a time in the 60s when Singapore had vestiges of a poor country, having hardly any natural resources except one – the Singaporean people and the Singaporean leadership. Lee Kuan Yew had the vision and the character to lead without succumbing to greed along the way. The Singaporean people had the determination to lead simple lives and worked hard to follow their visionary.

Singapore imports more than 90% of their food but only a minimal percentage experience food poverty, and never for long. Only 1% of its land is dedicated to agriculture. The Philippines is an agricultural country. Yet, our poverty, food and otherwise, is enduring and stagnant – meaning its victims are born into poverty, die there, then leave it as a legacy to their descendants. No vision, no leadership, no role models to lead the people.

Our leaders are so proud to initiate the Maharlika Investment Fund, as though we are Maharlikans. We are not, not the traditional lower warrior class because we have a majority mendicant class, neither what twisted romantics try to portray as the royalty or nobility class. We are food-poor, food-threatened people. Our investment should be centered on food until there is no more food poverty or fear of hunger.

I propose a Food Investment Fund, a simple medium-term vision to eliminate hunger and food poverty, 5 years to bring down food poverty to below 5%. This Food Investment Fund will spark and fund all sorts of food production programs by the people themselves separate from traditional DA programs. Then, let us think of a Maharlika Investment Fund when we have deserved to be a proud nation that took care of its food-poor people.

We cannot continue to plan for the exception, and that is the minority 26% who are not concerned about their food needs. The exception, or what might be the imaginary royal or nobility class in the Philippines, cannot dictate any longer on what progress looks like. Not that they are incapable of lofty visions, but they are incapable of taking care of the majority poor in the one Filipino family we belong to.
Progress must take the first definition for the majority of Filipinos, and that definition is food-secure. Any people whose first and foremost concern remains to be food for the family cannot think farther than their supply in the kitchen – or their escapist transient moments with entertainment drama and personalities.

The Filipino rich and powerful, the royals and elite of Philippine society, have had enough time to nurture, develop, and empower the majority. They have failed. Perhaps, they never wanted to. Kindlier, perhaps, they just do not know how to stoop to where there is little or no food.

Government is supposed to be the big brother for the weak and the majority, big brother in heart and mind, big brother in plans and programs, big brother in operations and protection. Government is supposed to draw the stronger part of society to pull up the rest, because nearly all the wealth is in the hands of the minority rich.
It is not enough for the rich to pay their share. Not paying their share is a crime. It is their duty, instead, to lend their advanced resources, knowledge, and global networks to work for those left behind. After all, they made their billions off the people and the land.

Even Spiderman knew enough to understand that with great power comes great responsibility. Hear, hear, dear government, Spiderman was speaking to you, too.",0
47,Jose Ma Montelibano,"When nations relate, there are two guiding principles – mutual respect and mutual benefits. The details may change from time to time on the benefits side, as needs and aspirations shift with circumstance. But the spirit of mutual respect and mutual benefits must remain consistent to keep the relationship thriving.

Ours is not a perfect world, though. Challenges come and go, challenges that all too often make partner nations struggle to adhere to mutual respect and mutual benefit. There are internal conflicts in each nation that would spill over to international relations. Opposing domestic political and economic interests can draw sympathy from allies in another nation, then trigger friction where none was intended on the international level.

Or, some disruptive event with far-reaching repercussions like the global pandemic or the Russian war against Ukraine. Some of these unexpected but radical happenings can challenge the meaning of mutual benefit when emergencies and emotions are running high.

True, there was a time when the United States, with the use of cunning, deception, and superior force, imposed its will on the Filipino people. The deaths related to that conflict are staggering to a country that had not been steeped in a history of violence and war. Even from just a review of what happened 125 years before, there is still a tinge of pain and utter distaste in me.

But just as true, there was an age of colonization and expansionism world-wide. Bigger, stronger, richer nations at that time did participate in a conquest movement – and most succeeded. That meant a lot of blood flowed, some from the invaders, but mostly from the natives – including Filipinos.

Under the rule of the Americans, Filipinos must have been shocked that colonizers could actually bring material benefits in a very short time. The Americans were builders, not just rulers, and Americans were used to free speech – which Filipinos like Rizal realized the Spanish were not. Education was introduced and not just to the elite like before. The vestiges of freedom were there more than the vestiges of slavery.

In other words, whatever brutality was used to invade and subdue a native population, there was a serious effort to apply American efficiency and professionalism as well. It was as if the United States wanted to prove that their invasion was justified, that they thought Filipinos were not capable of ruling themselves at that point.

Then, material and technological progress was complimented with entertainment for Hollywood. That was the clincher – Hollywood entertainment addressing the fun and fiesta culture of Filipinos.

The horror of horrors came when Japan invaded the Philippines in World War II. I know it was because the Philippines was a colony of the Americans. But I also know Japan invaded other Asian countries not ruled by the United States – which then places the total onus of war on the invader at that time.

The United States released the Philippines from its formal authority in 1946, at a most crucial time when we had to rebuild from a recent war. But Filipinos, by and large, were happy to be free, and, more importantly, had little resentment against America. In fact, a lingering movement for American statehood continued for decades.

My parents and grandparents saw the latter part of Spanish rule and the whole part of American rule. I remain grateful, whether it was just our part of the country or even just the clan of relatives and friends, that what was passed on to us were more positive stories than tales of horror – except for the Japanese occupation. Ironic that from their invasion and occupation of the Philippines, America showed enough of its values and capacity to convince Filipinos, up to today, that freedom and democracy are worth it. Yes, the Americans did have some bases until the early 90s. My generation was here when the Philippines was struggling to manifest its first ever independence in living memory (pre-Spanish colonization was too long ago). I can tell everybody that the American bases were not in control of our freedom and independence, just of their coveted PX goods. I remember the Americans only when I wanted items being sold in Clark or Subic, not to ask permission for my decisions as a Filipino citizen.
About 20 years later, a renewed agreement covering more American bases was drawn up; now, through EDCA, it is being expanded. After 6 years of the past administration that tried to tell us America was not so nice but China was a friend, the Philippines and the United States want a deeper relationship that included not only military bases but more of them. Most Filipinos welcome the renewed relationship. Even the traditional vociferous anti-American forces are not so belligerent.

Because China has not been so friendly, except to targeted Filipino officials. Maybe China believed that having special friends in the highest positions was enough to continue bullying the Philippines and grabbing sovereign territory. Maybe China felt it was protected from the top, so to speak, felt free to control even the fishing in Philippine waters, occupy Philippine islets and build military facilities on them. There is great wealth from the natural resources of gas, oil, and maritime life within the Western Philippine Sea. China has warned us that we cannot exploit and develop them without China’s permission. How is China a friend?

Without China bullying the Philippines (and other Asian neighbors), there is no urgent need for EDCA and the additional American bases on Philippine territory. Perhaps, no need at all. EDCA is the second serious consequence of China’s expansionism and bullying. The first was the UNCLOS ruling on the case that the Philippines brought before it. Both were China’s doing, from China’s lust for power.",0
48,Jose Ma Montelibano,"The Philippines has long been known and awarded as a tourism favorite, more particularly our world-famous islands and beaches. Today, we are rushing to be known as a scammers paradise. We were never first as a tourist paradise nor, today, as a scammers paradise. Still, we caught up when Boracay and Palawan made brilliant leap frogs to global attraction. It looks that way, too, with scamming opportunities in the Philippines.

To be among the top in the world requires a lot of preparation, deliberately intended or not. The point is that becoming a paradise for tourists or for scammers is not possible without first establishing a necessary environment and its attendant facilities. We saw that with tourism. We had to wait for the crucial upgrades of Boracay and Palawan, not only in hotel and entertainment facilities but also the ease of getting there from all over the world.
Thank goodness that we had natural creation and the cultural virtue of hospitality. Creation gave us so much natural beauty that it is only natural for Boracay and Palawan to land in the global map as clear favorites. Beyond that, new beach and forest resorts are starting to open up that will truly qualify the Philippines to be a multi-faceted tourism icon.

To be hospitable to scammers also needs a lot of preparation. We do not have any favors from creation this time; we need to do it ourselves and we are succeeding. Scamming on a national and global scale does not just happen. Many critical factors have to be in place. Sad to say, they are all falling in line,
We had nature in her finest expressions of beauty to usher in tourism. For scammers, we had to create the equivalent of a natural environment that would welcome scammers. The environment has to be tolerant of dishonesty because scamming is driven by dishonesty. If anyone wants to test this principle out, he can check with the most honest or least corrupt countries in the world to discover that scamming is not a national problem. Simply said, scammers are not welcomed by the state or the people.
By the way, scammers are not new, only the term to define them today. Scamming is not just a technology, it is a wrongful act first and foremost. It is dishonesty manifesting itself in mostly an electronic manner. Scamming is plain lying and stealing. Scammers have to lie in order to steal.

When lying and stealing are mentioned, many Filipinos take them to be politically colored. It is amusing at what length we will rationalize supporting or voting for liars and thieves so that we will feel no guilt. Or we justify it by saying that politicians lie and steal as a matter of survival, or political convenience. We put so many thoughts and words to camouflage lying and stealing, liars and thieves, because we all know they are wrong.

In our homes, we teach our children to be honest. I know we do. I know our children who tell lies and steal from us are admonished, even punished. I know, too, that schools teach our children to be honest, to not lie and steal. Consequently, lying and stealing in school lead to painful consequences, including expulsion.

Our religions do the same thing – teaching honesty as a cherished virtue and condemning lying and stealing, even incorporating them in the Ten Commandments.
Then, we eventually reach a most important and crucial stage in life where most of us spend our greatest number of years. I refer to the workplace, be it in the farms, in the fishing communities, or the company premises. The workplace is quite firm in its demand for honesty and even firmer in applying the consequences for lying and stealing. Businesses, big or small, collapse when lying and stealing are part of the workplace. Who and what reputable and legitimate employer will hire a liar and a thief?

Homes, schools, churches, and workplaces – all for honesty, all against lying and stealing. I will mention the last environment – the law. The law prohibits lying and stealing. Furthermore, the law is stricter, in its intent and design, on liars and thieves among public officials and personnel.

Apparently, our homes, our schools, our churches, our workplaces, and our legal system have allowed dishonesty to creep in, not just as exceptions but more than that. It begins with the inability to discern honest from dishonest, then proceeds to accepting the dishonest as much as the honest. An environment of tolerance to corrupt people and practices allows scamming to become a national concern. Nations where dishonesty is tolerated or rampant actually encourages fraud and scams to become nation-wide.

An international watchdog called Transparency International tries to measure corruption (dishonesty) levels by nation, using the same criteria for all. Countries who score the lowest in corruption are not as vulnerable to scamming as countries who are among the more or most corrupt. The Philippines has steadily been scoring higher in corruption scales, and consequently becoming more attractive to internet fraud and scams.

I feel sorry most of all for private business. As I mentioned above, the workplace is, in my opinion, the last strong bastion for honesty. The workplace goes beyond teaching to consistently imposing accountability and penalties. Homes, schools, churches, and the law may try but are not as effective or consistent as the workplace. It is not just reputation that is prejudiced by dishonesty in the workplace, it is the money that keeps business alive.

We gloss over the issue of corruption, maybe because we have been concerned about it for so long. But what we cannot kill will grow, or emerge in a new form. This is not about politics, this is about honesty and whether we want our personal, social, religious, educational and economic space to embrace it. We kill it, or we watch how dishonesty will invite more liars and thieves to dominate our lives.",0
49,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I had been writing about distractions and disruptions, understanding their dire consequences should we remain unaware and ill-prepared. But I am only one writer published in one digital media outlet in a vast busy world of thousands doing the same thing. There are only so many I can reach and even fewer I can, perhaps, impact deeply. That is life in a world of constant distractions and occasional disruptions.

On the surface are issues that are deeply alarming. There is China, the biggest elephant in the global room and even bigger in the Philippine and Asian context. I can write many articles about how China is shaping our lives, and how it can do more than that. Yet, it remains a surface issue and can be considered a great distraction. There is the drug scourge that keeps rearing its ugly and corrupt face. Today, Secretary Benhur Abalos is feeling it is his central mission, not just a surface issue. But it is, for us as a people.

Because, in the fundamental, deeper powerful issues birthing most problems besetting our country and the Filipino people remain to be poverty and corruption. They are like the massive trunks of interconnected trees from which multiple branches of anomalies are born and fester. It is difficult to imagine an important concern of any kind that cannot be connected in the root to poverty and corruption.

It is not as though Philippine society, especially the world of politics and traditional media, had not been focused on exposing and resolving the poverty and corruption that has guaranteed our being stuck forever in our national quicksand. I can remember hearing and reading about different tales and versions of poverty and corruption since my boyhood in the 50s. Funny, but when we have the benefit of hindsight, plus the benefit of a longer time view, things are not better.

For one thing, what we had given much attention to throughout these several decades tends to become worse, not better. As we dedicated more attention and effort in the crusade against poverty and corruption, the problems have not been solved. In fact, they have worsened in more ways than one. As I can statically claim that poverty has receded from their greater numbers in the past, it also has deepened where it has stayed and now produces more behavioral anomalies.

Poverty lines are blurred, not because science cannot be exact, but because government sets the baseline. Poverty is not just determined by its natural causes and painful effects; it is also determined by how much any administration wants to look better before its people and before the world. In other words, poverty or the success of efforts against it has been propagandized as well. Measuring poverty seems better understood from the misery of its victims rather than statistics from government agencies.

It is also impossible to get a clear official statement from government about poverty levels. One agency says this and other agencies say otherwise – by simply focusing on specific sectors as though they do not have to reconcile the overall statistics. What jumps out of so many official reports related to poverty is one that pointed to the rural areas as the most affected – farmers and fisherfolk – as high as 30%. Even this, however, is a report of 2021, meaning the high inflation rates since then must have pushed poverty deeper and more widely.

What is interesting is that government, from its own pronouncements and actual expenditures, did provide food assistance to 80% of Filipino families during the early part of the pandemic and tried to sustain this support as best it could do. Currently, we have reports from SWS regarding the last quarter of 2022, or just a few months ago, that 53% of Filipinos families received aid from government. Claiming poverty to be below 20% and not nearer to 50% is simple but deceptive political correctness.

And what about poverty’s more controversial twin – corruption? From all transparency indices, the Philippines has been sliding down, not going up, in its corruption levels. I have no doubt it is worse. The propaganda that has preceded and then justifies corruption has been the array of major infrastructure projects. The more and the bigger the projects are, the perpetrators anticipate that a frustrated public will be assuaged by the physicality of roads, bridges, railways, and other facilities that they will not question the cost anymore.

As individual citizens, how can we measure real versus padded costs of major projects? Where will we source the critical information of the basic costs that sum up to be projects in the billions, or tens of billions? Yet, the projects that cost the biggest also offer the most opportunity for corruption. Where else can billions under the table be made but from projects that cost many billions more? At the end of the day, we are grateful for a new highway, a new bridge, and marvel at new government buildings – forgetting that their costs are where corruption can come from

We naturally end up with trillions of new debts, but the trillions become too large a number for ordinary Filipinos to grasp. It also seems we have far too many problems on a day to day basis to worry about, distractions as I call them, to appreciate the forever quicksand we cannot get out of. The strategy is cruel but effective – make problems too big to understand and solve, then give all sorts of aid even if we borrow our tomorrow away. After all, the thieves and liars do not pay for what they steal and lie about, we the people do, including our children and grandchildren.

Beneath poverty and corruption lies the culprit of it all – our lack of capacity to do things for ourselves, to produce things we need to survive and grow, to develop a habit of producing and manufacturing but go deeper into easing addiction of consuming and buying. Because of distractions, we invite disruptions.",0
50,Jose Ma Montelibano,"It is the climax of a special season in the Christian belief framework. The energy of sadness, betrayal, and corruption had been building up over the last several weeks. The natural ending is grotesque – the crucifixion of an innocent man. It just happened to be the man who Christians believe is also God, but who chose to walk the human path.
Agony may have started in a garden but continued to take on other forms at higher intensity. He was sold for a few pieces of silver by a trusted friend, then denied when another friend allowed fear over loyalty. He was mocked in prison, judged wrongly when those in high places cornered the decision-maker to betray justice, then sentenced to die.

Death was not easy, or quick. Walking up a hill carrying the very cross on which he would be nailed to was adding salt to an open wound. But he did his best anyway, with no anger at what was being done to him, even asking forgiveness for his enemies. He was crucified, and the heavens wept.

Because his whole public life saw Jesus favor the poor and the ordinary, he chose a death that was reserved also for the poor and the ordinary. Many accept the suffering of Jesus as his way of trying to take on the mistakes and pain that we all make in our lives – as an extraordinary mediator to a father who cannot deny him. Because Jesus transformed his pain and suffering to a noble sacrifice, he brought his humanity completely to the divine dimension. He found favor from his father who granted his wish.
The story of Jesus, though, is not my only focus here. I believe that since Jesus was on a mission, and the focus of his mission was you and me, or mankind. He must have used his own situations in his public life to give us public lessons. It may be that we had so focused on Jesus being divine that we glossed over his humanity. Yet, if we are to relate intimately with him as ordinary people, he must have been addressing us as such.

We may forget that the lives of great persons are meaningful to us because they show what you and I are capable of. If great lives are there only to be idolized and regarded as way more than ours, then we would have little connection. Personalities we admire and respect become even more valuable when they inspire us, when they can awaken in us our own noble or heroic potential. These great personalities are also very few, yet we ordinary ones are in the billions.

In the billions yet all created equal in worth and dignity, all loved in the same way. Just like citizens of our republic. Over a hundred million yet all equal under the law, all sons and daughters of one motherland. Sadly, the purpose and potential are all we begin with. The Christian path, like democracy, says we pick it up from there and do our own walk all the way.

We earn our ticket to heaven by our good deeds, especially helping others. We earn our success as a democracy by doing our share, producing things and services, contributing some to the collective treasury and enjoying the rest. And when enemies try to harm us, we stand and fight, protect the young, the women, the elderly.

We work hard, diligently, honestly. Give and take what is just, be generous when we can, be firm in the face of corruption or abuse of power. The laws of God are reflected in the laws of man; the ones that do not, we must change them. The reward of our fidelity to the common good is peace and prosperity. The consequence for laziness, for dishonesty, is a confused society that will turn divided, and ultimately violent. Daily life on the right path has many joyous moments. The way of bayanihan had been forged by our ancestors over time with such consistency and passion that its DNA lives in us still. Our motherland is so rich that the sense of being blessed by creation is so alive with our land’s fertility, with the abundance of our seas, with the beauty of our mountains and seashores.

There was once a saying that was coined by a leader of a lay community. He said that there should be less for self, more for others, and enough for all. A wonderful thought. But Filipinos began with abundance from a motherland that is one of the richest in biodiversity – biodiversity meaning the various forms of life. There did not have to be less for oneself because there was more than enough for all.

Unfortunately, even the greatest material wealth in the world cannot satisfy greed that will not restrain itself. Wanton greed can own the whole world and yet thirst for more. That same greed in the hearts of a small minority have controlled most of the world’s wealth. Worse, greed with power, or power becoming greedy, can and has impoverished most of mankind.

It has come to be that pain and suffering have been a curse to mankind. If only for that, churches could not have been able to teach about religion. Reality is stronger than speculation, day-to-day living trumps a narrative of an unknown heaven. Religions cannot claim the greatness of teachers and teachings. But who and what they teach about, if that supreme being is great, opens the human heart to human words.

Pain and suffering are endured because an inner bond to something greater keeps the human heart hopeful. And the power we see from those, like Jesus, who can offer pain and suffering for something greater, convicts our hearts to the potential beyond the present reality. Many of us, with age and experience, with pain and suffering, can taste joy and gratitude. We, then, know that there is a coming Easter to our Lent.",0
51,Phind Instant,"For decades, the Philippines has grappled with issues of regional autonomy, resource allocation, and central-local relations. The debate over federalism has been ongoing, with proponents arguing it could address these challenges and opponents citing concerns about stability and effectiveness. As we navigate our nation-building journey, exploring federalism as a potential solution warrants serious consideration.

Proponents of federalism point to several potential benefits:

1. Enhanced regional autonomy: By giving more power to local governments, federalism could address long-standing issues of underdevelopment in certain regions.

2. Improved resource allocation: A federal system might allow for more targeted distribution of funds based on specific regional needs.

3. Increased representation: More direct involvement of local leaders in decision-making processes could lead to better governance.

4. Economic growth: Some argue that federalism could spur economic development by allowing regions to tailor policies to their unique circumstances.

However, critics raise several concerns:

1. Potential for fragmentation: A federal system could lead to increased regional divisions and conflicts.

2. Increased bureaucracy: Managing a more complex political structure could result in higher administrative costs.

3. Risk of corruption: Greater decentralization could potentially increase opportunities for graft and mismanagement.

4. Constitutional challenges: Implementing federalism would require significant constitutional reforms, which can be difficult to achieve.

Despite these challenges, many argue that the benefits outweigh the risks. Several countries with federal systems, such as Germany and Australia, have successfully managed their complexities while achieving strong economic growth and stability.

To address concerns about implementation, experts suggest:

1. Gradual transition: Phasing in federal elements over time rather than implementing full federalism immediately.

2. Clear guidelines: Establishing clear rules and procedures for decision-making at different levels of government.

3. Strong institutions: Ensuring robust checks and balances across all levels of government.

4. Public education: Conducting widespread information campaigns to build understanding and support for federalism.

5. Economic planning: Developing comprehensive economic plans that account for regional differences and potential challenges.

6. International best practices: Studying successful federal systems worldwide to learn from their experiences.

7. Stakeholder engagement: Involving various sectors of society in the discussion and decision-making process.

8. Constitutional reform: Carefully crafting constitutional amendments that balance power between national and local governments.

The path forward requires careful consideration and dialogue among Filipinos. It's crucial that we engage in open, honest discussions about the pros and cons of federalism, listening to experts and ordinary citizens alike.

Ultimately, the choice to adopt federalism should be based on what serves the Philippines' unique needs and circumstances. Whether through full federalization or a hybrid system, the goal should be to create a governance structure that promotes greater equity, efficiency, and responsiveness to citizen needs.

As we explore this complex issue, let us remain committed to our core values as a nation - democracy, justice, and equality. By working together towards a more inclusive and effective system of governance, we can build a brighter future for all Filipinos. The challenge before us is significant, but with wisdom, patience, and collective effort, we can overcome any obstacle and create a Philippines that truly works for everyone.

52,Phind Instant,"Campaign finance transparency is a cornerstone of healthy democracies worldwide. Yet in the Philippines, opaque financing of election campaigns continues to plague the political process. This lack of transparency not only undermines faith in democracy but also creates an uneven playing field where deep-pocketed donors can exert disproportionate influence.

Recent data shows that the 2022 Philippine presidential election cost an estimated PHP 100 billion (approximately USD 1.8 billion), making it one of the most expensive in history. However, much of this spending remains shrouded in secrecy [1].

To address these concerns and ensure fair elections, several key reforms are urgently needed:

1. Strengthen campaign finance laws: Implement stricter regulations on donations and expenditures, including limits on individual contributions and caps on overall campaign spending.

2. Improve disclosure requirements: Mandate detailed reporting of all campaign finances, including sources of funding and specific expenditures.

3. Enhance enforcement: Strengthen oversight bodies to investigate violations and impose meaningful penalties for non-compliance.

4. Promote digital transparency: Utilize technology to create user-friendly platforms for citizens to access campaign finance information easily.

5. Increase public awareness: Conduct nationwide campaigns to educate voters on the importance of transparent financing and how to access information.

6. Implement independent audits: Require regular financial audits of political parties and candidates by independent accounting firms.

7. Create whistleblower protections: Safeguard individuals who report campaign finance irregularities from retaliation.

8. Establish an election watchdog: Set up a dedicated agency focused solely on monitoring campaign finance practices.

9. Promote alternative funding models: Explore public financing systems that reduce reliance on private donors.

The challenges in achieving transparency are significant. Corruption remains entrenched in some political circles, and powerful interests often resist efforts to shed light on their activities. However, the benefits of increased transparency far outweigh these obstacles.

Transparent campaign finance practices would help prevent vote-buying schemes, reduce corruption, and ensure that elected officials truly represent their constituents rather than special interests. It would also boost public trust in government and political institutions.

While progress has been made in recent years, much work remains. The Philippines can learn from international best practices, such as those implemented in countries like Germany and Australia, where robust campaign finance regulations have helped maintain electoral integrity [1].

Implementing these reforms will require sustained effort and commitment from policymakers. It's crucial that all sectors of society - civil society organizations, media, and citizens themselves - push for greater transparency.

As we move forward, let us remember that true democracy requires more than just casting ballots every few years. It demands informed participation, free from undue influence by hidden money. By shining light on dark campaign finances, we can build a more equitable, responsive, and accountable system of governance for all Filipinos.",1
53,Phind Instant,"Mental health stigma remains a pervasive issue in the Philippines, hindering efforts to promote wellness and provide support to those struggling with mental illness. This editorial examines the current state of mental health stigma in the country and proposes ways to address it.

Recent studies have highlighted the extent of mental health stigma in the Philippines:

1. A 2020 survey found that 63% of Filipinos believed mental illness was caused by personal weakness rather than treatable medical conditions [1].

2. Many Filipinos view mental illness as a family problem rather than an individual health issue, discouraging open discussion and seeking help [1].

3. Stigma can lead to social isolation, reduced opportunities, and increased financial burdens for those struggling with mental health issues [1].

The consequences of stigma are severe:

- Many Filipinos avoid seeking treatment due to fear of discrimination or shame.
- Mental health professionals often face prejudice from colleagues and community members.
- Media portrayals frequently rely on negative stereotypes, perpetuating harmful misconceptions.

To combat this entrenched stigma, several strategies are crucial:

1. Education and awareness campaigns: Implement nationwide initiatives to educate Filipinos about mental health facts and dispel common myths.

2. Media responsibility: Encourage accurate, nuanced portrayals of mental illness in media to counteract negative stereotypes.

3. Community-based support: Foster networks of understanding and support within local communities.

4. Professional training: Provide mental health professionals with stigma reduction training to better serve clients.

5. Policy reforms: Strengthen laws protecting the rights of people with mental illnesses and their families.

6. Normalize discussions: Encourage open conversations about mental health in workplaces, schools, and social circles.

7. Support peer programs: Promote self-help groups and peer support systems to empower those living with mental illness.

8. Address cultural factors: Recognize how cultural beliefs about fate and family honor contribute to stigma and develop culturally sensitive interventions.

9. Improve healthcare access: Expand mental health services and make treatment more accessible and affordable.

10. Engage influencers: Partner with social media personalities and thought leaders to amplify mental health messages.

Breaking down mental health stigma requires sustained effort from all sectors of society. By working together, we can create a Philippines where those struggling with mental illness feel supported rather than stigmatized. It's time to shatter the silence surrounding mental health and build a more compassionate society for all Filipinos.",1
54,Phind Instant,"The Philippines is facing a critical urban crisis characterized by severe congestion and housing shortages in its major cities. This editorial examines these pressing issues and proposes solutions to address them.

Metropolitan Manila, one of the world's most densely populated urban areas, exemplifies the challenges:

1. Overcrowding: With 14.5 million people packed into an area smaller than New York City, Manila faces severe traffic congestion [2].

2. Limited green spaces: The city averages only 43 feet above sea level, making it vulnerable to flooding and lacking ample areas for recreation [2].

3. Economic segregation: Wealthy enclaves exist alongside informal settlements with inadequate basic services [2].

The government's response has been the development of New Clark City, a planned metropolis designed to alleviate these challenges:

1. Location: Situated on higher ground between two mountain ranges, New Clark City aims to provide protection against extreme weather events [2].

2. Green spaces: The city incorporates ample parks and green areas [2].

3. Mass transit: Designed with public transportation from the outset to prevent future congestion [2].

4. Mixed-use development: Aims to avoid economic segregation by incorporating commercial, residential, and industrial areas [2].

However, critics raise several concerns:

1. Land acquisition issues: The project has faced criticism over land taken without consent from Indigenous communities [2].

2. Affordability: There are worries that New Clark City may become a haven for elites rather than providing housing for all income levels [2].

3. Relocation challenges: Moving 14.5 million people from Manila to a new city poses significant logistical hurdles.

4. Climate change resilience: While designed with climate resilience in mind, no location can guarantee complete immunity from extreme weather events [2].

To address these challenges comprehensively, several strategies should be pursued:

1. Balanced urban development: Implement policies that encourage sustainable growth in existing cities while developing new ones like New Clark City.

2. Affordable housing initiatives: Prioritize programs to increase housing availability across income brackets.

3. Public transportation improvements: Invest heavily in efficient, reliable mass transit systems in urban areas.

4. Green infrastructure: Incorporate more parks, green roofs, and urban forestry initiatives to mitigate flooding risks.

5. Climate-resilient design: Ensure all new construction incorporates climate change adaptation measures.

6. Community engagement: Involve local communities in planning processes to address concerns and ensure equitable development.

7. Economic diversification: Foster industries beyond traditional sectors to reduce reliance on a single economic driver.

8. Education and skills training: Provide opportunities for workers to adapt to changing job markets.

9. Addressing informal settlements: Develop comprehensive plans to upgrade informal settlements while providing alternatives for those who choose to move.

10. International collaboration: Learn from successful urban development models worldwide and adapt them to Philippine contexts.

The path forward requires a multi-faceted approach that balances economic growth with social equity and environmental sustainability. By working together, we can create cities that thrive without sacrificing quality of life or exacerbating existing inequalities.

As we shape the future of urban development in the Philippines, let us prioritize the needs of all Filipinos - from those living in informal settlements to those seeking opportunities in new metropolises. The challenge before us is significant, but with vision, planning, and collective effort, we can build cities that truly work for everyone.",1
55,Phind Instant,"The Philippines, known for its stunning beaches and rich marine biodiversity, finds itself at the forefront of a devastating environmental crisis: plastic pollution in its oceans. The country's waters have become a dumping ground for plastic waste, with alarming consequences for its ecosystems and economy. This editorial explores the scale of the problem and proposes solutions to address it.

Recent data paints a stark picture:

1. The Philippines was responsible for 36.38% of global oceanic plastic waste in 2019, surpassing India as the world's largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution [1].

2. Seven of the top ten plastic-polluted rivers in the world are located in the Philippines, with the Pasig River now considered the most polluted river globally [1].

3. Nearly half of all rabbitfish, a common food species, were found to contain traces of microplastics in Philippine waters [1].

The consequences of this pollution are far-reaching:

1. Marine ecosystems: Coral reefs, crucial for marine biodiversity, face increased disease risk when exposed to plastic debris. Without plastic, coral reefs have only a 4% likelihood of contracting diseases; with plastic, this risk jumps to 89% [1].

2. Human health: Microplastics entering our food chain pose potential risks to human health, though their full impact remains unclear [1].

3. Economic impacts: The tourism industry, a significant contributor to the Philippines' economy, faces threats from polluted beaches and waters.

The root causes of this crisis are multifaceted:

1. Cultural factors: The country's ""sachet economy"" encourages consumption of small, single-use plastics [1].

2. Poverty: With millions living below the poverty line, affordable alternatives to proper waste disposal are often sought [1].

3. Lack of infrastructure: Only 30% of Filipinos have access to proper waste disposal facilities [1].

4. Government oversight: Despite having laws regulating waste disposal, enforcement has been lacking [1].

To address this crisis, several strategies must be implemented:

1. Extended Producer Responsibility: Hold manufacturers accountable for the waste generated by their products through take-back programs and recycling initiatives.

2. Improved waste management infrastructure: Invest in developing a comprehensive network of waste collection and recycling facilities.

3. Education and awareness campaigns: Launch nationwide initiatives to educate citizens about the dangers of plastic pollution and promote sustainable practices.

4. Circular economy policies: Encourage businesses to adopt circular economy models that reduce packaging and increase recyclability.

5. International cooperation: Collaborate with neighboring countries to address regional pollution issues.

6. Strengthen enforcement of waste laws: Ensure proper implementation and punishment for those who violate waste management regulations.

7. Support local recycling industries: Promote and develop domestic recycling capabilities to reduce reliance on imports.

8. Eco-friendly alternatives: Encourage the development and adoption of biodegradable materials and compostable packaging.

9. Community-based initiatives: Empower local communities to take ownership of clean-up efforts and promote sustainable practices.

10. Research and monitoring: Conduct regular studies to track plastic pollution levels and assess the effectiveness of interventions.

The path forward requires collective action from government, businesses, civil society, and individuals. By working together, we can stem the tide of plastic pollution and protect the Philippines' precious marine resources for future generations.

Let us recognize the severity of this crisis and commit to meaningful change. Our oceans, our economy, and our very way of life depend on it. The fight against plastic pollution must become a national priority, with immediate and sustained effort to address this pressing environmental challenge.",1

59,Phind Instant,"The Stark Reality of Wealth Distribution
The numbers paint a striking picture of economic disparity. As of 2018, the wealthiest 1% of Filipinos commanded 17% of national income, while the bottom 50% struggled to share just 14%.
This concentration of wealth at the top creates a pyramid of prosperity where advancement becomes increasingly difficult for those at the base.
Historical Patterns and Structural Issues
This pattern of inequality isn't new to the Philippines. Historical data reveals that the richest 20% of Filipino families (approximately 3.5 million) controlled 53% of total family income, while the poorest 80% (13.9 million) had to share the remaining 47%.
This persistent wealth gap reflects deeper structural challenges that have evolved over decades.
Root Causes of Persistent Inequality
Several interconnected factors contribute to this ongoing issue:
1.	Land Distribution Disparities
•	Skewed ownership patterns inherited from colonial times
•	Limited success of agrarian reform programs
•	Strong correlation between landlessness and poverty
2.	Labor Market Imbalances
•	Low labor force participation rates among disadvantaged groups
•	Significant disparities in human capital and productivity
•	Limited job opportunities in certain regions
3.	Regional Development Gaps
•	Widening urban-rural divides
•	Uneven distribution of economic opportunities
•	Disproportionate concentration of resources in metropolitan areas
The Pandemic's Impact
The COVID-19 crisis exposed and exacerbated existing inequalities. The World Bank reports that the pandemic:
•	Temporarily halted economic growth momentum in 2020
•	Caused unemployment spikes in sectors requiring in-person work
•	Pushed the national poverty rate up to 18.1% in 2021
•	Created uneven recovery patterns across income groups 

Breaking the Cycle
To effectively address inequality, policymakers must adopt a multi-pronged approach:

•	Implement targeted training programs
•	Focus on emerging technology skills
2.	Social Protection Enhancement
•	Strengthen unemployment insurance programs
•	Increase support for vulnerable populations
•	Develop inclusive social safety nets
3.	Economic Opportunity Creation
•	Promote entrepreneurship in underserved areas
•	Support small and medium enterprises
•	Encourage investment in lagging regions
Moving Forward
The path ahead requires sustained commitment and coordinated action. As noted by World Bank Country Director Ndiamé Diop, ""no country has managed to make this transition while maintaining high levels of inequality"".
Success will depend on:
•	Effective policy implementation
•	Consistent monitoring and evaluation

60,Phind Instant,"The Double-Edged Sword of Remittances: Understanding the Complex Role of OFWs in the Philippine Economy
The Philippines stands as a unique case in global economics, where millions of its citizens work abroad as Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), sending billions of dollars back home annually. These modern-day heroes, known as ""Bagong-Bayani"" (new heroes), contribute significantly to the nation's economic stability while facing extraordinary challenges abroad.
Their story represents both the triumph of Filipino resilience and the complexities of economic dependency.
Economic Impact and Scale
The statistics paint a picture of remarkable scale:
•	Record-high remittances reaching $36.14 billion in 2022, marking a 3.6% increase from the previous year 
•	Approximately 1.83 million OFWs working abroad as of 2021
•	Remittances account for roughly 10% of the country's GDP
•	Four in ten OFWs engage in elementary occupations, including domestic work and manual labor
Geographical Distribution and Gender Dynamics
The OFW phenomenon isn't evenly distributed globally. Most Filipino workers concentrate in Asian nations, with key destinations including:
•	Saudi Arabia
•	United Arab Emirates
•	Hong Kong
•	Kuwait
•	Singapore
•	Qatar 
A striking aspect of OFW demographics is the predominance of women in the workforce. Approximately 60% of OFWs are female, highlighting both their crucial role in the remittance economy and their particular vulnerabilities abroad.
This gender disparity becomes especially concerning when examining workplace safety and protection issues.
Challenges and Vulnerabilities
Behind the impressive remittance figures lie sobering realities of exploitation and hardship:
1.	Workplace Safety Concerns:
•	Over 24,000 cases of abuse and violations reported in 2022 alone
•	Female workers disproportionately affected, comprising 75.05% of reported cases in GCC countries
•	Particularly vulnerable under the ""kafala"" system in Middle Eastern countries
2.	Family and Social Costs:
•	Approximately 7% of Filipino households rely on OFW support
•	Seventy-five percent of households regularly receive OFW remittances 
•	Complex family dynamics and psychological impacts on children left behind
Government Response and Initiatives
The Philippine government has implemented several protective measures:
1.	Department of Migrant Workers (DMW):
•	Established emergency response protocols
•	Implemented selective deployment bans in high-risk areas
•	Enhanced coordination with diplomatic missions
2.	Policy Reforms:
•	Strengthened legal frameworks
•	Improved labor market regulations
•	Enhanced social protection programs 

Long-term Implications and Solutions
While OFW remittances remain crucial to the Philippine economy, experts advocate for a more sustainable approach:
1.	Domestic Job Creation:
•	Investment in national industrialization
•	Implementation of meaningful land reform
•	Creation of competitive domestic job opportunities 
Financial Literacy Programs:
•	Systematic support for retirement planning
•	Education on investment strategies
•	Integration of financial management skills

Conclusion
The OFW phenomenon presents a complex challenge for the Philippines. While remittances provide vital economic support, the nation must balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability. The path forward requires careful consideration of both economic strategy and humanitarian concerns. As noted by experts, the goal should be to transform remittances from a necessity into a choice, ensuring that Filipinos can seek opportunities abroad voluntarily rather than out of economic necessity.
The journey toward sustainable economic development must include robust protection mechanisms for current OFWs while building a stronger domestic economy that reduces reliance on labor export. Only through this balanced approach can the Philippines truly honor its modern-day heroes while securing a brighter future for generations to come.

61,GPT4o-mini,"For decades, the concept of federalism has been a recurring theme in the political discourse of the Philippines. Advocates argue that it holds the key to balanced regional development and empowerment, while critics warn of potential economic disparities and governance complications. As the debate continues, it is crucial to analyze the benefits, challenges, and the viability of federalism in the context of the Philippines.

Understanding Federalism

Federalism is a system of government that divides power between a central authority and regional governments. Unlike the current unitary system in the Philippines, where authority is highly centralized in Manila, federalism proposes the establishment of autonomous regions with the power to legislate, implement policies, and manage resources according to their local needs.

Countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany have successfully implemented federal systems, allowing regions to address their unique challenges while maintaining national unity. However, for the Philippines, a nation of over 7,000 islands with diverse cultural, linguistic, and economic landscapes, the transition to federalism presents both opportunities and hurdles.

The Case for Federalism

1. Regional Empowerment and Development

Proponents argue that federalism can lead to more equitable development by allowing regions to harness their own resources and craft policies tailored to their specific needs. Under the current centralized system, resource-rich but geographically distant regions, such as Mindanao, often receive disproportionately less funding and attention compared to Metro Manila. Federalism could bridge these gaps by giving regional governments control over revenue generation and expenditure.

2. Decentralization of Power

Federalism offers an opportunity to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption by limiting the concentration of power in the national government. Local leaders, being more attuned to their constituents' needs, could implement policies more effectively without excessive bureaucratic red tape.

3. Preservation of Cultural Identity

With the Philippines' rich tapestry of cultures and languages, federalism could provide a framework for greater cultural expression and preservation. Regions with distinct identities, such as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), could benefit from greater autonomy to promote their own cultural and religious practices.

4. Economic Competitiveness

A federal system may encourage healthy competition among regions, fostering economic growth and innovation. With greater autonomy, regions could attract investments by offering incentives tailored to their local economies, further diversifying the country's economic base.

Challenges of Federalism in the Philippines

1. Economic Disparities

A major concern regarding federalism is the uneven distribution of wealth among regions. Some provinces, particularly in Luzon, have thriving economies, while others, such as those in Eastern Visayas or Mindanao, struggle with poverty and underdevelopment. Critics argue that federalism could exacerbate these inequalities, with wealthier regions advancing while poorer ones fall further behind.

2. Political Dynasties and Corruption

The Philippines has long struggled with entrenched political dynasties and corruption. Critics fear that federalism could empower local elites even further, allowing them to consolidate power and resources within their regions without adequate checks and balances from the central government.

3. Implementation Costs

Transitioning to a federal system would require a complete overhaul of the current government structure, including the creation of new regional administrations, legal frameworks, and resource allocation mechanisms. This shift could be costly and time-consuming, potentially diverting funds away from crucial services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

4. National Unity Concerns

There are fears that federalism could lead to regionalism and fragmentation, weakening national unity. The prospect of autonomous regions crafting their own policies and regulations may create inconsistencies in governance and economic strategy, potentially causing tensions between regions and the central government.

Proposed Federalism Models for the Philippines

Several models have been proposed for the Philippines' shift to federalism, with the most prominent being:

The Duterte Administration's Proposed Federal Charter: This model aimed to establish 18 federated regions with a strong federal government overseeing national concerns such as defense, foreign affairs, and monetary policy.

The Bayanihan Federalism Model: Advocated by the Consultative Committee under President Duterte, this model emphasized inclusivity and social justice, with a focus on equitable resource distribution.

The Pimentel Model: Proposed by former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr., this plan divides the country into 11 federal states based on cultural and economic considerations, granting significant autonomy to each region.

Is Federalism the Right Path for the Philippines?

The answer to whether federalism is suitable for the Philippines is not a simple one. While the system promises greater regional autonomy, decentralization, and cultural preservation, it also presents risks such as increased disparities, political entrenchment, and governance inefficiencies.

The success of federalism would largely depend on meticulous planning, proper execution, and a strong legal framework to ensure accountability, transparency, and fair resource distribution. Strengthening local governance, investing in infrastructure, and addressing corruption must be prioritized to ensure a smooth transition.

Ultimately, the debate over federalism should go beyond political rhetoric and be grounded in comprehensive studies, public consultations, and a clear roadmap that considers the country's socio-political landscape. Whether through constitutional reform or incremental decentralization, the goal should be a governance model that best serves the Filipino people.

Conclusion

Federalism presents a bold vision for the Philippines—one that could empower regions, foster economic growth, and promote cultural diversity. However, without the necessary safeguards, it could also deepen existing divisions and economic inequalities. As the nation grapples with this crucial decision, it is imperative to weigh the potential benefits against the risks and determine whether federalism truly offers a path to a more prosperous and united Philippines.",1
62,GPT4o-mini,"In the Philippines, the integrity of electoral processes is paramount to sustaining a robust democracy. A critical component of this integrity is the transparency of election campaign finances, which ensures that candidates and political parties operate within legal frameworks and maintain public trust. Over the years, the Philippines has established laws and regulations aimed at promoting financial transparency during elections. However, challenges persist, necessitating continuous evaluation and reform.

Legal Framework Governing Campaign Finance

The Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881) serves as the primary legislation governing electoral processes, including campaign finance. Sections 106 to 109 of the Code mandate that every candidate and treasurer of a political party maintain detailed records of all contributions received and expenditures incurred. These records must include the amount and date of each contribution, the full name and address of contributors, and detailed accounts of expenditures. Furthermore, candidates and party treasurers are required to preserve these records for at least three years after the election and produce them for inspection upon request by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) or its authorized representatives. 
ELIBRARY

To prevent undue influence and maintain the integrity of the electoral process, the law prohibits certain entities from making contributions for partisan political activities. These entities include public or private financial institutions, natural and juridical persons operating public utilities or exploiting natural resources, those holding contracts with the government, and foreign nationals or corporations. Additionally, officials and employees in the civil service and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines are barred from making such contributions.

COMELEC's Initiatives to Enhance Transparency

In its ongoing efforts to combat vote-buying and ensure fair elections, COMELEC has implemented measures such as the ""money ban."" This policy prohibits individuals from carrying, possessing, or transporting cash amounts of ₱500,000 or more during specific periods surrounding elections. The ban aims to deter vote-buying by limiting the circulation of large sums of money that could be used to influence voters. Exceptions are made for authorized persons, such as businesspersons and disbursement officials, who can demonstrate legitimate reasons for carrying substantial amounts of cash.

To address these challenges and bolster the transparency of election campaign finances in the Philippines, several measures can be considered:

Enhancing Monitoring and Enforcement: Strengthening the capacity of COMELEC to monitor campaign finances and enforce regulations is crucial. This includes investing in technology to track contributions and expenditures in real-time and increasing the number of personnel dedicated to oversight functions.

Promoting Public Access to Information: Ensuring that campaign finance records are easily accessible to the public can enhance transparency and accountability. Publishing these records online in a user-friendly format would allow citizens and civil society organizations to scrutinize campaign finances effectively.

Implementing Stricter Penalties for Non-Compliance: Imposing more stringent penalties for candidates and parties that fail to comply with reporting requirements or engage in illicit financial activities can serve as a deterrent. This could include substantial fines, disqualification from running for office, or criminal charges in severe cases.

Encouraging Civic Engagement and Oversight: Empowering civil society organizations and the media to play a more active role in monitoring campaign finances can complement official efforts. Training and resources can be provided to these groups to enhance their capacity to detect and report irregularities.

Regularly Updating Legal Frameworks: Continuously reviewing and updating the legal frameworks governing campaign finance to address emerging challenges and close loopholes is essential. This includes adapting to new forms of fundraising and expenditure, such as digital campaigns and crowdfunding.

Conclusion

Financial transparency in election campaigns is fundamental to the health of the Philippines' democracy. While existing laws and regulations provide a solid foundation, ongoing challenges necessitate continuous efforts to strengthen enforcement, enhance public access to information, and promote accountability. By implementing these measures, the Philippines can work towards more transparent and fair elections, thereby reinforcing public trust in the democratic process.",1
63,GPT4o-mini,"Mental health remains a critical yet often overlooked issue in the Philippines. Despite the passing of the Mental Health Act in 2018, which aimed to integrate mental health services into the country's public health system, deep-rooted stigma continues to hinder progress. Societal perceptions, cultural beliefs, and economic barriers all contribute to the difficulty of addressing mental health concerns openly. As the nation grapples with increasing cases of depression, anxiety, and suicide, it becomes imperative to challenge the stigma and create a more supportive environment for those struggling with their mental well-being.

The Cultural Stigma Surrounding Mental Health

In Filipino culture, mental health issues are frequently misunderstood and, in many cases, dismissed entirely. Traditional values that emphasize resilience, family reputation, and religious faith often discourage individuals from seeking professional help. The concept of ""hiya"" (shame) plays a significant role in perpetuating silence, as individuals fear being perceived as weak or burdening their families with their struggles.

Additionally, there remains a prevailing belief that mental health problems are simply a result of a lack of faith or personal weakness. Phrases such as ""Dasal lang yan"" (Just pray) or ""Kaya mo yan"" (You can do it) reflect the cultural inclination to downplay psychological struggles and promote a ""grin and bear it"" mentality. While faith and perseverance are valuable coping mechanisms, they should not replace professional intervention when necessary.

The Role of Media and Misinformation

Media representation in the Philippines has also contributed to the stigma surrounding mental health. Television shows and films often portray individuals with mental illnesses as violent, unstable, or comical, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. These portrayals contribute to public fear and misunderstanding, discouraging those who need help from stepping forward.

Social media, while a potential tool for awareness, can also spread misinformation about mental health. Misinformed advice, self-diagnosis, and stigmatizing language can further alienate those seeking help and reinforce misconceptions within the community.

Barriers to Mental Health Care

Even for those who recognize the importance of mental health, access to professional help remains a significant challenge. In many rural areas, mental health services are either nonexistent or severely lacking, forcing individuals to travel long distances to seek care. The cost of therapy and psychiatric medications can be prohibitive for lower-income families, making mental health care a privilege rather than a right.

Additionally, there is a shortage of trained mental health professionals in the Philippines. According to the Department of Health, there is a stark disparity between the number of individuals requiring mental health services and the available professionals to meet those needs. This shortage leads to long waiting times, inadequate treatment, and further discouragement from seeking help.

Steps Toward Breaking the Stigma

Addressing the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach involving government intervention, community support, and educational initiatives.

1. Government Initiatives and Policy Implementation

While the passage of the Mental Health Act was a significant step forward, full implementation and funding remain crucial. The government must ensure that mental health services are integrated into primary health care centers nationwide, making them accessible to all Filipinos. Training for healthcare providers in mental health awareness and treatment should be prioritized to equip them with the necessary skills to identify and address mental health issues effectively.

2. Public Awareness Campaigns

Awareness campaigns can play a vital role in normalizing conversations about mental health. Social media influencers, celebrities, and local leaders can use their platforms to educate the public and share personal experiences, helping to break down stereotypes and encourage open discussions. National campaigns such as ""#UsapTayo"" (Let's Talk) have already made strides in this area, but more efforts are needed to reach all communities.

3. Incorporating Mental Health Education

Educational institutions should integrate mental health awareness into their curriculum. Teaching students about mental well-being, coping mechanisms, and the importance of seeking help can foster a culture of acceptance and empathy from an early age. Guidance counselors should also receive specialized training to support students facing mental health challenges.

4. Community-Based Support Systems

Grassroots initiatives, such as mental health support groups and peer counseling programs, can provide accessible and relatable support for those in need. Barangay health workers and community leaders should be trained to recognize signs of mental distress and offer initial support or referrals to appropriate services.

5. Encouraging Workplace Mental Health Programs

Employers should be encouraged to implement mental health policies in the workplace. Providing mental health days, offering employee assistance programs, and fostering a supportive work environment can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being.

Moving Forward

Breaking the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires collective effort and a shift in cultural attitudes. By fostering open conversations, increasing access to mental health services, and challenging harmful stereotypes, the country can create a more compassionate and understanding society. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and acknowledging this reality is the first step toward meaningful change.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a Philippines where individuals feel empowered to seek help without fear of judgment, where mental well-being is prioritized, and where no one has to suffer in silence.",1
64,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines, with its rapidly growing urban centers, faces significant challenges in urban congestion and housing shortages. These issues not only hinder economic progress but also impact the quality of life for millions of Filipinos.

The Urbanization Surge

In recent decades, the Philippines has experienced a notable shift from rural to urban living. Cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have become magnets for individuals seeking better employment opportunities and access to services. However, this rapid urbanization has led to overcrowded cities, strained infrastructure, and a burgeoning demand for housing.

The Traffic Conundrum

Metro Manila, the nation's capital region, epitomizes the challenges of urban congestion. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimates that the Philippines loses approximately Php 3.5 billion daily due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila, amounting to Php 1.27 trillion annually. This congestion not only results in lost productivity but also contributes to environmental degradation and increased stress among commuters.

Housing Shortfalls

The surge in urban migration has outpaced the development of affordable housing. The Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) estimates that there are about 1.4 million informal settler families nationwide, with 40% residing in Metro Manila. The total housing units needed this year are projected to reach 6.3 million, with private sector estimates suggesting that the required housing units could reach 12.5 million by 2030. This shortage has led to the proliferation of informal settlements, where residents often lack access to basic services and are vulnerable to environmental hazards.

Government Initiatives

Recognizing the gravity of the housing crisis, the government launched the Pambansang Pabahay Para sa Pilipino Program (4PH) in September 2022. The program aims to build 1 million housing units annually to address the backlog of 6.5 million units. As of April 2023, approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million housing sites have been initiated under this program. Additionally, in July 2023, President Bongbong Marcos issued Executive Order No. 34, directing all National Government Agencies and Instrumentalities, including Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), as well as Local Government Units (LGUs), to submit a detailed inventory of suitable lands for housing to support the program's implementation.

Innovative Urban Planning: The 15-Minute City

To combat urban congestion, some developers are embracing the concept of the ""15-Minute City."" This urban planning model envisions that all essential services—workplaces, schools, healthcare, and recreational facilities—are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from residents' homes. In Metro Manila, developments like MyTown, a network of dormitories near major business districts, exemplify this approach. Residents benefit from reduced commute times, leading to improved productivity and well-being.

The Way Forward

Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multifaceted approach:

Infrastructure Development: Investing in efficient public transportation systems can alleviate traffic congestion and reduce the reliance on private vehicles.

Affordable Housing: Accelerating the construction of affordable housing units and ensuring their strategic location can help accommodate the growing urban population.

Urban Decentralization: Encouraging the development of secondary cities can distribute economic activities more evenly and reduce the pressure on major urban centers.

Sustainable Urban Planning: Implementing concepts like the 15-Minute City can enhance the quality of urban life and promote environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, while the challenges of urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines are significant, strategic planning, robust government initiatives, and innovative urban development models offer a pathway to more livable and sustainable cities for future generations.",1
65,GPT4o-mini,"Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges facing the Philippines today. As an archipelago with over 7,600 islands, the country is uniquely vulnerable to the devastating effects of plastic waste, which threatens marine ecosystems, public health, and economic stability. Despite numerous initiatives and policies aimed at addressing the issue, plastic pollution continues to escalate, demanding urgent and collective action.

The Scope of the Problem

The Philippines is among the world's top contributors to plastic waste, with studies indicating that the country generates approximately 2.7 million tons of plastic waste annually. Alarmingly, around 20% of this plastic ends up in the ocean. The nation's reliance on single-use plastics, such as sachets and plastic bags, exacerbates the crisis. These products are deeply embedded in Filipino culture and consumer habits due to their affordability and convenience, but they come at an immense environmental cost.

One of the key contributors to the plastic waste problem is the lack of efficient waste management infrastructure. In many areas, particularly in urban centers and coastal communities, improper disposal practices, such as open dumping and burning, are prevalent. The absence of proper recycling facilities and segregation practices further complicates efforts to mitigate the crisis.

Impact on Marine Ecosystems

As an island nation, the Philippines boasts rich marine biodiversity, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves that serve as habitats for countless species. However, plastic pollution poses a severe threat to these ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement, which can result in injury or death. Microplastics, tiny plastic particles that originate from larger debris breaking down, have also infiltrated the food chain, posing potential health risks to humans.

Additionally, plastic waste contributes to the destruction of coral reefs, a vital source of livelihood for millions of Filipinos who depend on fishing and tourism. Coral reefs suffocated by plastic debris experience reduced growth rates and increased susceptibility to disease, further threatening the country's food security and economic sustainability.

Public Health Concerns

Beyond environmental impacts, plastic pollution has significant implications for public health in the Philippines. Poorly managed plastic waste often clogs drainage systems, leading to widespread flooding during the rainy season. Floodwaters can become breeding grounds for diseases such as dengue fever and leptospirosis, posing severe health risks to communities.

Moreover, the burning of plastic waste, a common practice in many rural and urban areas, releases toxic chemicals into the air. These pollutants, including dioxins and furans, are known to cause respiratory diseases, hormonal imbalances, and even cancer.

Government Initiatives and Challenges

In response to the growing crisis, the Philippine government has introduced various policies and programs aimed at reducing plastic pollution. The Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (Republic Act 9003) was a landmark legislation designed to promote waste reduction, recycling, and proper disposal. However, implementation at the local level has been inconsistent, hindered by a lack of funding, enforcement, and public awareness.

More recently, several local governments have enacted ordinances banning single-use plastics, such as plastic straws and bags. While these efforts are commendable, they often face resistance from businesses and consumers who rely on these products for their daily needs.

Corporate Responsibility and Consumer Action

The private sector plays a crucial role in combating plastic pollution in the Philippines. Major corporations, particularly those in the food and beverage industry, are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable packaging alternatives and reduce their plastic footprint. Some companies have responded by implementing take-back programs, promoting reusable packaging, and investing in biodegradable alternatives.

Consumers, too, have a role to play in addressing the crisis. Small changes in daily habits, such as using reusable bags, bottles, and containers, can collectively make a significant impact. Public education and awareness campaigns are essential in encouraging behavioral changes and fostering a culture of environmental responsibility.

Innovative Solutions and the Path Forward

While the plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines is daunting, there are innovative solutions that offer hope. Community-based recycling initiatives, such as ""eco-bricks"" made from compressed plastic waste, provide creative ways to repurpose plastics and reduce landfill contributions. Additionally, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and advocacy groups have been instrumental in spearheading beach clean-ups, policy advocacy, and awareness campaigns.

Technology and scientific research can also play a role in addressing the crisis. Emerging solutions, such as biodegradable plastics derived from natural materials and plastic-eating bacteria, hold promise in reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste.

Conclusion: A Call to Collective Action

The plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach that involves government action, corporate responsibility, and public participation. Strengthening waste management systems, enforcing existing regulations, and fostering innovation are essential steps toward a cleaner and more sustainable future.

Every Filipino has a role to play in combating plastic pollution, whether through responsible consumption, advocacy, or community involvement. By working together, the Philippines can protect its precious natural resources and ensure a healthier, more sustainable environment for future generations.",1
66,GPT4o-mini,"Bridging the Divide: The Persistent Struggle Against Income Inequality in the Philippines
Introduction
The Philippines, a nation of over 110 million people, boasts a dynamic economy and a rapidly growing middle class. However, beneath the surface of economic growth lies a persistent and widening gap between the rich and the poor. Income inequality in the country remains one of the highest in Southeast Asia, manifesting in disparities in wealth distribution, education, employment opportunities, and access to basic services. Despite numerous efforts by successive administrations, the divide continues to loom large, preventing millions from escaping the cycle of poverty. Addressing this issue is crucial not just for economic progress but also for social stability and long-term development.
Understanding the Roots of Income Inequality
Income inequality in the Philippines is rooted in several historical and structural factors:
1.	Colonial Legacy The country’s colonial past under Spanish and American rule contributed to the concentration of wealth and land ownership in the hands of a few elite families. Large haciendas and corporate conglomerates continue to dominate key industries, leaving little room for wealth redistribution among the lower and middle classes.
2.	Unequal Land Distribution The agrarian sector remains one of the most unequal in the country. While land reform programs have been enacted, many farmers still lack ownership of the land they till, leading to high levels of rural poverty. Landlords, often politically influential, have managed to retain large tracts of land, preventing small farmers from achieving economic independence.
3.	Educational Disparities Education is often heralded as the great equalizer, yet in the Philippines, access to quality education remains uneven. Wealthier families can afford private education, leading to better job opportunities, while public schools struggle with underfunding, overcrowding, and outdated curricula. This educational gap limits upward mobility for the poor.
4.	Job Market Inequities The labor market in the Philippines is highly segmented. While multinational companies and urban centers offer higher wages and benefits, rural areas suffer from underemployment and informal work arrangements that provide little job security. Many Filipinos resort to working overseas as Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) due to the lack of well-paying jobs at home, further exacerbating economic disparities.
5.	Corruption and Political Dynasties The intersection of politics and wealth has perpetuated income inequality. Political dynasties dominate local and national governance, often prioritizing policies that benefit their businesses and interests over those of the general population. Corruption also siphons funds away from crucial social programs, limiting government efforts to alleviate poverty.
The Consequences of Income Inequality
The widening gap between the rich and the poor has far-reaching consequences:
1.	Persistent Poverty Despite economic growth, a significant portion of the population remains below the poverty line. The lack of opportunities for upward mobility means many Filipinos struggle to afford basic needs such as food, healthcare, and education.
2.	Social Unrest and Crime Economic disparity breeds discontent, which can manifest in social unrest, crime, and even insurgencies. The rise of militant groups in impoverished regions highlights how economic frustration can fuel conflict and instability.
3.	Limited Economic Growth When wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, overall consumer spending is limited, stifling domestic economic growth. A more equitable distribution of income would boost demand and create a more robust economy.
4.	Brain Drain and Migration Many skilled workers choose to leave the Philippines in search of better opportunities abroad. While remittances from OFWs contribute significantly to the economy, the long-term effect is a depletion of the country’s talent pool, hampering innovation and industrial growth.
Addressing the Issue: Steps Toward a More Equitable Society
Tackling income inequality requires a multi-faceted approach that includes policy reforms, economic restructuring, and social interventions. Some key strategies include:
1.	Progressive Taxation and Wealth Redistribution Implementing a more progressive tax system can help redistribute wealth more equitably. Higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy and large corporations, combined with increased public spending on social services, can help level the playing field.
2.	Education and Skills Development Improving access to quality education and vocational training can help bridge the skills gap and provide better job opportunities for lower-income Filipinos. Government initiatives that offer free or subsidized higher education should be expanded and properly implemented.
3.	Strengthening Labor Rights and Wages Ensuring that workers receive fair wages and benefits is essential in reducing income disparities. Raising the minimum wage, regulating contractual employment, and enforcing labor laws can create a more inclusive labor market.
4.	Land Reform and Rural Development Genuine land reform programs that empower small farmers can alleviate rural poverty. Investing in rural infrastructure, agricultural technology, and access to credit can help small-scale farmers increase productivity and earnings.
5.	Anti-Corruption Measures and Political Reforms Tackling corruption and breaking political dynasties will enable more equitable governance. Strengthening anti-corruption agencies and ensuring transparency in government transactions can redirect public funds to poverty alleviation programs.
6.	Support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting SMEs can help create jobs and distribute wealth more evenly. Providing access to financing, training, and technology for small businesses can foster economic inclusivity.
Conclusion
Income inequality remains one of the most pressing challenges in the Philippines. While the country has made economic progress, the benefits of growth have not been evenly shared. Addressing this issue requires bold reforms, strong political will, and a commitment to inclusive development. By investing in education, labor rights, rural development, and governance reforms, the Philippines can move toward a more equitable society where prosperity is accessible to all, not just the privileged few. The time for action is now—because a fairer economy is not just a moral imperative but also a key to sustainable progress.

67,GPT4o-mini,"The Backbone of the Philippine Economy: The Role of OFWs

The Philippines is known for its vibrant culture, rich history, and breathtaking landscapes. However, one of its most significant contributions to the global workforce is its Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). These modern-day heroes have long been the backbone of the country's economy, significantly impacting the nation's financial stability and growth. Their sacrifices and hard work abroad have kept the economy afloat, but it is crucial to understand both the benefits and challenges associated with this phenomenon.

The Economic Contribution of OFWs

One of the most tangible impacts of OFWs on the Philippine economy is their remittances. According to data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), remittances from overseas workers contribute approximately 9% to 10% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In 2022 alone, cash remittances reached an estimated $36 billion, an essential lifeline for millions of Filipino families.

These remittances fuel various sectors of the economy. A significant portion is spent on household consumption, including food, education, healthcare, and housing. The steady influx of foreign currency stabilizes the Philippine peso and enhances the nation's purchasing power. In turn, this boosts local businesses, from small enterprises to large industries, creating a ripple effect that sustains economic activity.

Apart from household consumption, remittances support real estate investments and financial markets. Many OFWs invest in properties, increasing demand for housing and contributing to real estate development. Others save and invest in banks, cooperatives, and stock markets, helping sustain financial institutions and increasing liquidity in the economy.

OFWs and Job Creation

The economic benefits of OFW remittances extend beyond the families who receive them. Increased spending drives demand for goods and services, generating employment opportunities in various industries. The construction sector, for example, has grown significantly due to housing projects financed by OFW families. The retail and education sectors also benefit from the increased spending capacity of OFW-dependent households.

Moreover, the entrepreneurial spirit among OFWs has been on the rise. Many workers who return to the Philippines choose to invest in small businesses, contributing to local job creation. Franchises, retail stores, and service-based businesses often emerge from the capital accumulated through years of working abroad. The success of such enterprises helps diversify the Philippine economy and fosters economic independence among returning OFWs.

Social Costs and Challenges

While the economic contributions of OFWs are immense, there are undeniable social costs that come with labor migration. One of the most pressing issues is the impact on families. Many OFWs leave behind children, spouses, and elderly parents in pursuit of better financial opportunities. The prolonged separation often leads to emotional distress, weakened family bonds, and social adjustment challenges, particularly among children.

Additionally, the reliance on foreign employment poses risks to the country's workforce development. The ""brain drain"" phenomenon—where highly skilled professionals such as doctors, nurses, and engineers seek opportunities abroad—results in labor shortages in crucial sectors. This exodus leaves gaps in the Philippine healthcare, engineering, and education industries, affecting the quality of services in these fields.

Labor rights abuses and exploitation are also major concerns for OFWs. Reports of maltreatment, wage theft, and unsafe working conditions continue to surface, particularly among domestic workers and construction laborers in some Middle Eastern and Asian countries. Despite government efforts to strengthen protection policies and bilateral agreements, many OFWs still face risks in foreign lands.

Government Initiatives and Policies

Recognizing the importance of OFWs to the economy, the Philippine government has implemented various programs and policies to support overseas workers. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) provide services such as pre-departure orientation, legal assistance, and reintegration programs.

The Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-asa (BP2) program encourages OFWs to invest in their home provinces, promoting local development and reducing urban congestion. Financial literacy campaigns and investment opportunities are also being introduced to help OFWs manage their earnings wisely and secure their future beyond overseas employment.

The Future of OFWs in the Philippine Economy

While OFWs will remain a crucial pillar of the Philippine economy for the foreseeable future, it is essential to work towards long-term strategies that reduce dependency on labor migration. Sustainable job creation within the country, improvements in wages, and enhanced labor protections can provide more opportunities for Filipinos to thrive locally without seeking employment abroad.

The continued development of industries such as information technology, business process outsourcing (BPO), and manufacturing can create high-quality jobs and lessen the need for Filipinos to work overseas. Furthermore, investments in education and skills training will equip the workforce with the capabilities needed to compete in a rapidly evolving job market.

Conclusion

OFWs are undeniably a lifeline of the Philippine economy, driving household incomes, business growth, and financial stability. However, their contributions come at a social cost that must be addressed through comprehensive policies and sustainable economic development. While labor migration has been an economic savior, the ultimate goal should be to create an environment where Filipinos can achieve prosperity within their homeland. By fostering local industries, ensuring fair wages, and investing in long-term development, the Philippines can build a future where its people no longer need to seek opportunities abroad but can thrive in their own country.",1
68,GPT4o-mini,"Ensuring Food Security in the Philippines: Challenges and the Road Ahead
Food security is a fundamental issue in the Philippines, a country rich in agricultural resources yet grappling with hunger, malnutrition, and economic instability. As a nation that relies heavily on both domestic production and imports, ensuring that every Filipino has consistent access to affordable, nutritious food remains a complex challenge. With factors such as climate change, supply chain disruptions, and socio-economic inequalities influencing food security, it is crucial to examine the current landscape and explore solutions that can lead to sustainable and resilient food systems.
The State of Food Security in the Philippines
According to the Global Hunger Index, the Philippines ranks in the middle range of countries experiencing moderate to serious hunger issues. Despite being an agricultural nation, food insecurity remains a prevalent concern, particularly in rural and impoverished urban areas. The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that about 9.3% of Filipino families experienced moderate to severe food insecurity in recent years, highlighting the pressing need for strategic interventions.
The country's food security is evaluated based on four key dimensions: availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability. While food is available through domestic agriculture and imports, accessibility remains a major challenge due to economic constraints. Rising food prices, lack of income opportunities, and inadequate infrastructure hinder Filipinos from obtaining a sufficient and nutritious diet. Utilization is affected by health and sanitation concerns, with malnutrition and food wastage posing significant issues. Lastly, stability is threatened by external shocks such as typhoons, pandemics, and global market disruptions.
Challenges to Food Security
1.	Climate Change and Natural Disasters The Philippines is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing an average of 20 typhoons annually, as well as rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns. These environmental changes adversely affect agricultural production, leading to decreased crop yields, soil degradation, and increased pest infestations. Coastal communities, which rely on fishing for their livelihood and food sources, also face declining fish stocks due to overfishing and oceanic changes.
2.	Dependence on Food Imports While the country produces staple crops such as rice, corn, and coconuts, it remains reliant on imports for food security, especially for rice. The Rice Tariffication Law, implemented in 2019, opened the market to imported rice to stabilize supply and prices, but this has also exposed local farmers to increased competition. The lack of self-sufficiency in food production makes the Philippines susceptible to global supply chain disruptions and price fluctuations.
3.	Agricultural Productivity and Infrastructure Gaps Despite agriculture being a significant sector, it is often characterized by low productivity, outdated farming techniques, and inadequate infrastructure. Many farmers still depend on traditional methods with limited access to modern technology, fertilizers, and irrigation systems. Furthermore, poor transportation networks and storage facilities contribute to post-harvest losses, reducing the availability of food in the market.
4.	Economic Disparities and Poverty Food insecurity is closely linked to poverty, with millions of Filipinos struggling to afford a nutritious diet. The economic gap between rural and urban populations means that farmers, who produce food, often cannot afford to buy enough of it for themselves. Low wages, underemployment, and inflation exacerbate this issue, limiting people's purchasing power and access to food.
5.	Policy and Governance Issues While the government has introduced various programs to address food security, challenges remain in implementation and consistency. Bureaucratic inefficiencies, corruption, and lack of coordination between national and local agencies have hindered long-term agricultural development and food security initiatives.
Strategies for Achieving Food Security
To ensure long-term food security, the Philippines must adopt a multi-faceted approach involving policy reforms, technological advancements, and community-based solutions.
1.	Strengthening Agricultural Resilience Investing in climate-resilient farming practices, such as diversified cropping systems, organic agriculture, and the use of drought-resistant crop varieties, can help mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. Expanding irrigation systems and promoting agroforestry can further enhance sustainability.
2.	Enhancing Local Food Production Encouraging urban farming, backyard gardening, and aquaculture can supplement food sources and reduce dependency on imports. Providing incentives and subsidies to local farmers can boost productivity and ensure fair market competition against imported goods.
3.	Improving Agricultural Infrastructure and Technology The government and private sector should work together to modernize agricultural infrastructure, including roads, storage facilities, and processing plants. Investing in mechanization, precision farming, and digital agriculture can increase efficiency and reduce post-harvest losses.
4.	Empowering Farmers and Fisherfolk Implementing capacity-building programs, access to affordable credit, and fair-trade policies can help farmers and fisherfolk gain better livelihoods. Strengthening agricultural cooperatives can also enhance bargaining power and access to markets.
5.	Promoting Sustainable Food Policies The government should implement policies that prioritize local food production, land reform, and responsible trade agreements. Strengthening safety nets such as food aid programs, school feeding initiatives, and community food banks can provide immediate relief for vulnerable populations.
6.	Addressing Economic and Social Inequality Ensuring that all Filipinos have a stable income source, affordable healthcare, and education will contribute to long-term food security. Expanding social protection programs and minimum wage adjustments can improve food accessibility.
Conclusion
The path toward food security in the Philippines is complex but achievable through strategic planning, innovation, and collective action. As a nation rich in natural and human resources, the Philippines has the potential to build a resilient and sustainable food system. By addressing the root causes of food insecurity—climate change, economic disparities, agricultural inefficiencies, and policy gaps—the country can work towards a future where no Filipino goes hungry. Ensuring food security is not just a government responsibility but a shared duty among policymakers, farmers, businesses, and consumers alike. Only through a collaborative approach can the Philippines secure a stable and nourishing future for all.",1
69,GPT4o-mini,"The Accessibility of Technology in the Philippines: Bridging the Digital Divide
The Philippines, an archipelagic nation of more than 7,600 islands, has made significant strides in technological advancements over the past decades. With a growing economy and an increasing number of Filipinos embracing the digital world, technology plays a crucial role in education, commerce, healthcare, and daily life. However, despite these advancements, challenges persist in ensuring equitable access to technology across all sectors of society. From the urban centers of Metro Manila to the remote provinces of Mindanao, the disparities in technology accessibility reflect broader socioeconomic inequalities. Addressing these issues is critical for fostering inclusive growth and empowering all Filipinos in the digital age.
The State of Technology Access in the Philippines
According to the latest data from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), internet penetration in the country has significantly increased, with over 76 million Filipinos actively using the internet as of 2023. The rapid adoption of mobile technology, largely driven by affordable smartphones and prepaid mobile data plans, has enabled millions of people to connect online. Social media usage is also among the highest in the world, with Filipinos spending an average of four hours a day on platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube.
Despite these promising figures, challenges remain in making technology universally accessible. Internet speed and reliability remain significant concerns. According to the Speedtest Global Index, the Philippines ranks lower than its Southeast Asian neighbors in average broadband and mobile internet speeds. Many rural communities still lack access to stable and affordable internet, limiting their opportunities for education, work, and e-commerce.
Barriers to Technological Accessibility
1. Infrastructure Limitations
One of the biggest hurdles to widespread technology access is inadequate infrastructure. While major cities like Manila, Cebu, and Davao enjoy fiber-optic broadband connections and 5G networks, remote and underserved areas continue to rely on slow and expensive satellite or mobile data connections. The geography of the Philippines poses additional challenges, as the scattered islands make nationwide broadband coverage a logistical and financial challenge.
2. Economic Disparities
Access to technology is also deeply linked to economic status. The cost of smartphones, laptops, and internet subscriptions remains prohibitively high for low-income families. While government initiatives such as the Free Public Wi-Fi Program aim to bridge this gap, the quality and reach of these services are often inconsistent.
3. Digital Literacy and Education
Even when technology is available, many Filipinos—especially older generations and those in marginalized communities—lack the digital literacy skills needed to maximize its benefits. Basic skills such as navigating online platforms, identifying misinformation, and protecting oneself from cyber threats are essential in today's digital world. Schools and community programs play a crucial role in equipping citizens with these competencies, but more structured efforts are needed.
4. Government and Private Sector Involvement
While the Philippine government has launched initiatives to expand technology access, bureaucratic inefficiencies and regulatory challenges often slow down progress. The private sector, particularly telecommunications companies like PLDT and Globe, continues to expand coverage and develop innovative solutions, but affordability and reliability remain concerns. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) could accelerate improvements in connectivity and technological accessibility.
Bridging the Digital Divide
To ensure that every Filipino benefits from technological advancements, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. Here are some key strategies to bridge the digital divide:
1. Expanding and Upgrading Infrastructure
Investing in digital infrastructure is crucial to improving connectivity across the country. The Philippine government’s National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to establish a fiber backbone that connects far-flung areas, but faster implementation and greater private sector involvement are needed to accelerate progress.
2. Affordable Technology and Internet Access
Policies that encourage price competition among telecom providers can help lower the cost of internet access. Additionally, providing subsidies or financing options for low-income families to purchase digital devices can make technology more accessible.
3. Strengthening Digital Literacy Programs
The Department of Education (DepEd) and Commission on Higher Education (CHED) should incorporate digital literacy into school curricula, ensuring that students graduate with essential tech skills. NGOs and community-based programs should also receive support to teach digital literacy to older populations and disadvantaged communities.
4. Encouraging Local Innovation
Startups and local tech companies should be encouraged to develop solutions tailored to the needs of Filipino consumers. Government grants and incentives for tech innovation can drive digital entrepreneurship and create more locally relevant applications and services.
5. Cybersecurity and Digital Rights Awareness
With greater connectivity comes the need for better cybersecurity awareness and protection of digital rights. The government and private sector must work together to implement stricter data privacy laws, provide cybersecurity education, and ensure that Filipinos can navigate the internet safely.
Conclusion
The accessibility of technology in the Philippines has improved significantly, but gaps remain, particularly for rural and economically disadvantaged populations. To fully harness the benefits of the digital age, the government, private sector, and civil society must work together to create sustainable solutions. By investing in infrastructure, improving affordability, strengthening digital literacy, fostering local innovation, and ensuring cybersecurity, the country can take meaningful steps toward a more inclusive and technologically empowered society.
As the world continues to evolve digitally, ensuring equal access to technology is not just an economic necessity but also a matter of social justice. The Philippines has the potential to become a leader in digital inclusivity, provided that efforts to bridge the digital divide are prioritized and sustained.",1
70,GPT4o-mini,"The Power of the Youth: Shaping the Future of Philippine Politics

The Philippines, a nation known for its dynamic political landscape, has always placed significant emphasis on the role of its youth in nation-building. With over 30% of the country’s population composed of individuals aged 15 to 30, young Filipinos hold the key to shaping the country’s political future. Historically, youth activism has played a crucial role in political movements, and today, as the digital era continues to revolutionize information dissemination, their impact is greater than ever.

The Historical Influence of the Youth

The youth have long been at the forefront of Philippine political movements. From the Propaganda Movement of the late 19th century, led by young intellectuals like José Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and Graciano López Jaena, to the First Quarter Storm in the 1970s, young Filipinos have consistently fought for democracy, freedom, and social justice.

One of the most notable moments in Philippine history that showcased the power of the youth was the 1986 People Power Revolution. Students, young professionals, and activists filled the streets of EDSA, demanding an end to Ferdinand Marcos' dictatorship. Their unwavering resolve, fueled by a deep desire for democratic reform, played a significant role in toppling an authoritarian regime.

Fast forward to the 21st century, the youth continue to be vocal in political and social movements. Whether it be through protests, volunteer efforts, or social media activism, their passion for change remains unwavering.

The Digital Age and Political Awareness

Social media has transformed the way young Filipinos engage in politics. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become battlegrounds for political discourse, enabling young voters to access information, engage in discussions, and mobilize support for their advocacies. In recent elections, digital campaigns have played a vital role in influencing voters, particularly the youth, who rely heavily on online sources for news and information.

However, the rise of social media has also posed challenges, such as the spread of misinformation and political propaganda. Despite this, many young Filipinos have taken it upon themselves to fact-check and counter fake news, proving that they are not just passive consumers but active participants in the political sphere.

The Youth Vote: A Game Changer

The role of the youth in Philippine elections cannot be overstated. In the 2022 national elections, millions of young voters registered and turned out to vote, recognizing their power in shaping the country's leadership. This surge in youth participation highlighted their growing awareness of their civic duty and their desire to elect leaders who truly represent their ideals and aspirations.

Organizations and youth-led movements such as #Halalan2022 and #VoteSafePH actively encouraged voter registration and education, ensuring that young Filipinos were well-informed before heading to the polls. The result? A more politically engaged youth population determined to hold leaders accountable.

Challenges and Barriers to Youth Political Participation

Despite their enthusiasm, young Filipinos face several obstacles when it comes to political participation. One major challenge is the perception that their voices are not taken seriously. Many traditional politicians dismiss the concerns of the youth, labeling them as too idealistic or inexperienced. This, however, has not deterred young leaders from stepping up and making their presence felt.

Another challenge is political dynasties, which continue to dominate Philippine politics. These entrenched family networks make it difficult for new and young politicians to break through, often discouraging fresh and independent voices from emerging.

Furthermore, economic difficulties hinder full political engagement. Many young Filipinos struggle with financial instability, making political involvement a secondary priority to their immediate needs. Nevertheless, this has not stopped them from finding ways to contribute, whether through grassroots movements, volunteer work, or digital activism.

The Rise of Young Leaders

Despite these challenges, there is a growing number of young leaders making their mark in Philippine politics. Several youth-oriented organizations and advocacy groups are pushing for policies that directly address issues affecting young Filipinos, such as education reform, employment opportunities, climate action, and human rights.

Additionally, more young politicians are taking up government positions, challenging the traditional political landscape. Figures such as Vico Sotto, a young and progressive mayor, have demonstrated that youth-led governance can bring about tangible and positive change.

The Future of Philippine Politics

The future of the Philippines lies in the hands of its youth. With their increasing awareness, digital savvy, and unwavering passion for change, young Filipinos are poised to redefine the country’s political landscape. The challenge now is for them to remain engaged, vigilant, and proactive in holding their leaders accountable.

Political participation should not end at the ballot box. The youth must continue to engage in civic discourse, advocate for policies that align with their values, and push for greater representation in government. The call for meaningful change is loud, and with the youth leading the charge, there is hope for a brighter, more progressive Philippines.

As Rizal once said, ""The youth is the hope of the fatherland."" Today, more than ever, this statement rings true. The challenge now is for young Filipinos to rise to the occasion, not just as voters or activists, but as true leaders of the nation.",1
71,Llama3.2,"The concept of federalism has been debated in the Philippines for decades, with some arguing that it is the only way to address the country's deep-seated regional and socio-economic disparities. The idea of a more decentralized system of government, where power is divided between a central authority and regional governments, has gained significant traction in recent years.

The current Philippine government, led by President Rodrigo Duterte, has been exploring options for federalism as a way to address the country's long-standing issues with regional autonomy and representation. The proposal aims to create a more inclusive and equitable system of governance that recognizes the diversity of regional cultures, languages, and interests.

One of the primary arguments in favor of federalism is its ability to address regional disparities. Under the current system, regional development is largely controlled by the central government, with limited autonomy for local governments to make decisions about their own affairs. Federalism, on the other hand, would grant more power to regional governments, allowing them to make decisions that are tailored to their specific needs and circumstances.

Another key benefit of federalism is its ability to promote greater representation and participation in governance. Under a federal system, regional governments would have a stronger presence in national politics, ensuring that local voices are heard and represented at the highest levels of government. This would be particularly beneficial for marginalized communities, who often feel left behind by central government policies.

However, there are also concerns about the potential drawbacks of federalism. Some argue that it could lead to greater fragmentation and instability, as regional governments may have competing interests and priorities. Others worry that a more decentralized system of government could create bureaucratic inefficiencies and duplication of efforts.

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that the benefits of federalism outweigh its costs. For example, a study by the University of the Philippines found that a federal system would lead to greater regional growth and development, as well as increased investment in public goods and services.

Another key proponent of federalism is Senator Manny Pacquiao, who has been a strong advocate for the concept throughout his career. Pacquiao argues that a federal system would allow the country to better address its deep-seated socio-economic disparities, and to create more opportunities for economic growth and development.

However, not all Filipinos are convinced of the benefits of federalism. Some argue that it could lead to greater regionalism and fragmentation, undermining the country's national unity and cohesion. Others worry about the potential costs of implementing a new system of government, particularly in terms of infrastructure and institutional capacity.

In conclusion, federalism is an idea whose time has come in the Philippines. The current system of governance has failed many Filipinos, particularly those living outside of Manila, who feel left behind by central government policies. A more decentralized system of government would allow for greater regional autonomy, representation, and participation, addressing the country's deep-seated socio-economic disparities.

While there are certainly challenges to implementing federalism, many experts believe that its benefits outweigh its costs. The future of Philippine governance is at a crossroads, and it is time for the country to consider a new era of governance that reflects the needs and aspirations of all Filipinos.",1
72,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is set to hold another historic presidential election, one that promises to be a defining moment for the country's democracy. However, amidst all the hype and excitement, a more pressing concern looms over the campaign trail - the lack of transparency in election campaign financing.

For decades, the Philippines has been plagued by a culture of corruption and cronyism in politics. The country's elections have long been marred by allegations of vote-rigging, bribery, and other forms of electoral malfeasance. One of the major contributing factors to this problem is the lack of transparency in election campaign financing.

Under current laws, politicians are allowed to raise funds from a variety of sources, including donations from individuals, corporations, and special interest groups. However, these campaigns often operate in the shadows, with little disclosure about their funding sources or expenditures.

This lack of transparency creates an environment that fosters corruption and cronyism. Politicians may feel pressure to accept donations from certain groups or individuals in order to secure support for their campaign, even if those donations come with strings attached. This can lead to a situation where politicians are beholden to powerful interests rather than the people they represent.

Furthermore, the lack of transparency in election campaign financing makes it difficult to hold politicians accountable for their actions. Without clear disclosure about who is funding their campaigns and how that money is being spent, voters have no way of knowing whether they are voting for a candidate who truly represents their interests or one who is beholden to special interests.

To address this problem, the Philippines needs to implement more robust campaign finance regulations. This could include requirements for candidates to disclose their donors and expenditures in real-time, as well as limits on the amount of money that can be raised and spent by each candidate.

Another important step would be to establish an independent agency responsible for enforcing these regulations. This agency should have the power to investigate allegations of corruption and malfeasance, and to take action against candidates who fail to comply with campaign finance laws.

The benefits of stronger campaign finance regulations in the Philippines would be numerous. For one, they would help to increase transparency and accountability in politics. By requiring candidates to disclose their donors and expenditures, voters would have a better understanding of who is backing each candidate's campaign and what policies they are advocating for.

Additionally, stronger campaign finance regulations could help to reduce corruption and cronyism in politics. By limiting the amount of money that can be raised and spent by each candidate, politicians would be less tempted to accept donations from special interest groups or individuals with hidden agendas.

Finally, stronger campaign finance regulations could help to level the playing field for smaller candidates and independent organizations. Under current laws, larger campaigns often have a significant advantage when it comes to fundraising, which can make it difficult for smaller candidates to compete.

In conclusion, election campaign financial transparency is a critical issue in the Philippines. The lack of transparency in campaign financing creates an environment that fosters corruption and cronyism, making it difficult for voters to hold politicians accountable for their actions.

To address this problem, the Philippines needs to implement stronger campaign finance regulations, including requirements for disclosure and limits on fundraising. By taking these steps, the country can increase transparency and accountability in politics, reduce corruption and cronyism, and ensure that every vote counts.",1
73,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is a country plagued by numerous social and economic challenges, but one issue that continues to affect millions of Filipinos remains shrouded in secrecy and stigma - mental health. Despite being a major public health concern, mental illness is often stigmatized and misunderstood, leading to a lack of access to treatment and support for those who need it most.

The stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines can be attributed to various factors, including cultural and social norms, lack of education and awareness, and historical experiences of colonialism and foreign influence. In many Filipino households, mental illness is seen as a personal failing or a sign of weakness, rather than a legitimate medical condition that requires treatment and support.

This stigma is particularly damaging for individuals who are already vulnerable due to factors such as poverty, lack of education, and limited access to healthcare. Those struggling with mental health issues may be reluctant to seek help due to fear of being labeled as ""crazy"" or ""weak"", leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

The consequences of this stigma are far-reaching. Mental illness is a major contributor to disability and mortality worldwide, and the Philippines is no exception. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health disorders affect an estimated 12% of the Philippine population, with depression being the most common condition.

Furthermore, the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines can have a negative impact on the economy and society as a whole. A study by the Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) found that mental health issues can lead to reduced productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism (being physically present but not fully productive), resulting in significant economic losses.

To break down this stigma, it is essential to increase awareness and understanding of mental health among Filipinos. This can be achieved through various means, including education and training programs for healthcare professionals, community outreach and support services, and advocacy campaigns to raise awareness about mental health issues.

One notable example of a successful initiative to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines is the #BreakTheStigma campaign launched by the Philippine Psychiatric Association (PPA). The campaign aims to promote mental health awareness and education through social media, public events, and partnerships with schools, workplaces, and community organizations.

Another critical step towards reducing the stigma is to ensure that mental health services are accessible and affordable for all Filipinos. This can be achieved by increasing funding for mental health programs, expanding access to healthcare facilities, and promoting the use of telepsychiatry and other innovative technologies.

In addition, policymakers must take a proactive role in addressing the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines. The government has a responsibility to ensure that mental health services are included in the National Health Act, and that policies and programs are implemented to promote mental health awareness and education.

The journey towards greater awareness and understanding of mental health in the Philippines will not be easy. It requires a sustained effort from individuals, organizations, and governments to break down the stigma and promote a culture of inclusivity and support.

However, the benefits of this journey are well worth the effort. By reducing the stigma surrounding mental health, we can create a society where individuals feel comfortable seeking help when they need it most, and where mental illness is seen as a treatable medical condition rather than a personal failing.

In conclusion, breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, awareness, advocacy, and access to treatment. By working together, we can create a society where mental health is prioritized and supported, and where all Filipinos have access to the care and support they need to thrive.",1
74,Llama3.2,"As the Philippines continues to grow and develop, two of its most pressing challenges are urban congestion and housing shortages. The country's rapid urbanization has led to a surge in population growth, resulting in overcrowding and congestion in cities like Manila, Cebu, and Davao.

Urban congestion is a major issue in the Philippines, with commuters spending hours stuck in traffic every day. This not only affects productivity but also leads to increased air pollution, noise pollution, and stress levels. In fact, according to a study by the University of the Philippines, urban congestion costs the country's economy approximately P1.3 trillion (approximately USD 25 billion) annually.

The housing shortage is another pressing issue in the Philippines. With limited land supply and increasing demand for housing, prices have skyrocketed, making it difficult for low- and middle-income families to afford a decent place to live. According to data from the National Homeowners Association of the Philippines (NHA), there are over 2 million households living in informal settlements, with many more waiting lists for government-assisted housing programs.

The combination of urban congestion and housing shortages has far-reaching consequences for individuals, communities, and the economy as a whole. For instance, research by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) found that congested cities like Manila lead to increased health risks due to air pollution, heat stress, and reduced access to healthcare services.

Moreover, the lack of affordable housing options exacerbates social inequality in the Philippines. Families are forced to spend a significant portion of their income on rent or mortgage payments, leaving them with limited resources for other essential expenses like food, education, and healthcare. This perpetuates cycles of poverty and limits opportunities for economic mobility.

To address these pressing issues, policymakers must adopt a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes sustainable urban planning, affordable housing, and public transportation development. One effective strategy is to implement smart growth policies that encourage mixed-use development, denser settlements, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.

For example, the city of Makati's ""Smart Growth Plan"" promotes mixed-use development and efficient land use to reduce congestion and increase housing affordability. Similarly, the municipality of Taguig has implemented a ""Pedestrian-Friendly Infrastructure Plan"" that prioritizes walking and cycling infrastructure over car-centric designs.

Another critical step is to improve public transportation options in urban areas. The Philippines can learn from successful models like Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system or Hong Kong's Octopus card, which provide efficient, affordable, and reliable transportation services for commuters.

The government also plays a crucial role in addressing these issues. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHUD) should prioritize affordable housing programs that provide financing options for low- and middle-income families. Moreover, the Land Use Regulatory Board (LUB) should be empowered to enforce zoning regulations and ensure that new developments are designed with sustainability and community needs in mind.

The private sector also has a vital role to play in addressing urban congestion and housing shortages. Developers can prioritize affordable housing options, while transportation companies can invest in efficient public transportation systems. Businesses can also adopt flexible work arrangements that promote telecommuting or flexible schedules to reduce the need for lengthy commutes.

In conclusion, the Philippines' urban congestion and housing shortages are pressing issues that require a comprehensive response. By prioritizing sustainable urban planning, affordable housing, and public transportation development, we can create more livable cities where all Filipinos can thrive.",1
75,Llama3.2,"The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, has long been known for its rich marine biodiversity and pristine beaches. However, in recent years, the country's beauty and natural resources have come under threat from a growing menace: plastic pollution.

Every day, millions of tons of plastic waste are generated in the Philippines, with much of it ending up in our oceans, rivers, and landscapes. The effects of plastic pollution on the environment, human health, and the economy are far-reaching and devastating.

One of the most alarming statistics is that the Philippines generates over 2 million metric tons of plastic waste annually, with only about 20% being recycled or properly disposed of. The rest ends up in our oceans, where it harms marine life, contaminates the food chain, and poses a threat to human health.

The impacts of plastic pollution on the environment are numerous and severe. Plastic debris in our oceans has been found to be ingested by marine animals, including fish, birds, and mammals, which can lead to blockages, nutrient deficiencies, and even death. Sea turtles, in particular, are vulnerable to plastic pollution, with millions of them entangled or trapped in plastic waste every year.

The effects of plastic pollution on human health are equally concerning. Exposure to plastic debris has been linked to a range of health problems, including cancer, reproductive issues, and respiratory diseases. Additionally, the ingestion of microplastics by humans can lead to the consumption of toxic chemicals, which can have serious consequences for our health.

Furthermore, plastic pollution is also having a significant impact on the economy. The country's tourism industry is a major contributor to its GDP, but the presence of plastic waste in popular tourist destinations is driving visitors away and hurting local businesses.

To address this growing concern, the government must take immediate action to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable practices. One effective strategy is to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies, which hold manufacturers responsible for the waste generated by their products.

For example, the country can adopt a ban on single-use plastics, such as straws, bags, and water bottles, and replace them with biodegradable alternatives. This will not only reduce the amount of plastic waste but also promote innovation in sustainable packaging materials.

Another critical step is to increase public awareness and education about the impacts of plastic pollution. Governments, schools, and community organizations must work together to educate people about the importance of proper waste management and recycling.

Individuals can also make a difference by making conscious choices in their daily lives. Using reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups can significantly reduce our plastic usage. Additionally, supporting businesses that prioritize sustainability and use eco-friendly packaging materials is essential.

In conclusion, plastic pollution is a growing concern in the Philippines that requires immediate attention and action. The government, industries, and individuals must work together to reduce plastic waste, promote sustainable practices, and protect our environment for future generations.",1
76,Llama3.2,"Bridging the Gap: Addressing Income Inequality in the Philippines
The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, is home to a diverse and vibrant population of over 110 million people. Despite its rich natural resources, strategic location, and resilient workforce, the country continues to grapple with a persistent and pervasive issue: income inequality.

Income inequality, defined as the uneven distribution of income among individuals or households, has been a longstanding concern in the Philippines. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country's Gini coefficient, a widely used measure of income inequality, stood at 0.42 in 2020. This indicates that the Philippines has a relatively high level of income inequality, with the wealthiest 10% of the population holding nearly 30% of the country's total income.

The consequences of income inequality are far-reaching and devastating. It perpetuates poverty, limits social mobility, and undermines economic growth. In the Philippines, income inequality is particularly pronounced in rural areas, where access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities is often limited. This has led to a widening gap between the urban and rural poor, with the latter facing significant challenges in escaping the cycle of poverty.

One of the primary drivers of income inequality in the Philippines is the country's labor market. The Philippines has a large informal sector, with millions of workers engaged in precarious and low-paying jobs. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the informal sector accounts for over 30% of the country's total employment. This has led to a proliferation of low-quality jobs, which offer little in the way of job security, benefits, or opportunities for advancement.

Another significant contributor to income inequality in the Philippines is the country's tax system. The Philippines has a regressive tax system, which disproportionately burdens the poor and vulnerable. The value-added tax (VAT), for example, is a consumption tax that is levied on goods and services. While the VAT is intended to be neutral, it often ends up being regressive, as the poor tend to spend a larger proportion of their income on basic necessities.

To address income inequality in the Philippines, the government must adopt a comprehensive and multifaceted approach. This should include policies aimed at promoting job creation, improving access to education and healthcare, and enhancing the country's tax system.

One potential solution is to invest in education and training programs that equip workers with the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the modern economy. This could include vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and other forms of work-based learning. By investing in human capital, the government can help to increase productivity, improve job quality, and reduce income inequality.

Another key strategy is to improve access to healthcare and social services. The Philippines has made significant progress in expanding access to healthcare in recent years, but much work remains to be done. The government should prioritize investments in healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities. It should also work to expand access to social services, including cash transfer programs, food assistance, and other forms of support.

In terms of taxation, the government should consider reforms aimed at making the tax system more progressive. This could include introducing a more graduated income tax system, increasing taxes on luxury goods and services, and eliminating tax loopholes and exemptions that benefit the wealthy. By making the tax system more progressive, the government can help to reduce income inequality and promote greater fairness and equity.

Finally, the government should prioritize investments in rural development and infrastructure. Rural areas are often characterized by limited access to basic services, including education, healthcare, and job opportunities. By investing in rural infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and irrigation systems, the government can help to improve living standards, promote economic growth, and reduce poverty and inequality.

In conclusion, income inequality is a pressing concern in the Philippines, with far-reaching consequences for economic growth, social mobility, and human well-being. To address this issue, the government must adopt a comprehensive and multifaceted approach, including policies aimed at promoting job creation, improving access to education and healthcare, and enhancing the country's tax system. By working together, we can help to build a more equitable and prosperous society for all Filipinos.",1
77,Llama3.2,"The Unsung Heroes of the Philippine Economy: The Story of OFWs
The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, is home to a vibrant and resilient population of over 110 million people. Despite facing numerous challenges, including poverty, corruption, and natural disasters, the country has managed to maintain a relatively stable economy, thanks in large part to the contributions of its overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).

OFWs, also known as modern-day heroes, are Filipino citizens who work abroad, often in difficult and challenging conditions, to provide for their families and contribute to the country's economy. According to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), there are currently over 2.2 million OFWs working in over 200 countries around the world.

The impact of OFWs on the Philippine economy cannot be overstated. Remittances, or the money sent back home by OFWs, have become a vital source of foreign exchange earnings for the country. In 2020, OFW remittances reached a record high of $33.5 billion, accounting for approximately 10% of the country's GDP.

Remittances have a multiplier effect on the economy, stimulating consumption, investment, and economic growth. They also help to stabilize the country's balance of payments, reducing the country's reliance on foreign borrowing and mitigating the impact of external shocks.

Beyond their economic contributions, OFWs also play a critical role in promoting Philippine culture and values abroad. They serve as ambassadors of the country, showcasing the Filipino spirit of resilience, hard work, and hospitality.

Despite their significant contributions, however, OFWs often face numerous challenges and risks. Many work in difficult and hazardous conditions, with limited access to social protection and welfare services. They are also vulnerable to exploitation, abuse, and trafficking.

To address these concerns, the Philippine government has implemented various measures to protect and support OFWs. These include the establishment of the POEA, which regulates and monitors the recruitment and deployment of OFWs, as well as the provision of social services, such as counseling, training, and financial assistance.

In addition, the government has also launched initiatives to promote the welfare and well-being of OFWs, such as the ""OFW ID"" program, which provides OFWs with a special identification card that entitles them to discounts and privileges.

Despite these efforts, however, much work remains to be done to ensure the protection and welfare of OFWs. The government must continue to work with various stakeholders, including recruitment agencies, employers, and civil society organizations, to address the challenges and risks faced by OFWs.

In conclusion, OFWs are the unsung heroes of the Philippine economy. Their contributions have been instrumental in shaping the country's economic landscape, and their sacrifices have not gone unnoticed. As the country continues to navigate the complexities of globalization and economic development, it is essential that we prioritize the welfare and protection of our OFWs, recognizing their invaluable contributions to the nation.",1
78,Llama3.2,"Securing the Future of Food in the Philippines: A Call to Action
Food security, a fundamental human right, is a pressing concern in the Philippines. With a growing population, limited agricultural land, and increasing vulnerability to climate change, the country faces significant challenges in ensuring a stable and sustainable food supply. As the Philippines strives to achieve zero hunger and malnutrition, it is imperative that we address the pressing issues threatening our food security.

The Philippines is an agricultural country, with over 30% of its workforce employed in the sector. However, despite its rich natural resources and favorable climate, the country continues to struggle with food insecurity. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, approximately 17.3% of Filipino households experience moderate to severe food insecurity.

One of the primary drivers of food insecurity in the Philippines is the country's reliance on imported food. The Philippines is one of the largest importers of rice in the world, with over 10% of its total imports consisting of rice. This reliance on imported food not only drains the country's foreign exchange reserves but also undermines the livelihoods of local farmers.

Another significant challenge facing the Philippines is the impact of climate change on agriculture. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events are all taking a toll on the country's agricultural sector. The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with agriculture being one of the most affected sectors.

To address these challenges, the Philippine government must adopt a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to food security. This should include policies aimed at promoting agricultural development, improving food availability, and enhancing the resilience of the agricultural sector to climate change.

One potential solution is to invest in irrigation systems and other agricultural infrastructure. The Philippines has a significant irrigation backlog, with over 50% of its agricultural land lacking access to irrigation. By investing in irrigation systems, the government can help to increase crop yields, reduce post-harvest losses, and improve the overall productivity of the agricultural sector.

Another key strategy is to promote sustainable agriculture practices. This can include the use of climate-resilient crop and animal varieties, agroforestry, and conservation agriculture. By promoting sustainable agriculture practices, the government can help to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture, improve soil health, and increase the resilience of the agricultural sector to climate change.

In addition, the government should also prioritize investments in agricultural research and development. This can include the development of new crop and animal varieties, as well as the improvement of existing ones. By investing in agricultural research and development, the government can help to increase crop yields, improve food quality, and reduce the country's reliance on imported food.

Finally, the government should also work to improve access to markets and credit for smallholder farmers. Many smallholder farmers in the Philippines lack access to markets and credit, making it difficult for them to sell their products and invest in their farms. By improving access to markets and credit, the government can help to increase the incomes of smallholder farmers, improve their livelihoods, and reduce poverty and inequality.

In conclusion, food security is a pressing concern in the Philippines. To address this challenge, the government must adopt a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that promotes agricultural development, improves food availability, and enhances the resilience of the agricultural sector to climate change. By working together, we can help to ensure a food-secure future for all Filipinos.",1
79,Llama3.2,"Bridging the Digital Divide: Enhancing Accessibility of Technology in the Philippines
The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, has made significant strides in embracing technology as a tool for economic growth, social development, and improved governance. However, despite these advancements, the country still grapples with the challenge of ensuring accessibility of technology for all its citizens.

The digital divide, a term coined to describe the gap between those who have access to modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) and those who do not, remains a pressing concern in the Philippines. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), as of 2020, only 48.1% of households in the country have access to the internet. This translates to a significant portion of the population being left behind in the digital revolution.

One of the primary barriers to accessibility of technology in the Philippines is the lack of infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Many rural communities lack access to reliable and affordable internet connectivity, making it difficult for residents to access online services, information, and opportunities. The PSA reports that as of 2020, only 22.4% of municipalities in the country have access to fiber-optic internet connectivity.

Another significant challenge is the high cost of ICT services, including internet plans and mobile phone services. Many Filipinos, particularly those in low-income households, cannot afford the high costs of ICT services, making it difficult for them to access and utilize technology.

To address these challenges, the Philippine government has launched various initiatives aimed at enhancing accessibility of technology. One such initiative is the ""Free Wi-Fi for All"" program, which aims to provide free internet access to all citizens in public places. The government has also established the ""Department of Information and Communications Technology"" (DICT), which is responsible for developing and implementing policies and programs aimed at promoting ICT development and accessibility.

In addition, the private sector has also played a significant role in enhancing accessibility of technology in the Philippines. Many telecommunications companies have launched initiatives aimed at providing affordable ICT services to low-income households and rural communities.
However, despite these efforts, much work remains to be done to ensure that all Filipinos have access to technology. The government and private sector must continue to work together to address the challenges of infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy.

One potential solution is to invest in alternative technologies, such as satellite internet and mobile networks, to provide internet access to rural and remote communities. The government can also work with private sector partners to develop affordable ICT services and packages that cater to the needs of low-income households.

In addition, the government must also prioritize digital literacy programs aimed at educating citizens on how to effectively use technology to access information, services, and opportunities. This can include training programs for teachers, community leaders, and other stakeholders to promote digital literacy and online safety.

In conclusion, enhancing accessibility of technology is crucial for promoting economic growth, social development, and improved governance in the Philippines. While significant progress has been made, much work remains to be done to ensure that all Filipinos have access to technology. By working together, the government, private sector, and civil society can help bridge the digital divide and create a more inclusive and equitable digital landscape for all.",1
80,Llama3.2,"Empowering the Future: The Role of Philippine Youth in Shaping the Country's Politics
The Philippines, a country with a vibrant democracy and a young population, is at a critical juncture in its history. As the country navigates the complexities of governance, economic development, and social change, its youth play a crucial role in shaping its future. With over 30 million Filipinos aged 15-30, the youth demographic is a significant force that can no longer be ignored.

In recent years, Philippine youth have shown a growing interest in politics and governance. The 2016 elections, which saw the rise of President Rodrigo Duterte, were marked by high voter turnout among young Filipinos. According to the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), over 70% of registered voters aged 18-30 participated in the elections.

This increased engagement in politics is a welcome development, as it signals a growing awareness among young Filipinos of their role in shaping the country's future. However, it also poses challenges, as many young people are still learning about the complexities of governance and the democratic process.

To harness the energy and idealism of Philippine youth, it is essential to provide them with opportunities for civic engagement and leadership development. This can be achieved through various initiatives, such as voter education programs, leadership training, and community service projects.

One notable example of youth-led civic engagement is the ""Youth Vote Philippines"" movement, which aims to empower young Filipinos to participate in the electoral process. Through social media campaigns, voter education programs, and community outreach initiatives, the movement has helped to increase voter turnout among young Filipinos and promote a culture of civic engagement.

Another example is the ""Sangguniang Kabataan"" (SK) or Youth Council, a government-mandated program that aims to promote youth participation in governance. Through the SK, young Filipinos are given the opportunity to participate in local governance, develop leadership skills, and contribute to community development projects.

Despite these initiatives, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed. One major concern is the lack of representation of young Filipinos in government. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), as of 2020, only 2.5% of elected officials in the country are aged 18-30.

To address this gap, it is essential to promote youth representation in government through various means, such as youth quotas, leadership training, and mentorship programs. By providing young Filipinos with opportunities for leadership development and civic engagement, we can help to ensure that their voices are heard and their concerns are addressed.

In conclusion, the role of Philippine youth in shaping the country's politics is critical. As the country navigates the complexities of governance and development, it is essential to empower young Filipinos with the skills, knowledge, and opportunities needed to participate in the democratic process. By promoting youth representation, civic engagement, and leadership development, we can help to ensure a brighter future for the Philippines.",1

82,Gemini1.5-flash,"The health of a democracy hinges on the integrity of its electoral processes. In the Philippines, the interplay between campaign finance, transparency, and the overall democratic experience is a complex and often contentious issue. While laws exist to regulate campaign spending and ensure transparency, significant challenges remain, hindering the realization of a truly level playing field and undermining public trust in government.

The Ideal: Fair Elections and Informed Voters

In a truly democratic system, elections should be contests of ideas, not of wealth. Campaign finance regulations aim to level the playing field, ensuring that candidates with merit and popular support, not just deep pockets, have a fair chance to compete. Transparency in campaign finance is crucial for several reasons:

Informed Voter Choice: When voters have access to information about the sources of campaign funding, they can make more informed decisions. They can assess whether candidates are beholden to special interests or truly represent the will of the people.
Reduced Corruption: Transparent campaign finance helps to deter corruption by making it more difficult for candidates to engage in illicit activities such as money laundering, bribery, and the use of undisclosed funds.
Increased Public Trust: When citizens can see how political campaigns are funded and how politicians are spending public money, they are more likely to trust that their government is acting in their best interests.
Promoting Accountability: Transparency in campaign finance allows for greater public scrutiny of political activities. Citizens and civil society organizations can monitor campaign spending, identify potential conflicts of interest, and hold politicians accountable for their actions.
The Reality: Challenges and Loopholes

Despite the existence of laws regulating campaign finance, significant challenges remain in achieving true transparency and accountability in Philippine elections:

Weak Enforcement: Weak enforcement of existing laws allows for widespread circumvention of regulations. Loopholes in the law are exploited, and penalties for violations are often inadequate or rarely enforced.

Limited Resources: Understaffed and underfunded election authorities struggle to effectively monitor campaign spending and investigate potential violations.
Opaque Sources of Funding: Many sources of campaign funding remain opaque, making it difficult to track the true origins of campaign funds.
Rise of ""Dark Money"": The rise of ""dark money"" – contributions from undisclosed sources – poses a significant challenge to campaign finance transparency.
The Impact on Democracy:

The lack of transparency in campaign finance has serious implications for Philippine democracy:

Erosion of Public Trust: The perception of corruption and undue influence in politics erodes public trust in government institutions and undermines the legitimacy of the electoral process.
Unequal Playing Field: Wealthy candidates and those with access to significant financial resources enjoy an unfair advantage, hindering the participation of ordinary citizens in the political process.
Distorted Policy-Making: The influence of large donors can distort the political process, leading to policies that favor the interests of wealthy elites rather than the needs of the general public.
Increased Vulnerability to Corruption: Lack of transparency creates opportunities for corruption, such as bribery, extortion, and the misuse of public funds.
Towards a More Transparent and Accountable System:

To strengthen the integrity of the electoral process and enhance public trust, several key steps are crucial:

Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms: Enhancing the capacity of election authorities to investigate and prosecute violations of campaign finance laws.
Closing Loopholes in the Law: Revising and strengthening campaign finance laws to close loopholes and address emerging challenges, such as the rise of ""dark money.""
Improving Data Accessibility: Making campaign finance data more accessible to the public through online platforms and user-friendly formats.
Promoting Public Awareness: Conducting public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities in relation to campaign finance.
Encouraging Civil Society Engagement: Encouraging the active participation of civil society organizations in monitoring campaign finance and advocating for electoral reforms.
Conclusion:

Transparency in campaign finance is not merely a technical issue; it is a fundamental pillar of a healthy democracy. By strengthening existing laws, improving enforcement mechanisms, and promoting public awareness, the Philippines can move towards a more level playing field in its electoral processes, where candidates are elected based on their merit and their vision for the country, not on the size of their bank accounts. This is a critical step towards restoring public trust in government and ensuring that democracy truly serves the interests of all Filipinos.",1

85,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, an archipelago of breathtaking beauty, is increasingly drowning in plastic. From pristine beaches to bustling cities, the ubiquitous presence of plastic waste has become a national crisis, threatening marine ecosystems, human health, and the very fabric of society.

A Plastic Tide:

The Philippines is a major contributor to global plastic pollution, with millions of tons of plastic waste entering the oceans each year. This alarming statistic stems from a confluence of factors:   

The ""Sachet Economy"": The widespread use of single-use sachets for everyday products, from shampoo to coffee, has created a mountain of plastic waste. These small, seemingly insignificant packages are difficult to recycle and often end up in waterways and oceans.   
Inadequate Waste Management: A significant portion of the country lacks proper waste management infrastructure, with open dumps and uncontrolled landfills common. This leads to plastic waste leaching into the environment, contaminating soil and water.   
Weak Enforcement of Regulations: Existing environmental regulations are often poorly enforced, allowing industries to continue producing excessive amounts of plastic and contributing to the plastic waste crisis.

86,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Unending Divide: Confronting Income Inequality in the Philippines
The Philippines, a nation brimming with natural beauty and a vibrant culture, grapples with a persistent and deeply troubling societal ill: stark income inequality. While the economy has shown periods of growth, the benefits haven't trickled down equitably, leaving a significant portion of the population trapped in a cycle of poverty, while a privileged few amass considerable wealth. This chasm isn't just a moral failing; it's a fundamental threat to the nation's stability and long-term prosperity. Addressing this inequality requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond superficial solutions and tackles the systemic issues at its core.

The sheer scale of the problem is staggering. Various studies, including those by the World Bank and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), consistently rank the Philippines among the most unequal countries in Southeast Asia and globally. The Gini coefficient, a common measure of income inequality, consistently places the Philippines in a concerningly high range, indicating a vast disparity between the richest and the poorest. This disparity isn't just about comparing the wealthiest 1% to the poorest 10%; it's about the significant gap between the upper and middle classes, and the substantial portion of the population struggling to meet basic needs. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few hinders economic growth, as it limits consumer spending and investment in crucial sectors.

Several factors contribute to this pervasive inequality. One significant contributor is the deeply rooted land ownership patterns. A small elite controls a disproportionate share of arable land, leaving a large segment of the agricultural workforce landless and vulnerable to exploitation. This creates a system where wealth is inherited and perpetuated across generations, while the vast majority remain trapped in cycles of poverty, often working in subsistence agriculture with minimal opportunities for advancement.

Furthermore, access to quality education and healthcare remains unevenly distributed. While progress has been made, significant disparities exist between urban and rural areas, and between the wealthy and the poor. Lack of access to quality education limits upward mobility, perpetuating a cycle of poverty across generations. Similarly, inadequate healthcare access exacerbates existing inequalities, pushing vulnerable families further into debt and despair when faced with illness or emergency situations.

The existing tax system also contributes to the problem. While reforms have been implemented, loopholes and weaknesses persist, allowing high-income earners and large corporations to minimize their tax burden, while the poor bear a disproportionate share of indirect taxes. This regressive tax system further widens the gap between the rich and the poor, hindering efforts to redistribute wealth and invest in crucial social programs.

Corruption plays a significant, insidious role. Mismanagement of public funds, embezzlement, and cronyism divert resources away from vital social programs and infrastructure development, exacerbating inequalities and eroding public trust. This erosion of trust further hinders effective governance and the implementation of policies aimed at reducing income disparity.

Addressing this multifaceted challenge requires a comprehensive and sustained effort. Land reform, while a contentious issue, remains crucial to empowering the rural poor and fostering a more equitable distribution of resources. Investing heavily in quality education and healthcare, particularly in underserved areas, is paramount to ensuring equal opportunities for all citizens. This requires not just increased funding, but also a focus on improving the quality of teaching, curriculum design, and healthcare infrastructure.

Tax reforms are also essential. A progressive tax system that places a higher burden on high-income earners and corporations while providing tax relief for low-income individuals is crucial. Strengthening tax enforcement and closing loopholes will ensure a more equitable distribution of resources. Combating corruption through enhanced transparency and accountability mechanisms is equally crucial for ensuring that public funds are used effectively and efficiently.

Finally, fostering inclusive economic growth is essential. Creating a business environment that promotes small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and provides opportunities for entrepreneurship, particularly in rural areas, can help to create more jobs and reduce poverty. Targeted social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, can provide crucial support to vulnerable families and help break the cycle of poverty.

Tackling income inequality in the Philippines is not a quick fix; it's a long-term commitment requiring sustained political will, robust policy reforms, and a collaborative effort from all stakeholders. Ignoring this challenge will have devastating consequences, undermining social cohesion, fueling social unrest, and hindering the nation's potential for sustainable and inclusive development. The time for decisive action is now, before the widening divide irrevocably damages the fabric of Philippine society.",1
87,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Overseas Filipino Worker: Backbone of the Nation, Burden of a System?
The Philippines stands as a unique nation, inextricably linked to the global economy through its vast diaspora of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). These modern-day heroes, often leaving behind families and loved ones, contribute billions of dollars annually to the national economy, acting as a crucial lifeline for millions. However, the reliance on OFW remittances reveals a complex and troubling picture, one that highlights both the resilience of the Filipino spirit and the systemic weaknesses within the Philippine economy.

The sheer scale of OFW remittances is staggering. Year after year, these funds represent a significant portion of the country's GDP, acting as a crucial buffer against economic downturns and a vital source of foreign exchange. This influx of money directly supports millions of families, funding education, healthcare, housing, and daily necessities. Many families rely entirely on these remittances for survival, creating a profound dependence that underscores the precariousness of this economic model.

The positive impact of OFWs on the Philippine economy is undeniable. Remittances stimulate consumption, fueling demand for goods and services across various sectors. They contribute significantly to poverty reduction, though this impact is unevenly distributed, often benefiting specific regions and communities more than others. Moreover, OFWs gain valuable skills and experience abroad, often returning home with enhanced expertise that could potentially contribute to the development of local industries.

However, the dependence on OFW remittances masks a deeper, more problematic reality. This reliance reveals a fundamental weakness within the domestic economy’s inability to generate sufficient high-paying jobs for its own citizens. The ""brain drain"" effect, where skilled and educated Filipinos seek opportunities abroad, represents a significant loss of human capital for the nation. This loss of potential contributes to a less diversified and less robust economy, leaving it vulnerable to external shocks, such as global recessions or changes in global labor markets.

The vulnerability of OFWs themselves is another critical concern. Many face exploitative labor practices, low wages, and precarious working conditions abroad. They often lack adequate legal protection and support, leaving them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. The emotional toll on families separated by long distances is equally significant, creating social and psychological challenges that are often overlooked in discussions about the economic impact of OFWs.

The government's role in protecting and supporting OFWs is crucial yet often falls short. While various programs and agencies exist to assist OFWs, their effectiveness is frequently debated. Bureaucratic hurdles, lack of resources, and inadequate coordination between different government bodies often hinder their ability to provide timely and effective support. Furthermore, the government's focus often seems to be on maximizing remittances rather than addressing the underlying structural issues that drive Filipinos to seek employment abroad.

Addressing the challenges posed by the heavy reliance on OFW remittances requires a multi-pronged approach. Investing in education and skills development is crucial, equipping Filipinos with the skills needed to compete in a globalized economy and creating opportunities for high-paying jobs within the country. This includes focusing on STEM education, vocational training, and entrepreneurship programs. Improving the business environment and fostering a more competitive economy will attract foreign investment and create more jobs for Filipinos.

The government also needs to strengthen its protection and support mechanisms for OFWs, ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and access to legal assistance. This includes strengthening diplomatic efforts to secure the rights of Filipino workers abroad and providing comprehensive pre-departure and post-arrival support services. Furthermore, policies should focus on promoting sustainable economic growth that generates sufficient and equitable employment opportunities within the country, thereby reducing the dependence on overseas employment.

In conclusion, the contributions of OFWs to the Philippine economy are undeniable. Their sacrifices and hard work form the backbone of many families and contribute significantly to national development. However, this reliance highlights the urgent need for systemic change. The Philippines needs to move beyond a model that relies heavily on the labor of its citizens abroad and focus on building a robust, diversified, and inclusive economy that provides sustainable and fulfilling employment opportunities for all Filipinos, allowing them to build their lives and futures at home. Only then can the nation truly harness the full potential of its citizens and realize its aspirations for sustainable development and prosperity.",1
88,Gemini1.5-flash,"A Nation's Plate: Confronting the Challenges of Food Security in the Philippines
The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, boasts a rich agricultural heritage. Yet, despite this natural bounty, the nation grapples with a persistent and complex challenge: food security. While the country produces a significant portion of its food needs, significant vulnerabilities exist, leaving millions vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition, and highlighting the need for a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to ensure a stable and sustainable food future.

The current state of Philippine food security is a precarious balancing act. While the country is largely self-sufficient in rice, its staple crop, production remains susceptible to the vagaries of climate change, typhoons, and fluctuating global rice prices. Other crucial food items, including meat, dairy, and certain fruits and vegetables, are heavily reliant on imports, creating vulnerabilities to external shocks and price volatility. This dependence exposes the nation's food system to global market fluctuations, making it particularly susceptible to disruptions in international trade and supply chains.

Several factors contribute to this precarious situation. Climate change is a major threat, with increasingly frequent and intense typhoons and unpredictable weather patterns devastating agricultural lands and disrupting planting cycles. Rising sea levels threaten coastal farms and fisheries, further diminishing agricultural productivity. The lack of access to modern farming techniques, irrigation systems, and high-yielding seeds limits the productivity of many farmers, particularly those in rural areas.

Land tenure insecurity is another significant impediment. Many farmers lack secure land ownership, hindering their ability to invest in long-term improvements and making them vulnerable to eviction or exploitation. This instability discourages investment in sustainable farming practices and limits access to credit and other financial services, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and hindering agricultural development.

Post-harvest losses represent a significant challenge. Inadequate infrastructure, including storage facilities and transportation networks, lead to substantial losses of produce before it reaches the market. This waste exacerbates food shortages and increases food prices, disproportionately affecting low-income consumers. The lack of access to efficient processing and preservation technologies further contributes to these losses.

The existing agricultural support system also needs significant improvement. While the government provides various subsidies and programs, their effectiveness is often hampered by corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and lack of adequate targeting. Many farmers lack access to vital information and resources, hindering their ability to adopt improved farming practices and improve their livelihoods.

Addressing the challenges of food security requires a multi-pronged approach. Investing in climate-resilient agriculture is paramount. This includes promoting drought-resistant crops, developing improved irrigation systems, and implementing strategies to adapt to the changing climate. Supporting smallholder farmers through access to credit, training, and improved technology is crucial to enhancing their productivity and resilience. Land reform initiatives can provide farmers with secure land tenure, empowering them to invest in sustainable farming practices.

Improving post-harvest infrastructure, including storage facilities, transportation networks, and processing plants, is crucial to minimize food losses and improve market access for farmers. Developing robust food safety regulations and strengthening quality control mechanisms will ensure that consumers have access to safe and nutritious food.

Strengthening the agricultural support system is equally important. This involves improving the targeting and effectiveness of government subsidies, enhancing the delivery of crucial services, and promoting transparency and accountability in agricultural governance. Investing in research and development to develop improved crop varieties and farming techniques is essential for enhancing agricultural productivity and resilience.

Finally, promoting diversification in food production is essential to reduce dependence on imports and enhance food security. This includes encouraging the cultivation of a wider range of crops and livestock, promoting sustainable aquaculture, and supporting local food systems.

Food security is not merely an agricultural issue; it's a matter of national security, social equity, and economic stability. Addressing this challenge requires a holistic approach, involving government agencies, private sector players, civil society organizations, and farmers themselves. Only through collaborative efforts and sustained investment can the Philippines achieve a food-secure future, ensuring that all its citizens have access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. The time for decisive action is now, before the vulnerabilities in the nation's food system lead to more widespread hunger and instability.",1
89,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Digital Divide: Bridging the Gap to Technological Accessibility in the Philippines
The Philippines, a nation increasingly reliant on technology for economic growth and social progress, faces a stark reality: a significant digital divide. While technological advancements have revolutionized many aspects of life, access to these innovations remains unevenly distributed, creating a chasm between those who benefit from the digital revolution and those left behind. This disparity is not merely a technological challenge; it’s a social and economic one, hindering the country's potential for inclusive growth and equitable development.

The digital divide manifests in various forms. Geographic location plays a crucial role; access to reliable internet connectivity remains a significant challenge in many rural and remote areas. Infrastructure limitations, coupled with the high cost of internet access, effectively exclude large segments of the population from participating in the digital economy. The lack of widespread broadband infrastructure, particularly in underserved communities, restricts access to online education, healthcare, government services, and job opportunities. This digital isolation perpetuates existing inequalities and limits opportunities for social and economic mobility.

Socioeconomic status is another critical factor contributing to the digital divide. The cost of devices, such as computers and smartphones, remains prohibitive for many low-income families. Even with affordable devices, the ongoing cost of internet access can create a significant financial burden, forcing families to prioritize other essential needs over digital connectivity. This economic disparity leads to a situation where those with greater financial resources enjoy the benefits of technology, while those with limited resources are left behind, further exacerbating existing inequalities.

Digital literacy, or the ability to effectively use technology, is also a significant barrier. While technology adoption rates are increasing, a significant portion of the population lacks the necessary skills to effectively utilize digital tools and platforms. This lack of digital literacy limits access to online resources and opportunities, perpetuating the cycle of exclusion. Furthermore, the digital content available may not be accessible to all, with language barriers and lack of accessibility features for individuals with disabilities creating further challenges.

The consequences of this digital divide are far-reaching. In education, it limits access to online learning resources and creates a disparity in educational outcomes between students in urban and rural areas. In healthcare, it restricts access to telemedicine and online health information, exacerbating health disparities and limiting access to quality care, particularly in remote communities. In the economy, it hinders participation in the digital economy, limiting opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship, particularly for individuals in marginalized communities.

Addressing the digital divide requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach. Expanding broadband infrastructure to reach underserved areas is crucial. This requires significant investment in infrastructure development, along with policies that incentivize private sector participation in expanding connectivity to remote regions. Making internet access more affordable is also critical, potentially through government subsidies or initiatives to promote competition among internet service providers.

Promoting digital literacy is equally important. Government and private sector initiatives should focus on providing digital skills training and education to all segments of the population, particularly those in underserved communities. This includes creating accessible and culturally relevant training programs that cater to diverse learning styles and needs.

Addressing affordability concerns requires targeted interventions. Government subsidies or initiatives to provide low-cost devices and internet access to low-income families can help bridge the digital divide. Creating programs that provide access to technology in community centers and libraries can also help expand digital access in underserved areas.

Furthermore, promoting inclusive digital content is crucial. Ensuring that online content is accessible in various languages and formats, including accessible formats for individuals with disabilities, is essential for ensuring equitable access to information and opportunities.

The digital divide is not an insurmountable challenge, but it requires a sustained commitment from the government, the private sector, and civil society organizations. Bridging this gap is not just about providing access to technology; it's about creating a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to benefit from the transformative power of the digital revolution. Failure to address this challenge will continue to perpetuate existing inequalities and limit the Philippines' potential for sustainable development and social progress.",1
90,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Rising Tide: Philippine Youth and the Shifting Sands of Politics
The Philippines is a nation defined by its vibrant and dynamic youth population. Comprising a significant portion of the electorate, this generation possesses the potential to reshape the country's political landscape, influencing policy, demanding accountability, and ultimately shaping the future trajectory of the nation. However, realizing this potential requires addressing the challenges faced by young Filipinos engaging in the political process and fostering an environment conducive to their meaningful participation.

The energy and idealism of Filipino youth are undeniable. Recent electoral cycles have witnessed a surge in youth voter turnout, driven by a desire for change and a rejection of traditional political norms. This increased engagement reflects a growing awareness of pressing social and economic issues, including poverty, inequality, corruption, and climate change. Young Filipinos are increasingly utilizing social media and digital platforms to organize, mobilize, and advocate for their concerns, bypassing traditional media channels and directly engaging with policymakers and the public.

This surge in youth activism is not without its complexities. While young people demonstrate an increased willingness to engage in political discourse and activism, significant barriers hinder their full participation in the political process. Limited access to information and political education leaves many young Filipinos uninformed about the complexities of policy and governance. This lack of knowledge can lead to disillusionment and a sense of powerlessness, hindering their engagement in the political system.

Financial constraints pose another significant challenge. The cost of campaigning, including registration fees, transportation, and materials, can be prohibitive for young candidates and grassroots organizations. This financial barrier disproportionately impacts young people from low-income backgrounds, limiting their opportunities to run for office or effectively advocate for their interests.

Furthermore, the deeply entrenched political culture of the Philippines presents a significant hurdle. Patronage politics, dynastic rule, and the prevalence of corruption create a challenging environment for young, idealistic candidates seeking to challenge the status quo. Navigating this complex and often opaque political landscape requires resilience, resources, and often, a willingness to compromise one's ideals.

However, the challenges faced by Filipino youth in shaping Philippine politics are not insurmountable. Increased investment in civic education and political literacy programs is crucial. These programs should equip young people with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively participate in the political process, encouraging informed decision-making and responsible citizenship. Providing financial support and resources for young candidates and grassroots organizations can help level the playing field, empowering them to compete effectively in the electoral process.

Strengthening electoral reforms is also crucial. Implementing measures to limit campaign spending and address the issue of political dynasties can create a more equitable and transparent political environment, making it easier for young candidates to compete effectively and encouraging greater participation from marginalized communities.

Promoting transparency and accountability in government is vital. Making government data and information readily available to the public can foster greater civic engagement and empower citizens to hold their elected officials accountable. Encouraging the use of technology and digital platforms to enhance communication and engagement between government and citizens can facilitate greater participation and transparency.

The role of social media and digital platforms cannot be overstated. While these tools have been instrumental in mobilizing youth activism, it is crucial to ensure that this engagement is informed and responsible. Combating the spread of misinformation and promoting media literacy are crucial to ensuring that young people have access to reliable information and can engage in constructive political discourse.

Ultimately, the future of Philippine politics rests, in part, on the shoulders of its youth. Empowering this generation to participate fully and meaningfully in the political process requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders—the government, civil society organizations, educational institutions, and the media. By addressing the challenges faced by young Filipinos engaging in politics and creating a more inclusive and transparent political environment, the Philippines can unlock the transformative potential of its youth and pave the way for a more just, equitable, and prosperous future.",1
91,Copilot,"The concept of federalism has been a recurring theme in the political discourse of the Philippines for over a century. Advocates argue that a federal system could address the country's longstanding issues of regional inequality, inefficiency in governance, and the concentration of power in ""imperial Manila."" This editorial explores the history, arguments for and against federalism, and its potential impact on the Philippines.

Historical Context
The idea of federalism in the Philippines dates back to the late 19th century. Filipino revolutionary leaders like Emilio Aguinaldo and Apolinario Mabini envisioned a federal structure that would divide the country into three states: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao1. This vision was rooted in the desire to create a more balanced and representative government that could address the diverse needs of the archipelago.

In the modern era, federalism gained renewed attention during the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, who campaigned on a platform that included the promise of shifting to a federal system2. Duterte's push for federalism was driven by the belief that decentralization could promote regional development and address the grievances of marginalized areas, particularly in Mindanao2.

Arguments for Federalism
Proponents of federalism in the Philippines present several compelling arguments:

Decentralization of Power: Federalism would distribute power more evenly across the country, reducing the dominance of Metro Manila. This decentralization could lead to more responsive and accountable local governments1.

Economic Development: By granting regions greater control over their resources and policies, federalism could spur economic development in underdeveloped areas. Local governments would have the autonomy to tailor economic strategies to their specific needs3.

Addressing Regional Inequality: Federalism could help bridge the gap between wealthy and poor regions. By empowering local governments, it could ensure a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities3.

Cultural and Ethnic Representation: The Philippines is home to diverse cultural and ethnic groups. A federal system could provide better representation and autonomy for these groups, fostering a sense of inclusion and reducing regional tensions2.

Improved Governance: Decentralized governance could lead to more efficient and effective public services. Local governments, being closer to the people, could respond more swiftly to their needs and concerns3.

Arguments Against Federalism
Despite its potential benefits, federalism also faces significant opposition and challenges:

Risk of Fragmentation: Critics argue that federalism could lead to the fragmentation of the country. The creation of autonomous regions might encourage separatist movements and weaken national unity4.

Economic Disparities: There is a concern that federalism could exacerbate economic disparities between regions. Wealthier regions might thrive, while poorer ones could struggle without sufficient support from the central government4.

Implementation Challenges: Transitioning to a federal system would require significant constitutional changes and a comprehensive overhaul of existing institutions. This process could be complex, costly, and time-consuming4.

Political Dynasties: Federalism might entrench political dynasties at the regional level. Local elites could consolidate power, leading to corruption and patronage politics4.

Lack of Preparedness: Some argue that the Philippines is not yet ready for federalism. The country needs to strengthen its institutions and governance mechanisms before undertaking such a radical shift4.

Potential Impact on Governance and Society
If implemented effectively, federalism could have a transformative impact on the Philippines:

Enhanced Local Governance: Federalism could empower local governments to address their unique challenges and opportunities. This could lead to more innovative and context-specific solutions to local issues3.

Economic Growth: By promoting regional development, federalism could stimulate economic growth across the country. Regions would have the autonomy to attract investments, develop infrastructure, and create jobs3.

Social Cohesion: Federalism could foster a sense of belonging and representation among diverse cultural and ethnic groups. This inclusivity could strengthen social cohesion and reduce regional conflicts2.

Political Accountability: Decentralized governance could enhance political accountability. Local leaders would be more directly accountable to their constituents, leading to better governance and reduced corruption3.

National Unity: While there are concerns about fragmentation, a well-designed federal system could actually strengthen national unity by addressing regional grievances and promoting a more balanced distribution of power2.

Conclusion
The debate over federalism in the Philippines is complex and multifaceted. While it offers the promise of decentralization, regional development, and improved governance, it also poses significant risks and challenges. The success of federalism would depend on careful planning, robust institutions, and a commitment to equitable development.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt federalism should be guided by a thorough and inclusive dialogue that considers the diverse perspectives and needs of all Filipinos. By addressing the root causes of regional inequality and fostering a more inclusive political system, the Philippines can move towards a more prosperous and united future.",1
92,Copilot,"Election campaign finance transparency is a cornerstone of democratic integrity. In the Philippines, where elections are a vibrant and essential part of the political landscape, ensuring transparency in campaign finance is crucial to maintaining public trust and preventing corruption. This editorial explores the current state of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, the challenges faced, and potential solutions to enhance accountability.

The Legal Framework
The Philippines has established a legal framework to promote transparency in election campaign finance. Key laws and regulations include:

Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881): This code requires every candidate and political party treasurer to submit a full, true, and itemized statement of all contributions and expenditures related to the election1.

Republic Act No. 7166: This act provides for synchronized national and local elections and elaborates on the deadlines, required contents, and significance of submitting the Statement of Contributions and Expenses (SOCE). It also prescribes penalties for non-compliance1.

COMELEC Resolutions: The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) issues resolutions before each election cycle to set specific guidelines for the submission of the SOCE, detailing requirements such as formats, additional information, and deadlines1.

These regulations aim to ensure that all financial activities related to election campaigns are disclosed, promoting transparency and accountability.

The Role of the SOCE
The SOCE is a critical component of Philippine election law. It requires candidates, political parties, and contributors to disclose their financial activities related to the election campaign. The SOCE must include:

Contributions: A detailed listing of all contributions received, including cash contributions, in-kind donations (e.g., services, goods, property), and any other forms of support. The source of each contribution must be clearly stated, specifying the name of the donor, their address, and the amount/value of the contribution1.
Expenditures: All campaign-related expenditures must be itemized, including expenses for advertisements, rallies, staff, equipment, and transportation. The expenditures must comply with the limitations and prohibitions set forth under election law1.
Disclosure of Unspent Contributions: Any unused contributions must also be declared. Under the law, such amounts should be returned to the donors or turned over to the national treasury if donors are not identifiable1.
Challenges to Transparency
Despite the legal framework, several challenges hinder the effective implementation of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines:

Weak Enforcement: The enforcement of campaign finance laws is often weak. COMELEC, the body responsible for overseeing elections, faces resource constraints and lacks the capacity to thoroughly audit all SOCE submissions2.

Political Dynasties and Influence: The prevalence of political dynasties and the influence of wealthy individuals and corporations can undermine transparency efforts. These entities often have the resources to circumvent regulations and exert undue influence on the electoral process2.

Misinformation and Lack of Awareness: Many candidates and contributors are either unaware of the requirements or deliberately choose to ignore them. This lack of awareness and the spread of misinformation can lead to non-compliance2.

Inconsistent Reporting: The quality and consistency of SOCE submissions vary widely. Some candidates provide detailed and accurate reports, while others submit incomplete or misleading information2.

Potential Solutions
To enhance campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, several measures can be taken:

Strengthening Enforcement: COMELEC should be provided with adequate resources and authority to enforce campaign finance laws effectively. This includes increasing its capacity to audit SOCE submissions and imposing stricter penalties for non-compliance2.

Promoting Public Awareness: Educating candidates, political parties, and the public about the importance of campaign finance transparency is crucial. Public awareness campaigns can help ensure that all stakeholders understand their responsibilities and the consequences of non-compliance2.

Leveraging Technology: Implementing digital platforms for the submission and auditing of SOCEs can improve efficiency and accuracy. Online systems can facilitate real-time monitoring and make it easier for COMELEC to identify discrepancies2.

Encouraging Civil Society Participation: Civil society organizations can play a vital role in promoting transparency. By monitoring campaign finance activities and advocating for reforms, these organizations can help hold candidates and political parties accountable2.

Enhancing Legal Provisions: Revising and updating campaign finance laws to address current challenges and loopholes is essential. This includes setting clearer guidelines for contributions and expenditures and ensuring that all financial activities are transparently reported2.

Conclusion
Transparency in election campaign finance is fundamental to the integrity of the democratic process in the Philippines. While the country has established a robust legal framework, challenges remain in ensuring effective implementation and compliance. By strengthening enforcement, promoting public awareness, leveraging technology, encouraging civil society participation, and enhancing legal provisions, the Philippines can move towards a more transparent and accountable electoral system. Ensuring that all financial activities related to election campaigns are disclosed and scrutinized is not only a legal requirement but also a moral imperative to uphold the principles of democracy and good governance.",1
93,Copilot,"Mental health stigma remains a significant barrier to well-being in the Philippines. Despite recent progress, many Filipinos still face prejudice and misunderstanding when it comes to mental health issues. This editorial explores the roots of mental health stigma in the Philippines, its impact on individuals and society, and the steps needed to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment.

The Roots of Mental Health Stigma
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is deeply rooted in cultural, religious, and historical contexts. Several factors contribute to this pervasive issue:

Cultural Values: Filipino culture places a high value on resilience and endurance. The concept of ""hiya"" (shame) and ""pakikisama"" (the need to conform and maintain social harmony) often discourages individuals from openly discussing their mental health struggles1. Admitting to mental health issues is sometimes seen as a sign of weakness or a personal failing.

Religious Beliefs: In a predominantly Catholic country, mental health issues are sometimes attributed to a lack of faith or divine punishment1. This belief can lead individuals to seek spiritual rather than medical solutions, delaying or avoiding professional help.

Lack of Public Health Education: There is a widespread lack of understanding about mental health conditions. Terms like ""baliw"" (crazy) are often used indiscriminately to describe a range of mental health issues, reflecting a lack of nuanced understanding2. This ignorance perpetuates stereotypes and misconceptions.

The Impact of Stigma
The stigma surrounding mental health has far-reaching consequences for individuals and society:

Delayed Treatment: Many Filipinos delay seeking help due to fear of judgment and discrimination1. This can lead to the worsening of mental health conditions and increased risk of suicide. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 3.3 million Filipinos live with depression, yet many do not receive the care they need1.

Discrimination: Stigma leads to discrimination in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and social interactions1. Individuals with mental health conditions may face exclusion and prejudice, further exacerbating their struggles.

Economic Burden: Untreated mental health issues can result in decreased productivity and increased healthcare costs1. The economic impact of mental health stigma is significant, affecting not only individuals but also the broader economy.

Social Isolation: Stigma can lead to social isolation, as individuals may withdraw from their communities to avoid judgment1. This isolation can worsen mental health conditions and hinder recovery.

Steps Towards Change
Addressing mental health stigma in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach:

Education and Awareness: Increasing public awareness about mental health is crucial. Educational campaigns can help dispel myths and misconceptions, promoting a more accurate understanding of mental health conditions1. Schools, workplaces, and community organizations should be involved in these efforts.

Legislation and Policy: The passage of the Mental Health Act of 2018 was a significant milestone2. This law aims to provide accessible and affordable mental health services, integrate mental health education into schools, and raise public awareness. Continued support for such legislation is essential to ensure its effective implementation.

Accessible Mental Health Services: Expanding access to mental health services is vital. This includes increasing the number of mental health professionals, improving facilities, and ensuring that services are available in both urban and rural areas1. Telehealth services can also play a role in reaching underserved populations.

Community Support: Building supportive communities is key to reducing stigma. Community-based programs that provide safe spaces for individuals to discuss their mental health can foster understanding and acceptance1. Peer support groups and mental health advocates can also play a crucial role.

Media Representation: The media has a powerful influence on public perceptions. Promoting accurate and compassionate portrayals of mental health in the media can help challenge stereotypes and reduce stigma1. Influential personalities sharing their mental health journeys can also normalize conversations around this topic.

Encouraging Open Dialogue: Creating an environment where people feel comfortable discussing their mental health is essential. Encouraging open dialogue within families, schools, and workplaces can help break down barriers and promote a culture of acceptance1.

Conclusion
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is a complex issue that requires concerted efforts from all sectors of society. By addressing the cultural, religious, and educational roots of stigma, and by promoting awareness, legislation, and community support, the Philippines can move towards a more inclusive and supportive environment for individuals with mental health conditions. Breaking the silence and fostering open conversations about mental health is not only a matter of individual well-being but also a crucial step towards a healthier and more equitable society.",1
94,Copilot,"Urban congestion and housing shortages are two of the most pressing issues facing the Philippines today. As the country continues to urbanize rapidly, these challenges have significant implications for economic growth, social equity, and overall quality of life. This editorial explores the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to these intertwined problems.

The State of Urban Congestion
Urban congestion, particularly in Metro Manila, is a daily reality for millions of Filipinos. According to the 2023 TomTom Traffic Index, Metro Manila has the longest average travel time to traverse a 10-kilometer route among 387 cities worldwide, taking an average of 25 minutes and 30 seconds1. This congestion results in significant economic losses, estimated at around $4 billion annually due to lost productivity2.

Several factors contribute to this severe congestion:

Inadequate Public Transportation: The public transportation system in Metro Manila is often overcrowded and inefficient. Many residents resort to using private vehicles, which occupy more road space and contribute to traffic jams3.

Urban Planning Issues: The city's layout and infrastructure have not kept pace with its rapid growth. Poor urban planning has led to bottlenecks and inefficient traffic flow4.

Economic Activity Concentration: Major business districts and shopping centers are concentrated along key routes like EDSA, further increasing traffic volume in these areas4.

The State of Housing Shortages
The Philippines faces a severe housing crisis, with a backlog of approximately 6.5 million homes5. This shortage is particularly acute in urban areas, where rapid population growth and urbanization have outpaced the supply of affordable housing.

Key factors contributing to the housing shortage include:

Rapid Urbanization: As more Filipinos move to cities in search of better opportunities, the demand for housing has surged. Urban centers like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao are struggling to accommodate this influx5.

High Land Costs: The cost of land in urban areas is prohibitively high, making it difficult for low-income families to afford housing. This has led to the proliferation of informal settlements5.

Inadequate Housing Policies: Despite various government initiatives, the implementation of housing policies has been inconsistent. Bureaucratic hurdles and slow permitting processes have hindered the development of affordable housing5.

Economic Inequality: The disparity in income levels means that many Filipinos cannot afford decent housing. This inequality is reflected in the high number of informal settlers living in substandard conditions5.

Impacts of Urban Congestion and Housing Shortages
The impacts of urban congestion and housing shortages are far-reaching:

Economic Costs: Traffic congestion leads to lost productivity and increased transportation costs. It also affects the delivery of goods and services, impacting businesses and the economy2.

Health and Well-being: Prolonged exposure to traffic pollution can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. Additionally, the stress of long commutes affects mental health and overall well-being2.

Social Inequality: Housing shortages exacerbate social inequality, as low-income families are forced to live in informal settlements with inadequate access to basic services like clean water, sanitation, and electricity5.

Environmental Degradation: Urban sprawl and the lack of green spaces contribute to environmental degradation. Informal settlements often encroach on environmentally sensitive areas, leading to deforestation and pollution5.

Potential Solutions
Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multi-faceted approach:

Improving Public Transportation: Investing in efficient and reliable public transportation systems is crucial. Expanding the existing train networks, implementing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, and improving the quality of buses and jeepneys can reduce the reliance on private vehicles2.

Smart Urban Planning: Adopting smart urban planning practices can help alleviate congestion. This includes creating mixed-use developments that reduce the need for long commutes, implementing zoning laws that promote balanced development, and improving traffic management systems3.

Affordable Housing Initiatives: Increasing the supply of affordable housing is essential. Public-private partnerships can leverage funding for housing projects, while government incentives can encourage private developers to invest in low-cost housing5. Innovative solutions like modular homes and sustainable building materials can also help address the housing shortage6.

Strengthening Housing Policies: Streamlining the permitting process and reducing bureaucratic hurdles can accelerate the development of affordable housing. Ensuring that housing policies are effectively implemented and monitored is crucial5.

Community Involvement: Engaging communities in the planning and development process can lead to more sustainable and inclusive solutions. Community-led initiatives, such as cooperative housing projects and local infrastructure improvements, can empower residents and address their specific needs5.

Environmental Sustainability: Promoting environmentally sustainable practices in urban development can mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization. This includes incorporating green spaces, promoting energy-efficient buildings, and implementing waste management systems7.

Conclusion
Urban congestion and housing shortages are complex challenges that require coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and civil society. By investing in public transportation, adopting smart urban planning practices, increasing the supply of affordable housing, and promoting community involvement, the Philippines can address these issues and improve the quality of life for its citizens.

95,Copilot,"Plastic pollution is a critical environmental issue in the Philippines, posing severe threats to marine ecosystems, public health, and the economy. As one of the world's top contributors to ocean plastic waste, the Philippines faces an urgent need to address this growing crisis. This editorial examines the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to plastic pollution in the Philippines.

The Scale of the Problem
The Philippines generates approximately 2.7 million metric tons of plastic waste annually, with a significant portion ending up in the ocean1. A study by Ocean Conservancy and McKinsey identified the Philippines as the third-largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution globally1. This alarming statistic underscores the magnitude of the problem and the urgent need for effective interventions.

Causes of Plastic Pollution
Several factors contribute to the severe plastic pollution problem in the Philippines:

Single-Use Plastics: The widespread use of single-use plastics, such as sachets, bags, and bottles, is a major contributor to plastic waste. These items are often discarded after a single use, leading to significant environmental pollution2.

Inadequate Waste Management: The country's waste management infrastructure is insufficient to handle the volume of plastic waste generated. Only about 33% of waste is properly managed, with the rest ending up in landfills, rivers, and oceans3. The lack of sanitary landfills and proper waste disposal facilities exacerbates the problem4.

Urban Runoff and Improper Disposal: Urban runoff and improper waste disposal practices contribute to the leakage of plastic waste into waterways. In metropolitan areas like Manila, waste management systems are often overwhelmed, leading to significant plastic pollution3.

Economic and Cultural Factors: The ""tingi-tingi"" culture, where products are sold in small, disposable packaging, is prevalent due to economic constraints. This practice results in a high volume of plastic waste5.

Impacts of Plastic Pollution
The impacts of plastic pollution in the Philippines are far-reaching and multifaceted:

Environmental Damage: Plastic pollution poses a dire threat to marine ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion, starvation, and death3. Additionally, plastic waste damages coral reefs and mangrove forests, which are critical for coastal protection and marine biodiversity3.

Public Health Risks: The improper disposal of plastics can lead to the leaching of toxic chemicals into the soil and water, posing health risks to communities5. Microplastics, which are small plastic particles, can enter the food chain and potentially impact human health.

Economic Costs: Plastic pollution affects industries such as fishing and tourism, which are vital to the Philippine economy. The presence of plastic waste in coastal areas can lead to reduced fish stocks and a decline in tourism, resulting in economic losses for local communities5.

Social Inequality: Coastal communities, which often rely on fishing and tourism for their livelihoods, are disproportionately affected by plastic pollution. These communities face economic and health challenges due to the presence of plastic waste in their environment3.

Potential Solutions
Addressing plastic pollution in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach:

Policy Reforms: Strengthening regulations on single-use plastics and implementing incentives for businesses to adopt sustainable packaging alternatives are crucial steps. The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Act, which holds manufacturers accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, is a significant policy initiative6. This law requires businesses to manage the waste generated by their products, promoting sustainable practices.

Improving Waste Management: Enhancing waste management infrastructure is essential to reduce plastic pollution. This includes increasing the number of sanitary landfills, improving waste collection systems, and promoting recycling and materials sustainability6. Local government units (LGUs) play a critical role in managing waste at the municipal level.

Promoting a Circular Economy: Transitioning to a circular economy, where products are designed for reuse, recycling, and minimal waste, can significantly reduce plastic pollution7. This approach involves redesigning products and packaging to minimize waste and encouraging the use of biodegradable materials.

Community Engagement and Education: Raising awareness about the impacts of plastic pollution and promoting community involvement in waste management initiatives are vital. Educational campaigns can help change public attitudes towards plastic use and encourage more sustainable behaviors3.

Clean-Up Initiatives: Organizing clean-up drives and community-based waste collection programs can help remove plastic waste from the environment. These initiatives also raise awareness and foster a sense of responsibility among citizens3.

International Collaboration: Addressing plastic pollution requires global cooperation. The Philippines can benefit from sharing best practices and collaborating with other countries and international organizations to develop effective strategies for reducing plastic waste6.

Conclusion
Plastic pollution is a complex and pressing issue that demands immediate and sustained action. By implementing comprehensive policy reforms, improving waste management infrastructure, promoting a circular economy, and engaging communities, the Philippines can make significant strides in addressing this environmental crisis. Ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment is not only essential for the well-being of current and future generations but also crucial for the country's economic and social development. The fight against plastic pollution is a collective responsibility that requires the commitment and cooperation of all sectors of society.",1
96,Copilot,"The Stark Realities of Income Inequality in the Philippines: Addressing an Enduring Challenge
Income inequality remains one of the most pressing issues in the Philippines. Despite notable economic growth over the past decade, the benefits have not been equitably distributed. The resulting disparity underscores a systemic problem that threatens the country's long-term social and economic stability.

Understanding the Scope of the Issue
Income inequality, often measured by the Gini coefficient, reflects the uneven distribution of income across a population. In the Philippines, this disparity is pronounced. As of recent data, the richest 10% of the population holds over a third of the national income, while the poorest 50% share less than a fifth. This stark contrast highlights the urgent need for comprehensive reforms.

Historical Context: A Legacy of Inequity
The roots of income inequality in the Philippines can be traced back to its colonial past. Spanish and American colonization established a socio-economic hierarchy that favored a small elite class, leaving the majority of Filipinos marginalized. Post-independence, land ownership remained concentrated in the hands of a few, perpetuating economic disparities.

The agrarian reform programs, meant to redistribute land to the rural poor, have had limited success. Large landowners found ways to circumvent these reforms, and the lack of genuine support for small farmers has resulted in persistent rural poverty.

Urban-Rural Divide: A Tale of Two Economies
One of the most visible manifestations of income inequality in the Philippines is the urban-rural divide. Metro Manila, the nation's capital, is a bustling economic hub, while rural areas, particularly in Mindanao and the Visayas, lag in terms of development and opportunity.

Urbanization has driven millions to migrate to cities in search of better livelihoods. However, the influx has led to the proliferation of informal settlements, where many live in substandard conditions without access to basic services. Meanwhile, rural areas suffer from inadequate infrastructure, limited access to education and healthcare, and a lack of economic opportunities.

Education: The Great Equalizer?
Education is often touted as the great equalizer, but in the Philippines, it has also highlighted disparities. Access to quality education remains uneven, with students in urban areas and from wealthier families generally having better educational outcomes compared to their rural and poorer counterparts.

The pandemic has exacerbated this inequality. While some students managed to continue learning through online platforms, many others, particularly in remote areas, were left behind due to lack of internet access and technological resources. The digital divide has thus become a new dimension of educational inequality, further entrenching socio-economic disparities.

Employment and Wages: The Struggle for Livelihoods
Employment opportunities are another key factor in the income inequality equation. While the Philippine economy has created jobs, many of them are in low-paying, informal sectors. Workers in these sectors often lack job security, benefits, and the means to improve their livelihoods.

The minimum wage in the Philippines also varies significantly by region, reflecting cost-of-living differences but also contributing to income disparities. Moreover, wage growth has not kept pace with inflation, eroding the purchasing power of low-income earners.

Government Initiatives and Policies
The Philippine government has implemented several initiatives aimed at reducing income inequality. Conditional cash transfer programs, such as the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), have provided financial assistance to millions of poor households, helping to lift them out of extreme poverty.

However, these programs are often seen as stopgap measures rather than solutions to systemic issues. Structural reforms, including progressive taxation, improved access to quality education, and comprehensive land reform, are necessary to address the root causes of inequality.

The Role of the Private Sector and Civil Society
The private sector and civil society organizations also have crucial roles to play in addressing income inequality. Companies can contribute by adopting fair labor practices, providing living wages, and investing in community development projects. Corporate social responsibility initiatives can help bridge the gap between rich and poor.

Civil society organizations, on the other hand, can advocate for policy changes, provide social services, and empower marginalized communities through education and skills training. Their grassroots efforts are vital in creating a more inclusive and equitable society.

Moving Forward: A Collective Responsibility
Addressing income inequality in the Philippines is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. It involves not just government action but also the collective efforts of the private sector, civil society, and the international community.

Investing in human capital, promoting inclusive economic growth, and ensuring social protection for the vulnerable are essential steps towards reducing income disparity. By working together, Filipinos can build a society where opportunities are not dictated by one's socio-economic background but by one's abilities and aspirations.

Ultimately, the fight against income inequality is about creating a fairer, more just society. It is about ensuring that every Filipino has the chance to live a life of dignity and opportunity. The road ahead is long, but with commitment and collaboration, it is a journey that can lead to transformative change.",1
97,Copilot,"The Pillars of Progress: Overseas Filipino Workers and the Philippine Economy
Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) are often hailed as modern-day heroes in the Philippines. Their sacrifices, resilience, and hard work have contributed significantly to the country's economic stability and growth. As millions of Filipinos continue to seek employment opportunities abroad, their impact on the national economy remains profound and multifaceted. This editorial piece explores the contributions of OFWs to the Philippine economy, the challenges they face, and the broader socio-economic implications of this phenomenon.

The Economic Contributions of OFWs
One of the most tangible contributions of OFWs to the Philippine economy is through remittances. According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), remittances from OFWs reached over $30 billion annually in recent years, accounting for approximately 10% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). These remittances provide a vital lifeline for millions of Filipino families, helping to cover expenses such as education, healthcare, housing, and daily needs.

Remittances also play a crucial role in stimulating domestic consumption, which drives economic growth. The influx of foreign currency stabilizes the Philippine peso and enhances the country's foreign exchange reserves. This financial stability is essential for maintaining investor confidence and promoting economic development.

Job Creation and Skills Development
The migration of Filipinos for work abroad has also led to job creation and skills development within the country. Recruitment agencies, training centers, and other support services have sprung up to cater to the needs of aspiring OFWs. These institutions provide essential training and certification programs, equipping workers with the skills and knowledge required in various industries, such as healthcare, engineering, maritime, and domestic work.

Furthermore, the exposure of OFWs to international work environments and practices often leads to the acquisition of new skills and competencies. Upon returning to the Philippines, many OFWs bring back valuable expertise and experiences that can be leveraged for local development. This transfer of knowledge contributes to the overall enhancement of the country's human capital.

Addressing Unemployment and Underemployment
The high unemployment and underemployment rates in the Philippines have been long-standing challenges. The migration of Filipinos for work abroad serves as a coping mechanism, providing employment opportunities that may not be readily available domestically. For many Filipinos, working abroad offers higher wages and better working conditions compared to what they can find locally.

By seeking employment opportunities overseas, OFWs help alleviate the pressure on the domestic labor market. This, in turn, reduces the social and economic strain caused by unemployment and underemployment, contributing to overall societal stability.

The Social Costs of Labor Migration
While the economic contributions of OFWs are undeniable, it is essential to acknowledge the social costs of labor migration. The prolonged separation of OFWs from their families can lead to emotional and psychological challenges for both the workers and their loved ones. Children of OFWs may experience feelings of abandonment and struggle with behavioral and academic issues. The absence of parental guidance and support can have long-term impacts on family dynamics and child development.

Moreover, OFWs often face harsh working conditions, exploitation, and abuse in their host countries. Reports of maltreatment, contract violations, and inadequate legal protections are not uncommon. These challenges highlight the need for stronger safeguards and support systems to protect the rights and welfare of Filipino workers abroad.

Government Initiatives and Support Programs
The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives and support programs to address the challenges faced by OFWs and maximize their contributions to the economy. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) provides a range of services, including pre-departure orientation, welfare assistance, and reintegration programs. These services aim to ensure the well-being of OFWs throughout their migration journey.

Additionally, the Philippine government has established bilateral labor agreements with various countries to enhance the protection of OFWs' rights. These agreements include provisions for fair wages, decent working conditions, and mechanisms for addressing grievances. The government's efforts to engage with host countries and international organizations are critical in safeguarding the welfare of Filipino workers abroad.",1
98,Copilot,"A Critical Examination of the Philippines' Food Security: Challenges and Opportunities

In recent years, the issue of food security has become a paramount concern in the Philippines. A nation with a rich agricultural heritage and a tropical climate conducive to growing a wide variety of crops should, in theory, be able to sustain itself. However, the reality is far more complex, influenced by a myriad of socio-economic, environmental, and political factors that contribute to the country's ongoing food security challenges.

The State of Food Security in the Philippines

Food security, as defined by the United Nations, is the state in which all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and preferences for an active and healthy life. In the Philippines, achieving this ideal has been a persistent struggle.

According to the Global Food Security Index, the Philippines ranks 64th out of 113 countries, reflecting significant vulnerabilities in the country's food system. Despite being an agricultural nation, the Philippines continues to grapple with issues such as food availability, accessibility, and utilization. Poverty, natural disasters, and inadequate infrastructure further exacerbate these challenges, leaving a large portion of the population food insecure.

Agricultural Sector: Backbone or Bottleneck?

The agricultural sector is the cornerstone of the Philippines' food security. However, it has faced numerous setbacks that hinder its potential. Fragmented land ownership, outdated farming techniques, and limited access to modern technology have stunted agricultural productivity. Smallholder farmers, who constitute the majority of the agricultural workforce, often lack the resources and support needed to improve their yields.

Moreover, climate change poses a significant threat to agriculture in the Philippines. The country is highly susceptible to typhoons, floods, and droughts, which can devastate crops and disrupt food supply chains. The increasing frequency and intensity of these weather events necessitate the adoption of climate-resilient farming practices and the development of robust disaster response strategies.

Food Import Dependency

One of the most glaring indicators of the Philippines' food security challenges is its heavy reliance on food imports. While the country has the potential to be self-sufficient in staple crops such as rice and corn, it continues to import significant quantities to meet domestic demand. This dependency makes the Philippines vulnerable to global market fluctuations, trade policies, and geopolitical tensions.

To reduce this dependency, there is a pressing need to revitalize the agricultural sector. Investments in research and development, extension services, and infrastructure can enhance productivity and promote sustainable farming practices. Additionally, supporting local farmers through subsidies and access to credit can empower them to increase their output and reduce the need for imports.

Nutrition and Health

Food security is not just about the availability of food but also about its quality and nutritional value. Malnutrition remains a persistent problem in the Philippines, particularly among children. The prevalence of stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to food security that includes nutrition-sensitive interventions.

Government initiatives such as the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) and the Enhanced Nutribun project aim to address malnutrition by providing financial assistance and fortified food products to vulnerable populations. However, these efforts must be complemented by broader policy measures that promote healthy eating habits and improve access to diverse and nutritious foods.

Policy and Governance

Effective governance and policy frameworks are essential to achieving food security. In the Philippines, the complexity and fragmentation of agricultural policies have often impeded progress. A cohesive and well-coordinated approach is necessary to address the multifaceted challenges of food security.

The government has made strides with initiatives such as the Rice Tariffication Law, which aims to stabilize rice prices and boost local production. However, there is still much work to be done. Strengthening institutions, improving data collection and analysis, and fostering public-private partnerships can enhance the effectiveness of food security policies.

Innovation and Technology

Embracing innovation and technology is crucial for transforming the agricultural sector and achieving food security in the Philippines. Precision agriculture, digital tools, and biotechnology can revolutionize farming practices, increase productivity, and reduce environmental impact.

Furthermore, leveraging technology for market access and information dissemination can empower farmers and improve their livelihoods. Mobile applications and online platforms can provide real-time data on weather conditions, pest management, and market prices, enabling farmers to make informed decisions.

Community Involvement and Collaboration

Food security is a shared responsibility that requires the active involvement of all stakeholders, including government agencies, private sector, civil society, and local communities. Collaborative efforts and multi-stakeholder partnerships can drive sustainable solutions and create resilient food systems.

Empowering local communities through capacity-building programs and participatory approaches can foster ownership and ensure the sustainability of food security initiatives. Community-based organizations, cooperatives, and farmer groups play a vital role in advocating for farmers' rights, promoting sustainable practices, and facilitating knowledge exchange.

Conclusion

Achieving food security in the Philippines is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a holistic approach. While there are significant obstacles, there are also opportunities for transformative change. By addressing the structural issues in the agricultural sector, promoting sustainable practices, and fostering innovation, the Philippines can build a resilient and food-secure future.

Ultimately, food security is not just a matter of survival but a cornerstone of national development and well-being. Ensuring that every Filipino has access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food is a moral imperative and a critical step toward achieving a prosperous and inclusive society. The path to food security may be arduous, but it is a journey worth undertaking for the sake of present and future generations.",1
99,Copilot,"Bridging the Digital Divide: Accessibility of Technology in the Philippines

In the 21st century, technology has become an indispensable part of daily life, driving economic growth, education, and social connectivity. The Philippines, a nation of more than 100 million people, is no exception to this global trend. However, the country's digital landscape presents a paradox: while there has been significant progress in tech adoption, there remain substantial challenges in ensuring equitable access to technology for all Filipinos. This editorial delves into the state of technology accessibility in the Philippines, examining the opportunities and obstacles that define the nation's journey toward a more inclusive digital future.

The Digital Landscape

The Philippines has experienced rapid growth in internet penetration and mobile phone usage over the past decade. According to the Digital 2023 report by Hootsuite and We Are Social, approximately 76 million Filipinos, or around 70% of the population, have access to the internet. Moreover, the country ranks among the highest in social media usage, with Filipinos spending an average of nearly four hours daily on social networking sites.

Despite these impressive statistics, the digital divide remains a pressing issue. Access to technology is unevenly distributed, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as among different socio-economic groups. While metropolitan regions like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao boast robust digital infrastructure, many rural and remote communities still struggle with limited connectivity and access to devices.

Challenges to Technology Accessibility

Infrastructure Deficits

One of the primary barriers to technology accessibility in the Philippines is the inadequacy of digital infrastructure. Rural areas, in particular, suffer from poor internet connectivity, slow speeds, and intermittent service. The lack of reliable broadband infrastructure hampers the ability of residents in these regions to access online services, participate in e-learning, and engage in digital commerce.

Telecommunications companies have made efforts to expand their reach, but the high cost of infrastructure development in remote areas often deters comprehensive coverage. Additionally, the country's archipelagic geography presents logistical challenges in laying undersea cables and establishing reliable networks across thousands of islands.

Economic Inequality

Economic inequality further exacerbates the digital divide. The cost of internet services and digital devices remains prohibitive for many low-income households. According to a 2020 study by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), around 40% of Filipino households do not have access to the internet at home, primarily due to financial constraints.

Affordability is a critical factor in ensuring technology accessibility. Lower-income families often prioritize basic needs over digital access, which can perpetuate cycles of poverty and limit opportunities for upward mobility. Addressing this issue requires not only lowering the cost of connectivity and devices but also implementing targeted subsidies and financial assistance programs.

Digital Literacy

Beyond infrastructure and affordability, digital literacy is a key component of technology accessibility. The ability to effectively use digital tools and navigate the online world is essential for maximizing the benefits of technology. In the Philippines, there are significant gaps in digital literacy, particularly among older generations and marginalized communities.

Educational institutions play a vital role in fostering digital skills, but there is a need for comprehensive and inclusive digital literacy programs that reach all segments of society. Government initiatives, non-profit organizations, and private sector partnerships can contribute to building a digitally literate population capable of leveraging technology for personal and professional growth.

Opportunities for Inclusive Technology

Government Initiatives

The Philippine government has recognized the importance of technology accessibility and has launched several initiatives to address the digital divide. The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) has implemented programs such as the National Broadband Plan and the Free Wi-Fi for All initiative to improve connectivity in underserved areas.

Moreover, the government has partnered with private sector entities to roll out community-based digital learning centers and e-government services. These efforts aim to bring technology closer to marginalized communities and promote digital inclusion.

Private Sector Involvement

The private sector also plays a crucial role in advancing technology accessibility. Telecommunications companies, tech firms, and social enterprises have developed innovative solutions to bridge the digital divide. For instance, Globe Telecom and Smart Communications have introduced prepaid internet packages and affordable smartphones to cater to low-income consumers.

Additionally, corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives have focused on providing digital skills training and supporting local tech startups. These collaborations between businesses and communities can drive sustainable progress in technology accessibility.

Empowering Communities

Empowering local communities through grassroots initiatives is essential for achieving lasting digital inclusion. Community-led projects that address specific needs and leverage local knowledge can have a significant impact. For example, community Wi-Fi networks, where residents collectively share internet access, have emerged as a viable solution in some rural areas.

Furthermore, supporting community-based organizations and cooperatives that promote digital literacy and entrepreneurship can create ripple effects, fostering a culture of innovation and resilience.

Conclusion

The journey toward achieving technology accessibility in the Philippines is a complex and multifaceted endeavor. While there are undeniable challenges, there are also numerous opportunities to create a more inclusive digital society. By addressing infrastructure deficits, economic inequality, and digital literacy gaps, the Philippines can unlock the full potential of technology for its citizens.

Government policies, private sector initiatives, and community involvement must converge to bridge the digital divide and ensure that every Filipino, regardless of their location or socio-economic status, can access and benefit from the transformative power of technology. The path to digital inclusion is not without obstacles, but it is a journey worth undertaking for the sake of a brighter and more equitable future.",1
100,Copilot,"The Power of Youth: Shaping the Future of Philippine Politics

In recent years, the youth of the Philippines have emerged as a formidable force in the political landscape. With a population of over 110 million, the Philippines is a young nation, with nearly 30% of its citizens aged 15 to 30. This demographic shift has significant implications for the country's political future, as the youth are increasingly becoming active participants in shaping policies, advocating for change, and holding leaders accountable. This editorial explores the pivotal role of the Filipino youth in shaping the nation's politics and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

The Rise of Youth Activism

The history of youth activism in the Philippines is rich and storied. From the student movements of the 1960s and 1970s that opposed the Marcos dictatorship to the more recent mobilizations against corruption and human rights abuses, young Filipinos have consistently been at the forefront of political change. The 1986 People Power Revolution, which led to the ousting of Ferdinand Marcos, is a testament to the power of collective action, with students and young activists playing a crucial role in the movement.

Today, the spirit of activism remains alive and well among the youth. Social media has become a powerful tool for organizing and amplifying voices, allowing young Filipinos to connect, share information, and mobilize for various causes. The #BabaeAko movement, which advocates for women's rights, and the #YouthStrikePH campaign, which calls for climate action, are just a few examples of how the youth are leveraging digital platforms to effect change.

Youth Participation in Elections

The youth's influence extends beyond activism and into the electoral process. In the 2019 midterm elections, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) reported that over 20 million registered voters were aged 18 to 35, making up a significant portion of the electorate. This demographic's voting power cannot be underestimated, as their collective decisions can sway election outcomes and shape the political landscape.

Recognizing the importance of youth participation, various organizations and initiatives have been launched to encourage young Filipinos to register and vote. The National Youth Commission (NYC) and the COMELEC have partnered to conduct voter education campaigns, emphasizing the importance of civic engagement and informed voting. Additionally, youth-led groups such as the Millennials PH and YouthVote Philippines have been instrumental in promoting voter registration and turnout among their peers.

Challenges Facing Youth Engagement

Despite the growing political engagement of the youth, several challenges hinder their full participation in the political process. One of the primary obstacles is the lack of representation in government. While the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) provides a platform for youth involvement at the local level, young Filipinos are often underrepresented in higher levels of government. This lack of representation can lead to policies that do not adequately address the needs and concerns of the youth.

Moreover, socio-economic barriers can limit the political participation of young Filipinos. Poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to education can prevent many from engaging in political activities. Addressing these issues requires comprehensive policies that promote social and economic inclusion, ensuring that all young Filipinos have the opportunity to participate in the political process.

Opportunities for Youth Empowerment

Despite these challenges, there are numerous opportunities to empower the youth and enhance their role in shaping Philippine politics. Education is a critical factor in fostering political engagement. Integrating civic education into the curriculum can equip young Filipinos with the knowledge and skills needed to participate effectively in the political process. Schools and universities can also serve as venues for political discourse and debate, encouraging students to engage with current issues and develop their critical thinking abilities.

Mentorship and leadership development programs can also play a vital role in empowering young Filipinos. By providing opportunities for young leaders to learn from experienced politicians and activists, these programs can help build a new generation of informed and capable leaders. Initiatives such as the Ayala Young Leaders Congress and the Ten Outstanding Students of the Philippines (TOSP) are examples of programs that recognize and nurture young talent.

Furthermore, creating more avenues for youth representation in government can ensure that the voices of young Filipinos are heard. Expanding the scope and influence of the SK, as well as encouraging young candidates to run for office, can help bridge the gap between the youth and the political establishment. Policies that promote youth participation in decision-making processes can lead to more inclusive and responsive governance.

The Role of Technology

Technology has revolutionized the way young Filipinos engage with politics. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become essential tools for political communication and mobilization. These platforms allow young Filipinos to share their views, organize events, and hold leaders accountable. The rise of digital activism has democratized political participation, enabling even those in remote areas to join the conversation and advocate for change.

However, the digital landscape also presents challenges, such as the spread of misinformation and online harassment. Ensuring that young Filipinos have the digital literacy skills to navigate the online world responsibly is crucial. Media literacy programs and initiatives that promote critical thinking can help young people discern credible information and engage in constructive political discourse.

Conclusion

The youth of the Philippines hold immense potential to shape the nation's political future. Their energy, creativity, and passion for change are driving forces that can lead to a more inclusive and democratic society. By addressing the challenges that hinder youth participation and creating opportunities for empowerment, the Philippines can harness the power of its young population to build a brighter future.

As the country continues to navigate its political landscape, the voices of the youth must be heard and valued. Their active participation in the political process is not only a testament to their commitment to the nation's progress but also a crucial element in achieving a more just and equitable society. The future of Philippine politics lies in the hands of its youth, and their journey toward political empowerment is a journey worth supporting.",1

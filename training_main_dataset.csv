1,John Nery,"The success of the Marcos-Duterte electoral alliance in 2022 was so massive it could be said that the political equivalent of Newton’s law of inertia applied to it. A body moving at constant speed in a straight line will continue moving at constant speed in a straight line unless a force acted upon it. The alliance – if all went well, if the different parts moved at the same speed and kept to the same line – had a lock on the 2028 presidential election, which in our part of the universe determines other political possibilities. And then a force acted upon it. Now the alliance has descended into a war of the dynasties, between the Marcoses and the Dutertes, and an opening is starting to form, not necessarily for the political opposition but perhaps for a political third force led by someone like the populist, and popular, Senator Raffy Tulfo.But the reality of politics has always been messy; perhaps Newton’s laws of motion cannot really explain it. For some analysts, the break between the Marcoses and the Dutertes was inevitable; inertia was never an explanation. But some politicians believed in the alliance, and continue to do so even in the middle of the dynastic war; the law of action and reaction governs their pragmatic attempts to end it. Another way to look at the political situation today, to understand the “chaos” affecting the political class, is to borrow the theory at the heart of the popular Netflix series, 3-Body Problem, based on Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem trilogy. What is the three-body problem? The character Wang Miao explains: “It’s actually pretty simple. The reason why the sun’s motion seems patternless is because our world has three suns. Under the influence of their mutually perturbing gravitational attraction, their movements are unpredictable – the three-body problem. When our planet revolves around one of the suns in a stable orbit, that’s a Stable Era. When one or more of the other suns move within a certain distance, their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it’s orbiting, causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns. That’s a Chaotic Era. After an uncertain amount of time, our planet is once again pulled into a temporary orbit and another Stable Era begins. This is a football game at the scale of the universe. The players are the three suns, and our planet is the football.” (This excerpt is of course from the Ken Liu translation.) The three suns in the second Marcos administration are President Marcos, his older sister Senator Imee Marcos, and his cousin Speaker Martin Romualdez. We can measure their gravitational pull on the planet of Philippine politics according to three factors: the scale of rehabilitation of the Marcos legacy and name, the question of presidential succession, and the choice of primary geopolitical partner. There must be other criteria, but I suggest that these three form the core. These describe their hold on their moons, account for the difference in their orbits – and explain why the Stable Era promised by the UniTeam’s unprecedented victory has deteriorated into a Chaotic Era. Marcos legacy. I think that President Marcos understands his election in 2022 as a completion of the task his family imposed on him since at least 1995, the first time he ran for national office; he has rehabilitated the Marcos name simply by winning the office his father held for 20 years. His election created the minimum condition of rehabilitation – that the public regard his father no longer as a dictator but as “just another” president, the first Marcos – and I think he is happy to claim the win. Senator Marcos’s definition of rehabilitation is much broader. She wants public opinion to reflect how she thinks of her father, as a great man wronged by history. She wants to restore her father to an imagined gallery of greatness, and this requires nothing less than a repudiation of the Edsa People Power uprising. (On rereading, I see that my July 2022 column “The four REs of the Marcos restoration” actually tracks Imee’s position more closely than her brother’s.) For Imee, it is not enough for the first Marcos to be seen as just another president. Speaker Romualdez’s idea of rehabilitation is just as expansive, but in a different direction. He expects it to cover not only the Marcoses but the Romualdezes too. For him, the true measure of rehabilitation is if another member of their extended family succeeds his cousin. His reading has disturbed others in the political class, even those who warmly welcomed the return of the Marcoses to Malacañang, because it unnecessarily tests the boundaries of political power. One may be willing to concede power to a family for six years, but 12? Presidential Succession. Marcos continues to keep his personal relationship with his vice president warm, even in the face of outright hostility and insolent language from his predecessor the former president and the two Duterte sons. I think he is pragmatic enough to accept a Duterte as a successor, if that is the way his political interests lie; at the same time, he cannot but be open to a Romualdez or a Tulfo, for the same reason. But it seems clear that his influential wife’s counsel is what he will keep. This sub-factor is a particular sticking point with other members of the political class, especially the Dutertes. Imee Marcos was one of Rodrigo Duterte’s original supporters in his long-shot campaign for the presidency in 2016, and was instrumental in convincing Duterte’s more popular daughter Sara to run as Bongbong Marcos’s running mate in 2022. As I see it, she wants her family to honor the explicit or implied agreement with the Dutertes that made the UniTeam tandem possible in the first place: Support Sara for president in 2028. While her definition of political rehabilitation is maximalist, her understanding of the dynamic of presidential elections is much more pragmatic. She sees Sara as still the candidate to beat in 2028 AND also the president who can consolidate the gains of the Marcoses best. From all indications, Speaker Romualdez wants to become the next president. He may still run for a third term as representative of the 1st District of Leyte next year, but his long-term strategy may likely involve a Senate run in 2025. A strong showing would place him in strong contention for 2028. (See Gloria Arroyo in 1995, or Grace Poe in 2013.) The ongoing campaign to raise his profile in different congressional districts is an expensive signal; to give only one example, the constituency-serving facility set up on Kamuning Street in Quezon City, while ostensibly an alliance between the district representative and his wife Yedda Romualdez’s Tingog party-list group, features only one larger-than-life image: his. Superpower Ally. Before Marcos came to power, I thought he would continue moving in the direction set by President Duterte’s pivot to China; his family’s historical ties with Chinese leadership weighed heavily in my estimate. Instead, he has firmly redirected Philippine foreign policy back to Washington DC and the Western alliance. This must stem in part from the recognition that there is an international aspect to the project of rehabilitation; in his view, the course of cleaning up the family name runs through key Western capitals. Senator Marcos would favor a return to the Duterte China-first policy. The language she used in presenting her seven-point plan in September 2022 as Senate foreign affairs committee chair speaks of “engagement” with Beijing, but her remarks since then suggest collaboration rather than engagement, to the extent that today she is seen as the principal non-Duterte defender of China. (She resents this perception.) Romualdez has controversially accompanied the President on many of his foreign travels, in part to assert his idea of “legislative diplomacy” and his ideal of Congress as a full partner of the Executive in foreign policy. But he shares the pro-Western view of his cousin, Ambassador to the United States Babe Romualdez; donated $2 million to fund a Tagalog course in Harvard University; has consistently supported the strengthening of Philippine-American ties. As president, he would likely deepen the Philippine partnership with the United States. Chaotic era. In the last two years, the three suns have each increased in mass. Romualdez’s Lakas-CMD is now the largest single party in Congress, and he has proved that he can make Congress jump through hoops. Imee has reinforced her ties with the Dutertes, who have been welcoming former allies (such as former Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez) back into the fold; at the same time, she has leaned into her role as a dependable source, “good copy,” for the media. The President remains buoyed both by constant travel and the warm welcome of Western allies; the scope of influence of his wife Lisa Araneta Marcos has also widened. As a result, their “mutually perturbing gravitational attraction ” has also grown. The turmoil within the ruling coalition includes many celestial anomalies: a stealthy two-pronged campaign to change the Constitution; open conflict between the Senate and the House; a tightening of the net around key Duterte allies; the suddenly more substantial shadow of the International Criminal Court looming from The Hague; even more aggressive interventions by Beijing in the West Philippine Sea; ever closer ties with Washington, Tokyo, Canberra, London. All this instability can be explained simply. There are three competing centers of gravity within the extended Marcos family.",0
2,John Nery,"The war on Ninoy Aquino’s legacy is a fight the political opposition should welcome, and win. It wasn’t a surprise, but for many who recognize Ninoy Aquino’s heroism, the orchestrated attacks on his legacy on the anniversary of his assassination, subverting the very meaning of his martyrdom, still came as a shock. Maybe it was the brazenness of the deceitful counterclaims, or maybe it was the sheer scale of the networked campaign, or maybe it was the sinking sense that a new nightmare in disinformation and historical denialism had begun – but the blow that shocked many into a defensive crouch was visceral, real. Can all of that history really be denied? The fact that he was killed by Marcos’s soldiers, the fact that millions of people turned out for his funeral, the fact that his sacrifice galvanized the opposition, the fact that his death in 1983 led to the end of the Marcos regime in 1986: Can all of that be deliberately forgotten, or reinterpreted, or hashtagged away? Marcos and Duterte allies are certainly trying. The groundwork had been laid during the Duterte years, when legislation to change the name of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, the country’s main gateway, was first filed. Alarms over the possible removal of the image of Aquino on the P500 bill (part of the design since 1987) and that of his wife, the late president Cory Aquino (included in the design in 2010), were also first raised under the Duterte administration, when the Bangko Sentral initiated a new currency series that replaced heroes with Philippine flora and fauna. But the anti-Ninoy campaign grew in volume and viciousness after Ferdinand Marcos Jr. won the presidency. One of the first bills filed in the 19th Congress sought the renaming of the airport from Aquino to the man with final responsibility for his assassination, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos himself, on the mistaken assumption that Marcos built the airport. A day before the 39th anniversary of the assassination, a handful of police accounts on social media used the hashtags #NinoyNotHero (sic) and #NinoyNPA in bizarre posts that were later taken down. And on the day of the anniversary, the coordinated smear campaign against Aquino erupted into full view: He was denounced as a traitor, tagged as a communist, blamed as a destabilizer or a chaos-maker. And though the August 21 anniversary (which fell on a Sunday this year) remained a national holiday, the main institutions of government kept silent. No statements were issued. In his first State of the Nation Address the previous month, President Marcos Jr. deliberately avoided mentioning Aquino’s name; he spoke of creating “more international airports to help decongest the bottleneck in the Manila Airport.” The policy of official silence on the anniversary, then, was all of a piece.To be sure, Marcos issued Proclamation No. 42 the day after Ninoy Aquino Day, listing the official holidays for 2023; both August 21 and February 25, the anniversary of the People Power revolution that drove the Marcoses from Malacañang, were still on the list. As I wrote before, I expect it will take him three years to finally drop the two holidays.  But I could be wrong. Of the factions in the ruling coalition, there is at least one that is maximalist; it seeks to rehabilitate the father AND degrade the father’s political archrival as quickly as possible. Republic Act 9256, which declared Aquino’s death anniversary a holiday, can be repealed within a matter of months. Coalition Objectives. Why the zeal to erase Ninoy Aquino from history? Most of the parties and factions that comprise the ruling coalition, with the possible exception of the marginalized Arroyo group, are invested in reinterpreting mainstream Philippine history because a national narrative that celebrates Aquino as hero is necessarily a narrative that assumes Marcos as villain. The dictator was gravely ill on the day Aquino was killed; it is very likely that while he approved his wife Imelda’s repeated attempts to warn Aquino against coming back because of the risk of assassination, he did not directly order the killing. He must have anticipated, if not the scale, then at least the kind, of consequences you reap when you turn your rival into a martyr. But Marcos did arrest Aquino when Martial Law took effect; he did imprison Aquino for seven years on made-up charges; he did allow a military court to try, and eventually, convict, a civilian defendant; he did install a dictatorship that denied Filipinos their basic freedoms; he did create the conditions that by the early 1980s had pushed the country to the brink of social upheaval; he did manufacture a subservient military that produced the soldiers who killed Aquino. Marcos bears final responsibility for Aquino’s sprawled corpse on the airport tarmac. That that airport has borne Aquino’s name since December 1987 (through a law that was enacted without the approval of his widow, the president at that time) is a continuing reminder of that ultimate responsibility. That is why President Marcos Jr. couldn’t even say the airport’s full name; his father and his family are implicated every time the name is invoked. The Marcoses have apparently forgiven the late president Fidel Ramos for his crucial role in their ouster; they have not only forgiven their father’s defense secretary, Juan Ponce Enrile, for defecting from the Marcos regime, they have welcomed him into the official family as chief presidential legal counsel. The truth is that many of those who made the EDSA revolution happen have found ways to work with the Marcoses when they returned to political office. In that sense, EDSA as historical event is easier for the Marcos family to live with, or live down. But the Aquinos are a different matter. Ninoy Aquino and his ragtag Lakas ng Bayan party had humiliated Imelda Marcos during the 1978 Interim Batasang Pambansa elections. Aquino had repeatedly rejected Imelda’s many warnings about not coming home. He could have stayed in comfortable exile in the United States, but decided (exactly like Jose Rizal) to return home to almost certain death. That decision led to the collapse of the Marcos regime, and cemented Marcos’ historical reputation, not as the enlightened strongman he believed he was, but as the brutal dictator the assassination revealed him to be. To rehabilitate Marcos’s name and legacy, Aquino’s role in history must be degraded and denied. Opposition Opportunity. It is instructive to remember that when rumors of Aquino’s impending return circulated in 1983, the Marcos-controlled press (in an amazing display of editorial synchronicity) began printing unflattering, previously published stories about the opposition leader. Aquino before his arrest in 1972 was an easy target: rich, glib, flashy young man on the make, surrounded by bodyguards. The stories showed a man of great privilege and even greater ambition. The current campaign against him draws on this portrait – and then adds a layer of outright fabrication. The new script includes old allegations: that he was a communist (or even a founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines); that his absence during the Plaza Miranda bombing of 1971, which was aimed at his fellow Liberal Party members, proved that he was behind the act of terrorism; that he had been naturalized as a Malaysian citizen, and so on. But like Rizal, we remember Aquino because of the last 10 years of his life: seven years in prison and three years in exile changed him, we might even say purified him, and prepared him to be, in the final moment of his life, a hero. I was at that massive funeral for Aquino on August 31, 1983 – 10 years ago on Wednesday. I was one of maybe two million, maybe even three million, who escorted him to his grave. It was the largest funeral in Philippine history, and one of the largest in the world. I was also at EDSA in February 1986, when as many as four million Filipinos thronged the streets. And I was one of the 16.6 million who voted for the 1987 Constitution: an astonishing 77% of all votes cast. I believed then, and I believe now, that all those millions saw Aquino’s sacrifice as a martyrdom, and Aquino as a hero. The bracing thing: Lots of proof exist that Filipinos see Aquino as a hero. Many of the millions who turned out for his funeral or flocked to EDSA and other urban centers elsewhere in the country are still alive; many archives are accessible and easy to use. In other words, the question whether Aquino is a hero, which Marcos and Duterte allies have seeded, is actually a contest that the political opposition should join willingly, because it is winnable. In its present state, the opposition is defensive by default. The war to define Aquino’s heroic legacy, centered on the principle that the Filipino is worth dying for, is an opportunity to go on the offense, to convert hearts and minds, to speak truth with power.

3,John Nery,"One of many lessons from the ongoing Twitter fiasco: Billionaires make up, and bankers believe, all kinds of bullshit. To buy Twitter, Elon Musk had to pay not only the $44-billion acquisition price but also what are called closing costs. The total amount was substantially higher: $46.5 billion. A consortium of major banks, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and Bank of America, provided Musk with almost $13 billion in debt financing. In other words, aside from putting up his own money (largely by selling Tesla stock) and convincing investment funds to take a stake, Musk had to take out a loan. At around the time the acquisition was completed, at the end of October, the banks were already looking at a potential loss of half a billion dollars if they had sold their debt then. Now, according to a Reuters report based on a Financial Times story, the banks are looking to hold on to their debt (that is, not sell them off), having “conceded they will be stuck holding the debt on their books for months or even longer and will probably end up incurring huge losses on the financing package.” Question: How was it possible that ostensibly responsible bankers approved a multi-billion-dollar loan that started losing value the moment the loan was cleared? For ordinary people like you and me, these sums are unreal. Is there any difference between $1 billion and $13 billion, or $44 billion, for the proverbial man or woman on the street? But we presume that bankers (and investors, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs) appreciate the true weight of money. Why then did these bankers back a businessman who did not in fact want to proceed with the acquisition and had to be forced by litigation to complete the purchase? Magical thinking. The answer must lie in a form of collective magical thinking: These bankers and investors believed in Musk, despite the lack of substance in and even the absurdity of his plans for improving Twitter’s business prospects. Last May, the New York Times obtained a copy of the presentation slides – the pitch deck – that Musk used to court investor support for buying Twitter. He projected that from a base of around 7,500 employees, the Twitter workforce would grow to 9,225 this year and to 11,072 in 2025. And yet one of the first things Musk did when he took over Twitter was to fire half of the staff. Over 1,200 more employees resigned after he set a deadline. How can Musk possibly make good on his other grandiose plans for Twitter? He has less than a third of the work force he said needed to be in place by this year. And it’s not as if Musk’s drastic moves were a surprise. His track record at Tesla, the electric-vehicle manufacturer, and at SpaceX, the rocket business, should have warned  bankers and investors that self-created chaos was his playbook. Musk “clearly thrives in existential circumstances,” a former Tesla engineer told the Times. Musk told investors that by 2028 he would grow Twitter’s user base from 217 million in 2021 to 931 million; transform the platform’s payments business from a projected and paltry $15 million in 2023 to about $1.3 billion; and raise company revenue from $5 billion in 2021 to $26.4 billion. These numbers are literally incredible: hard to believe, or even credit. This is the business bullshit that the bankers bought? This is the BS that magical thinking sold. Never mind the Qatari or Saudi investors, who may only need to answer to their sovereigns, but what about the suits in Morgan Stanley, who agreed to loan Musk about $3.5 billion? Do they still have a job? Market mentality. I suppose the answer here is the other side of Musk’s track record; bankers and investors can point to his success at Tesla and at SpaceX. But the free market these capitalists supposedly believe in has in fact been driving down the value of Tesla for a year already. Just last Monday, Bloomberg reported that Musk’s net worth shrank by $8.6 billion. He lost more wealth in one day than the entire fortune of the single richest person in the Philippines, Manny Villar. In the first 11 months of the year, Musk’s net worth fell by an astonishing $100.5 billion – equivalent to about one-fourth of the Philippine GNP. The scale is staggering in itself, but the losses are something else. The cause is clear enough. Fortune magazine noted that since November 2021, when Musk’s wealth was at its peak, “Tesla’s stock has fallen more than 59% as growing recession fears, slowing EV demand, and Musk’s Twitter acquisition have weighed on investors’ confidence.” Tesla is the main source of Musk’s wealth. Aside from internal problems (the most recent recall involved 300,000 cars with a factory defect) and economic difficulties (more expensive raw material, more restrictive China market), Tesla also has to contend with Musk’s new acquisition, Twitter. Some investors “worry that Tesla’s strategy may fall to the wayside” (Fortune); other investors fear that “the billionaire is spreading himself too thin” (Bloomberg). But the real problem is that, in late capitalism, billionaires can lay it on too thick—and bankers, investors, venture capitalists are only too willing, too gullible, to believe them. ",0
4,John Nery,"Of course we all need to be particular about the source of the funds. That is the most important issue. As if to demonstrate the great decline in stature from chief justice of the Supreme Court to ad interim executive secretary and thus temporary chief aide, Lucas Bersamin spent a lot of time in his first press briefing on Tuesday, October 4, offering ridiculous rationalizations for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s weekend getaway to Singapore. The former chief justice did not act at all like a circumspect judge, conscious of the responsibility all public officials bear toward public office. The new executive secretary also did not act any different from the old one, who was accused (even by supporters of President Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte) of a high-handedness born of sheer proximity to power. Instead, Executive Secretary Bersamin made assertions to justify the President’s junket that even law students would have readily picked apart. He prefaced his remarks by saying that he did not have “direct knowledge” of how the President’s trip to Singapore to catch the Formula 1 race was funded. If he was reciting in class, his professor would have ripped this admission wide open. He must have known he would be asked about the Singapore trip; why didn’t he prepare beforehand by determining the source of the funding? Either he was lazy, or unprepared, or irresponsibly incurious. It’s also possible that he made the admission as a way to distance himself from the issue, an attempt to put his answers on less authoritative ground. If he did in fact make that bet, the headlines and stories in the wake of his press briefing show that he wagered wrong. But his admission was merely laying the predicate for his first rationalization: “You don’t need to be too particular about where the funds were sourced.” This is atrocious nonsense, based on the unsaid but false assumption that the President is exempt from standards applied to other public officials. In fact, Bersamin tried to justify this nonsense by referring, broadly, to the implied deference the Administrative Code of 1987 pays, or so he says, to the entire First Family. But nothing in the same Code, or indeed in any other law, says that the basic principle that “public office is a public trust” does not hold for the President and the First Family. Of course we all need to be particular about the source of the funds. That is the most important issue (but, significantly, not the only one). The distinction between the private person and the public official is a measure of political modernity; we no longer make the mistake of thinking that the office is the man. If President Marcos incurs an expense in his private capacity – for instance, buying a ticket to an Eric Clapton concert, or indulging an addiction to nicotine – he must pay for it out of his own pocket. That’s what his salary is for; that’s where his family’s private wealth, the subject of unending litigation, comes in. To say, blithely, as Bersamin did, that the source of funding is “irrelevant,” is to do violence to the constitutional principle of accountability. Bersamin suggested that even he could have paid for the President’s travel, if only he had the money, and it would have been okay. Again, arrant and dangerous nonsense.  If, to follow his own example, he did pay for the President’s trip, then he should be ready to stand accused of buying his new position. Private time. Bersamin’s second rationalization was that the President was on “private time.” He said: “It’s not immodest, it’s not contrary to morals, private time ‘yan.” He was preemptively answering possible ethical questions that could be raised against the President based on principles enshrined in the Constitution and the laws, but he was only indulging in a non-sequitur. Just because an official does something on private time, it doesn’t mean that what he does is necessarily modest, or not contrary to morals. “Private time” doesn’t cover a multitude of sins. And even if, to borrow Bersamin’s own strained metaphor, Marcos Junior had become a “matinee idol” whose very presence at the race added “some suspense and intrigue and some importance to that event,” that new-found celebrity still would not protect the President if he were to commit a crime or a scandal during his own private time. But in fact Bersamin used the private time argument in bad faith, because he had a third rationalization that ran opposite the second. The President, the former justice said, “was still performing his job as President when he was abroad, although that is not an official state visit.” It is easy enough to see how vapid this reasoning is, when you apply it to actual and specific examples. When Marcos watched the Clapton concert, was he still performing his job as President? When he spent hours soaking in the expensive atmosphere of an F1 race, was he doing so as part of his presidential duties? Questions like these are why Bersamin offered the private time argument, but as chief aide he thought it was necessary to add the exact opposite argument, just to cover all the bases. What a disgrace. But he didn’t stop there. To try to deflect public outrage over the President’s insensitive partying in Singapore, at a time when many had not yet recovered from the last typhoon, Bersamin said it was the criticism of the President’s visit that was insensitive. “Yun ang insensitive, yung criticism.” When an avatar of the rule of law is the first to attack the public’s inherent right to criticize erring public officials, he has lost his bearings and has no business serving in government. The irony is that he even thought his own person could serve as the clincher to the argument that the source of funding was irrelevant. But it didn’t – because there was nothing there.",0
5,John Nery,"In 'Some People Need Killing,' the acclaimed journalist's searing, searching account of Rodrigo Duterte’s calamitous 'war on drugs,' we come face to face with the enormity of evil – and the language that enables it. Rodrigo Duterte was the only candidate for Philippine president who promised to kill thousands of his potential voters to solve what he called a drug crisis; he would fill Manila Bay with the corpses of as many as a hundred thousand drug addicts, he said. Once voted into office, he made good on that promise. Some People Need Killing, the journalist Patricia Evangelista’s much-anticipated account of Duterte’s promised war on drugs, includes in its breadth of detail and casualty count and dramatic incident some of those very Duterte voters who ended up killed in Duterte’s war. There is even an entire chapter on Duterte supporters consumed by regret. This may have been an effort on Evangelista’s part to end her harrowing, thoughtful, absorbing account on a less bleak note, but she is above all else a reporter, and her faithful reporting does not sugarcoat reality. Thousands of extrajudicial killings had changed the country irrevocably. A nation of martyrs has become a country of killers. Some of the early vigilantes called it right. We are Duterte, they said. Evangelista’s account is a memoir of her coverage of the EJKs and what led her to it (it is subtitled “A Memoir of Murder in My Country”); but it is also reportage, some new and some already published but expanded, filled with even more detail and drawn with more context, all of it reworked into a whole; it is, lastly, an analysis, of how a democracy can die. Much of that analysis reflects a writer’s sensibility. Evangelista, in the field, looks for the telling detail or the outrageous fact; at her writing table, she looks for the enabling word, the language that kills. In this review’s lead paragraph, for instance, she will likely seize on the idiomatic irony of “making good on” a promise of evil, and write a thoughtful paragraph or page on how ostensibly moral phrasing can subvert morality. Since her twenties, Evangelista has had a reputation for beautiful writing. (It isn’t true, as she asserts in a self-effacing passage, that she was hired to write a column by the Philippine Daily Inquirer only because of her youth.) Her stories from the war on drugs, especially those in Part II, will add to that reputation. “Marcelo worked as a truck driver’s assistant. He lived, with his partner and three children, in a house just a few feet from the shanty where his mother had given birth to him thirty-one years earlier. Unlike many of the Payatas settlements, the Daa home sat in a remote clearing, requiring a long walk downhill from the main highway, through a patch of woods where the thick canopy of trees did little to mask the stench of the nearby dump site. The Daas lived in a lonely huddle of squat houses pieced together from tarps and plywood, their tin roofs weighed down by large rocks and washbasins and a chipped Blue’s Clues doorstop lying on its side. A sixty-foot ravine curved around the edges.” Comparing this paragraph with the original and already fine description, in the Rappler series in which it appeared, the reader can see that the phrasing has tightened, even though more detail had been added. And the reworking of that last sentence, cutting it just so, reflects and raises the tension in that story. But her account also includes passages like these (this one is on “salvage” in Philippine English): “Salvage-as-murder does not exist in most Filipino dictionaries. Nor does the definition appear in the many English-Filipino compendiums that are available for academic use. But every child in my country knows this meaning …. A salvage yard is not a fenced-in path of concrete with secondhand cars and vintage lamps for thrifting. A salvage yard is a street corner in Tondo, or the right lane of an overpass at dawn. A salvage yard is a cemetery, unless there is no one to give the dead man a name.” It is this attention to both detail and diction that sets Evangelista’s work apart. Doing the inconceivable. “I spent much of my time sorting through the convoluted grammar of official police reports,” she writes, in another characteristically self-deprecating self-description. But out of this basic step, Police Beat Reporting 101, she captures the accidental anti-poetry of bureaucratic language, which makes the inconceivable doable. For instance: “Cops [in a buy-bust operation] use the same word for fulfillment as is used for newlyweds: consummation. ‘After the consummated transaction,’ read one police report, ‘poseur-buyer and companion arrested the suspect.’” Another instance: “In the black-and-white of a Philippine spot report, ‘suspect sensed presence of lawmen’ comes just before ‘suspect drew his firearm’.” On August 15, 2017, in what became colloquially known as a One Time Big Time operation, 32 persons were killed in one province alone. At least eight spot reports filed by the police struck a variation of the same theme of presence sensed. Evangelista quotes the reports, and presents them one after the other. “At 12.20 a.m., suspects Bernard Lizardo and Justine Bucacao, ‘after sensing that they were dealing with an undercover police poseur’ …. At 12.40 a.m., suspects Jimmy Gorgon and Bartolome Marin ‘sensed the presence of operatives’.” And so on, until 4.30 am. The cumulative effect is both hilarious and horrifying. And yet another instance: “There is a phrase that has been used whenever police officers sit down to brag about their prowess in the field. It is also a phrase that appears in a certain species of police report …. The suspect is discovered dead, or almost dead, but that discovery occurs only after ‘the smoke of gunfire subsides.’ In Binondo … ‘after the smoke of gun battle subsided’ two suspects were ‘seen sprawled lifeless inside the rooms of the small house.’ In Santa Cruz, ‘when the smoke of gunfire subsided,’ police reported the subject ‘lay in the cemented pavement mortally wounded’. The same is true for a man in Tondo, found dead just after ‘the smoke of gunfire subsided,’ and in Jose Abad Santos, where another subject was found lying on another cemented pavement dead of gunshot wounds—‘after the smoke of gunfire subsided’.” Duterte, more rambling than a police report but with straighter grammar, comes under the same scrutiny. Evangelista’s “sorting” of the President’s speech is a series of compelling compilations, a Greatest Hits collection, of violent rhetoric. She recounts what amounts to Duterte’s origin story, as the man with the iron hand (she carefully indicates, in one of her fastidious endnotes, that Duterte had related this story at least six times). It involves his encounter as a new mayor of Davao City with the unrepentant rapist of an 18-month-old baby. The rapist, asked why he did it, gave a truly monstrous answer. “If that’s the answer you get,” Duterte asked, “what will you do?” But he never did say exactly what he did to the rapist. Just that “I did do something,” with a new revolver he had received for Christmas. Don’t blame him, the President said, “if I am driven also to insanity.” In another 11 speeches, Duterte claimed that 77,000 people had died in the hands of drug addicts in the three to four years before his election. “You know, in the wake of the drug contamination in the Philippines, 77,000 deaths, drug-related. Who will answer for that? Who will take the cudgels for those innocent—the young women raped? The ones held up in jeepneys—who will answer for them?” (Evangelista quickly and completely debunks Duterte’s mistaken statistics.) But the point of all the alleged numbers was dehumanization: “A lot of them are no longer viable as human beings in this planet,” he said. In another seven speeches, at least, “His Excellency Rodrigo Duterte, commander in chief, ordered his own men to violate not just the spirit but the letter of the law.” Shoot the suspect, he said, or hinted at it – and he said it again and again, in Davao City, in Davao again but in another venue, in Clark Freeport, in Marawi City, again in Davao, in Quezon City, in the presidential palace. Language as an enabler. In a particularly provocative passage that runs over four pages, Evangelista questions her own translation of the Filipino word for “beautiful,” in posting about Duterte’s monstrous response to the One Time Big Time operation in Bulacan province, which killed 32 suspects in one night. Of the death toll, the President had said, “Maganda yun.” In her social media, Evangelista posted her translation of the President’s words: “That’s good.” In Some People Need Killing, Evangelista writes: “In Filipino, maganda means ‘beautiful.’ It can also mean ‘good.’ It was unclear what the President meant that afternoon in August, but there was a reason every English-language local news organization chose to use the word good instead of beautiful. Good, as egregious a judgment as it was, was far less outrageous than beautiful. Beautiful would have offered an element of pleasure, a romanticizing of brutality, the impression that the commander in chief of a democratic republic  was not just pleased but delighted by the ruthless killing of his citizens.” What follows is an extraordinary list of the many things that Duterte had called beautiful in public. Perhaps nothing catches both Duterte’s appeal as a leader and the anomaly of his leadership so accurately – and yes, even beautifully – as the list Evangelista put together. It includes the President’s older girlfriend (“more beautiful than the other one”), his sidearm, Melania Trump, his circumcised penis, bodies that “only had one bullet hole in each head” – and yes, 32 suspects killed in one night. If those are the answers you get, what will you do? Evangelista suggests we must pay attention to the normalization of abusive or violent language, because it can quickly become the rhetoric of authoritarian return. Several stories stand out in Evangelista’s account: The fifth man, the tragedy of Heart de Chavez, the bizarre police friend, the slapping of Djastin with a D. The build-up to her one encounter with the vigilante leader known familiarly as Commander Maning is well-paced and thrilling (and differs markedly from the original Rappler series). Only the second chapter seemed to me to be weak; Philippine history was painted with too broad a brush. But I counted 11 instances when her stories, or her writing, stopped me momentarily – and the first of these, a revelation about her grandfather, was in that second chapter. Another passage that stopped me: Her disquisition on the transformation of the word “laban” or fight, associated with the opposition leader Ninoy Aquino, to “nanlaban,” or fought back, now forever part of the enabling language of the war on drugs. She also provides checklists, of a sort. For the aspiring journalist, two pages worth. For the aspiring vigilante, three. The enormity of evil requires more space.

6,John Nery,"It should be a no-brainer, right? It’s right there in the name we use to identify the various groups: pro-democracy. But while preserving what remains of the democratic space is the primary objective, the bitter truth is “democracy” and “rule of law” are not winning messages. Even in the “snap elections” of 1986, Cory Aquino did not defeat Ferdinand Marcos on a restoration-of-democracy message; rather, the message after 20 years of Marcosian misrule was, simply, change. “Tama na, sobra na, palitan na.”

The idiomatic English equivalent, “We’ve had enough, this is too much, it’s time to change it,” lacks the punch of the original, but it has the advantage of reminding us that the last five years of abuse, bloodshed, cruelty, democratic erosion, and failure have brought us back to 1986: We really have had enough of the incompetence; the brutality is too much; it really is time to reject the incumbent. But, as I argued in “How to take our country back” (1/5/21), “this greater constituency goes beyond being anti-Duterte.” The role of the political opposition is “to help” this still inchoate mass of aggrieved citizens, desperate for governance that is worthy of their sacrifices, their very citizenship, “imagine itself.”

On March 18, a new electoral coalition that spans the ideological spectrum from Bayan Muna on the left to Magdalo on the right, led by personalities who help define the center of Philippine politics, will be launched. I am not involved with 1Sambayan (I cannot be, as I take my limitations as a journalist seriously), but I have touched base with some of the coalition leaders. Their objective, in a word, is to help pro-democracy forces make common cause—by helping form a complete slate for national office. The main convenors, who include former justice Antonio Carpio, former ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales, and former foreign secretary Albert del Rosario, pillars of the political center, are working to create the conditions that will help the coalition support common candidates for president, vice president, and a full 12-person Senate slate.

They have conducted exploratory and, from what I hear, truly candid conversations with many potential presidential candidates not aligned with the Dutertes. Some of those candidates may not even wish to claim the mantle of the opposition (in this light, please read my reflections on “Who is opposition?” 2/23/21), but even as I do not personally agree with some of the possible choices, this is what it means to pitch a big tent.

This new coalition bears watching. But it’s not the only one preparing to choose, or position, a presidential candidate as not aligned with the Dutertes. We Need A Leader 2022 released a slick music video yesterday, featuring the iconic musician Ely Buendia singing a catchy (and accurate) critique of the present government (but without naming President Duterte). The video was quickly taken off

YouTube by its creators, but it is clear that the main politician behind We Need A Leader is former speaker Pantaleon Alvarez. The enmity with Davao Mayor Sara Duterte has reached a point where Alvarez is preparing to add his still considerable resources behind yet another candidate from Mindanao. But if he is backing Manny Pacquiao, the question is: Does the famous boxer represent change, or continuity?

At last week’s news conference by petitioners in the Anti-Terror Law cases (as I have written before, I am also a co-petitioner), a short statement was read by colleague and columnist Ceres Doyo, herself a petitioner. Here are some excerpts:
We are petitioners in the Anti-Terror Law cases, representing different petitions, and we are deeply concerned about the continuing and unprecedented series of attacks on our lawyers. [The previous] week’s barbaric attempt on the life of one of our counsel, Attorney AK Guillen, in Iloilo City, proves that the danger the Anti-Terrorism Law represents to society is not only clear and present; it is happening now…

We urge the Supreme Court to come to the defense of all lawyers. In 2007, in the wake of a series of extrajudicial killings that had terrorized the nation, the Court convened a national consultative summit. Out of that summit, in what the Chief Justice at that time, Reynato Puno, called “a conspiracy of hope,” the Court instituted the writs of amparo and habeas data. In engaging Chief Justice Puno as a friend of the court in the ATL cases, we hope that the Court will be emboldened with the same sense of initiative and purpose, and provide all lawyers with a stronger shield with which to protect themselves. But we also appeal to the Supreme Court to issue a temporary restraining order on the Anti-Terror Law now. Our plea is based on logic; the law legitimizes attacks on critics and their defenders. But it is also based on experience—the harrowing experience of human rights being deliberately ignored by agents of the State, innocent civilians (non-combatants all) red-tagged, lawyers painted broadly with a target on their back. TRO the Terror Law now.",0
7,John Nery,"The attempt on the life of lawyer Angelo Karlo Guillen in Iloilo City on March 3 was particularly brutal: He was stabbed with a screwdriver in the head and in other parts of his body, and when paramedics brought him to the hospital (as veteran correspondent Nestor Burgos reported) the blue and yellow screwdriver was still embedded in his left temple. The human rights lawyer is now in stable condition; he is the fourth member of the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers to survive an assassination attempt under the Duterte administration. But assassins on a motorcycle did reach a founding member of NUPL, Benjamin Ramos; he was shot dead in November 2018 in Kabankalan City.

Ramos was one of 56 lawyers killed since July 2016, when President Duterte took power. NUPL itself prepared a list; in July 2020, its list had 50 names on it, with Jovencio Senados, a senior city prosecutor in Manila, the latest victim entered into it. Rappler has updated the list to 56; Winston Intong of Malaybalay, Bukidnon, the 56th and latest victim, was killed in January 2021.
Some of the lawyers on this kill list were human rights lawyers (such as Ramos), environmental lawyers (like Mia Mascariñas Green, ambushed in Bohol in February 2017), public prosecutors (like Senados, or Madonna Joy Ednaco Tanyag, stabbed in Quezon City in June 2018, when she was five months pregnant), or counsel of accused drug traffickers (like Jonah John Ungab, killed in Cebu in February 2018).

Nine of the victims were judges, including two retired judges and one retired Court of Appeals justice; 11 were prosecutors or public attorneys, either still in government service or retired; six were lawyers in Cebu City (with a seventh killed in Cebu province).
I cannot remember another time when so many lawyers were killed in such a short span of time: As of January 2021, we have a total of 56 victims in 55 months, or a rate of one per month. The Marcos years were a terrible time, but there was nothing like this then. And what has the first lawyer-president since Ferdinand Marcos said about this slow-motion massacre? Not a word.

I do not know most of the lawyers on the kill list; I do not know whether most of them were good lawyers or good persons. But it doesn’t matter. The existence of the list itself fills me with dread. We are used to lawyers serving as our protectors, our defenders in court and our champions outside it. As the idiom goes, they have our back. The first five years of the Duterte administration have shown us, however, just how vulnerable our own protectors are.
AFP vows to help secure Edsa anniversary rites
We have spoken of how the administration has weaponized the rule of law, turned it into a blunt weapon of intimidation or injustice. The killing of lawyers that has been enabled these last five years proves that the rule of law can also be attacked the old way: by assassinating the agents of the court.

A HIGH POINT. Journalist Lady Ann “Icy” Salem and trade unionist Rodrigo Esparago were finally freed last Friday, after three months in unjust detention, when Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court Judge Monique Quisumbing Ignacio ordered their immediate release. Her order was one of those rare sightings: A ruling that was not only well-argued but well-written, with clarity as the organizing principle, and with no comma, or punctuation mark, out of place.

The following, for instance, may seem unremarkable, except that the simplicity of the telling is a result of clear logic and transparent writing. After noting specific “material details” whose inconsistencies and contradictions negated probable cause, Ignacio wrote: “These are not on trivial matters. Perhaps the color of the wall of the condominium unit or what Salem or Esparago were wearing can be considered trivial. But certainly details which touch on the existence of the subject firearms, ammunition, and explosives and possession by accused of these items cannot be regarded as minor or trivial. They are the very elements of the crimes for which they are being charged.”

If I read the Order right, Ignacio also hinted at the undue burden a slipshod prosecution places on the court. “And even if we brush aside these conflicting statements and testimonies and apply the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions, the prosecution must be reminded that the court still has to formulate a coherent statement of facts that will form the basis of its finding of probable cause. In these cases, the court simply cannot do so.”

FATHER B. I played a small part in getting Fr. Joaquin Bernas SJ to write for the Inquirer. Early in 2005, opinion editor Jorge Aruta asked me to sound off the great constitutionalist if he would consider writing for the newspaper. He was university president when I was in college, so there was that connection. But I was also under the impression that Father Bernas had a history of some sort with the Inquirer; perhaps there would be a need to first smoothen things out. With the help of a good friend who was teaching at the Ateneo Law School, Atty. Vannie Vallente, an early morning meeting in the Ateneo Rockwell campus was arranged. Would you like to write for us, I finally asked. Why not, Father Bernas replied. And then we were off, laughing and telling stories. There was no history to smoothen, only an appointment with my editor to set. Father Bernas had a sharp intellect, but he was also down-to-earth and irrepressibly witty. He graced our pages with his wisdom; he blessed our lives with his warmth.",0
8,John Nery,"Last week, for the first time since the pandemic collapsed like a straightjacket on an unprepared country, Sen. Leila de Lima attended her ongoing trial for alleged conspiracy to commit drug trading. It was the first time she was seen in public in almost a year, and I must admit that seeing the images of the opposition senator that filled social media on Feb. 9 — wearing a mask and a face shield, extending her right arm for the remote thermometer, waving at her physically distanced supporters — moved me deeply.

In a personal way, it reminded me of the Nelson Mandela moment many in my generation remember best. When the great South African dissident was released in 1990 after 27 years in prison, I was struck by how imposing, how regal, he looked. Like many others, I guess, I expected him to look like a broken man, diminished by injustice, but instead he radiated strength. When he emerged, dapper in his suit and dignified in his bearing, he looked like he had mastered fate itself.

It has been a year or so since I last visited Senator De Lima in her detention quarters in Camp Crame; having seen her graciously receive her visitors, speak forthrightly after Mass, display a lively sense of humor, keep up to date with the latest news affecting her beloved country, and write her notes and letters in bright blue ink, I knew that the rank injustice she has suffered had not broken her. Many of those who visit her to comfort her in her time of need leave feeling comforted instead, by her air of serenity, and at the same time strengthened by the unmistakable steel in her soul.

Still, seeing her after a year and even if only through pictures on social media, I was touched by her presence: She looked unchanged, serene but still steel-strong, and in good spirits. Here, truly, is a martyr of Philippine politics: harassed in the corridors of Malacañang and the halls of Congress; demonized by fake sex-video accusations; arrested on trumped-up drug-related charges; victimized, twice, by a pusillanimous Supreme Court (the first time when it refused to protect her after prosecutors changed the case against her without conducting a new preliminary investigation, the second time when it refused to protect her in her habeas data petition against the President); abused by a justice system that stretched her cases over many years despite fatally weak evidence. And yet there she was, fighting the good fight.
She is a martyr, but her continuing martyrdom must be understood not only in Christian terms, as the power to suffer, but also in Rizalian light. We must prove, Rizal said, that “we are superior to our misfortune,” and De Lima, who will mark four years in unjust detention next week, is yet more proof that we can master our fate.

Also last week, Vice President Leni Robredo addressed all election talk as premature. I think the Vice President is wrong. The elections ARE near; certificates of candidacy must be filed in a mere eight months. The right time to start preparing for the 2022 elections was yesterday. There is a natural logic to her reasoning, of course. “I have to admit that, in the deluge of work we face every day… for me, at least in our office, we’re just doing our jobs. I don’t think it’s right that I should prioritize politics in a time of crisis.” This is Robredo’s character, a personal approach to public office shared with and shaped by her late husband, Secretary Jesse Robredo.

But it is precisely because we are in a time of deepening crisis (even President Duterte says so, with his talk of an economy “sinking deeper and deeper”) that we should prioritize politics. Because it has become clear that the solution to our many grave problems must also be political. The administration self-evidently cannot hack it; its political coalition must be replaced in the 2022 elections. Last December, in “Take our country back,” I argued that the “true scope of the opposition to what President Duterte is doing to the Philippines is not limited to the political; the only way the political opposition can do its part to take our country back is to welcome and work with all those who want to return home.” I think that reading still stands.

What this means, firstly, is that the choice of opposition presidential candidate cannot be the decision of the Liberal Party alone. Akbayan has its work cut out for it: Ensure the reelection of Sen. Risa Hontiveros and return Akbayan to the House of Representatives through the party list system. The leftist party list groups have never fielded a candidate for national office who drew 7 million votes; that’s only half of what a winning senatorial candidate needs today. Various civil society groups are raring to take to the hustings, but for all their energy, their anger at the “change scamming” of the last five years, they need to work with established players. 

That’s the role of the Liberal Party — but the party must recognize that its thorough defeat in 2019 means it must relearn its place in the system. Recognizing the plain fact that Robredo is the true leader of the (still weak, still disorganized) opposition, the Liberal Party must allow the Vice President to serve as convenor of a wide alliance of political forces. She must personally convene this alliance at the soonest time, work with them to complete a full, 12-person slate of senatorial candidates (including reelectionists De Lima, Hontiveros, and Kiko Pangilinan, and ex-senators Bam Aquino, Sonny Trillanes), forge linkages with local governments and likely candidates in friendly regions, draft a common platform with proven popular appeal (including pushback against Chinese aggression and a new legislative franchise for ABS-CBN), and begin raising funds. Not least, she must decide, soon, whether she will accept her fate as presidential candidate.",0
9,John Nery,"What we call negative historical revisionism … is based entirely on the intent to deceive, to mislead, to cause harm. It is stained right through with the color of malice. In that sense, negative historical revisionism IS disinformation. It is not an exercise in seeking and telling the best obtainable version of the truth; rather, it is an attempt to defend power… I share the view of some historians that the better term for negative historical revisionism is historical denialism. Denialism is not a mere alternative reading of reality; rather, it is a reading of an alternative reality. It denies history as it happened, and proposes a counter-factual history.

What are the conditions which allow historical denialism to take root? In 2015—that is to say, before Rodrigo Duterte became president and before Ferdinand Marcos Jr. almost became vice president—I identified five factors that enabled Marcosian distortions of history. “Why is it that some Filipinos—not only those who are too young, but even those old enough to have lived through the Marcos years—seem ready to buy into this counter-factual version of history?”

“Many factors must be at work. The loss of perspective: The events have receded into what is now the distant past (more years separate our time from the declaration of martial law than from the start of World War II to military rule in 1972). The failure of education: Our generation has not done an adequate job of reminding the nation of the atrocities of the Marcos dictatorship. The power of myth: Marcos allies have been successful in presenting the beginning of an alternative history, especially online. The relativism of protest: Antigovernment critics of whatever stripe fall into the relativist habit of denouncing the incumbent president as the worst of the time (scroll through newspaper pages and see the vilification of one president after another: Aquino, Ramos, Estrada, Arroyo, Aquino again). Not least, the lure of innocence: Media organizations today are too noisy, busy with present-day stories of iniquity and inequality.” We can group these factors under a common label: historical, cultural, systemic conditions.

The loss of perspective is a function of time; in less than two years, we will be marking the 50th anniversary of Marcos’ imposition of martial rule. That IS a long time, by the measure of human memory. How many of the 40 million Filipinos living in 1972 are still around today?
The failure of education. It is difficult to justify sweeping statements about the quality of Philippine education, but perhaps the following assertion is non-controversial: Successive generations were taught that the Marcos regime was like any other administration, but with some excesses. If these were discussed, they would be compared to those of other administrations: as centralized as Quezon’s, as corrupt as Quirino’s. The right approach should have been to treat the Marcos years like the Japanese Occupation: an aberration, a self-occupation.

The relativism of protest. The fatal uniqueness of the Marcos regime becomes harder to see because of the lack of contrast with other administrations, in part because the protests that have criticized each succeeding administration use largely the same terminology. Every president since Marcos has been denounced on the streets as a dictator; the overuse cheapens the language, and blurs the distinctions.

The lure of innocence. I could have chosen a more direct term, but in using this phrase, I only meant that the media industry is structurally designed to pursue the latest, the newest, stories, especially of “iniquity and inequality.” The bias is for the new. That means that, on a system level, many of the older stories of investigations and controversies wither on the vine for lack of attention. The failure to follow up—consistently, comprehensively, as a matter of course—is one of the greatest failings of the media as a profession.

That leaves the power of myth as the fifth factor. On reflection, we can see that this is actually two conditions in one. The first aspect is focused on myth. Our national culture rewards simplified narratives, even for instance in acknowledged masterpieces such as the movie “Heneral Luna”: “of one against many, of country before self, of nation above class, of good versus evil.”

The man on horseback is a powerful narrative; the compassionate widow is a potent symbol.
But other than historical, cultural, and systemic conditions, we must also reckon with the infrastructure of information as a relatively new and absolutely game-changing condition. The second aspect of the power of myth is focused precisely on power. That power, for the most part, is driven by information technology. The Marcoses have gained a firm foothold in YouTube, for instance, seeding it with visions and versions of its own alternative reality even before it became a massively popular platform. [The study conducted by the] scholars Miguel Paolo Reyes and Joel Fajardo Ariate Jr. of the University of the Philippines [on] the “Marcos truths,” tracing what they call a genealogy of historical distortions, helps explains how power meets myth.(Excerpts from “The Color of Malice,” remarks prepared for the Private Education Assistance Committee’s LIDER2 Series.)",0
10,John Nery,"Last Thursday, I had the great good fortune to speak at the Private Education Assistance Committee’s LIDER2 series; my topic was combating historical denialism. Allow me to share excerpts of my speech. This week, a discussion of what some historians call positive historical revisionism. Next week, the conditions that allow historical denialism to take root. Bear with me: In mis-translating Rizal’s (Tagalog translation of) Article 12 (of the 1789 “Declaration of the Right of Man and the Citizen”), did (Encarnacion) Alzona revise history? In translating only the main clause in Article 12, and in adding a new thought to it, did Rizal engage in an act of historical revisionism? In pointing out Alzona’s translation error, are we acting like revisionists?

If by the term we mean negative historical revisionism, then the short answer to all three questions is No. If by the term we mean positive revisionism, then the answer is Yes. The distinction is important. From my perspective, positive historical revisionism involves three different types of change.

First is the correction. Whenever the historical record is reviewed, whether the review is prompted by new scholarship or plain serendipity, errors will inevitably surface or become visible. Correcting the errors, such as changing Alzona’s English translation of Rizal’s Article 12 to reflect its true meaning, is a positive revision. It brings the historical record closer to the truth as we know it.

Second is the contextualization. History is not only detail, but background; not only facts, but context. Providing or updating the context brings the historical record closer to the truth as we know it, and is a positive revision. To cite a small instance, the 1976 edition of Rizal’s “Political and Historical Writings” does not name the translator; the 2007 edition does — and the addition of Alzona’s name is a modest but called-for change in (the publication’s) context.

Third is the construction, by which I mean interpretation. History is not necessarily written by the victors, as scholars like William Henry Scott have taught us. But history is necessarily told from specific perspectives. New research or new thinking may improve a previous interpretation, or widen the perspective from which it is written. In that way, reconstruing the historical record brings it closer to the truth as we know it.
AFP vows to help secure Edsa anniversary rites
In my “Revolutionary Spirit: Jose Rizal in Southeast Asia,” I suggested a framework with which to understand the most common types of error in Rizal studies. Perhaps we can apply that framework here.

Let me start with the unfortunate error, the type that “concerns merely factual imprecision.” Alzona’s mistake in translating Article 12 as being about the formation of public opinion (rather than being about the creation of an armed force) falls under this category. Fixing this mistake only requires the first kind of positive revision: a correction of the factual error. The instructive error may “throw unexpected light” on some aspect under study. Alzona’s error leads us to read Rizal’s Tagalog translation again; but I think it is genuinely puzzling that Rizal translated only half of Article 12. This puzzle is new to me, I do not have any answers, but I think it is important to note the possibility that Rizal’s erasure of the second half of Article 12 can lead to new understanding. Fixing this mistake requires the second kind of positive revision: a contextualization.

The pernicious error is “a gross misinterpretation.” I was referring to the fundamentally flawed premises from which Rizal’s biographers proceeded: Austin Craig, for example, believed Rizal was a proto-American; Miguel de Unamuno thought Rizal was an impractical dreamer. At a very basic level, they misunderstood Rizal. Fixing a mistake like this requires the third and most difficult kind of positive revision: construction, or reinterpretation. Correction, contextualization, construction: All these positive revisions become possible because of new research, new discoveries or breakthroughs, new or updated thinking. We call these changes positive historical revisionism because they are an exercise in getting closer to the truth.

The journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame uses a phrase which I have borrowed again and again, because it sums up what journalists pursue: the goal of journalism, he said, is to get “the best obtainable version of the truth.” I think historians have the same goal, but with more finely tuned tools, a more comprehensive view or review of related literature, deeper research, and longer timetables. Truth IS obtainable, but the word “obtain” suggests a humbling struggle, a grasping after, a perpetual chase. And the errors these positive revisions can fix have something basic in common: the absence of malice. When Alzona mistranslated Article 12, or when Rizal translated only the first half of it and added his own description, they did not do so to mislead the individual reader or the public at large. They made what we call honest mistakes.

There was no direct intent to deceive.",0
11,John Nery,"As it turns out, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno isn’t really with the opposition. The premise of the Sambayan convenor process was the search for a unifying presidential candidate who would oppose Dutertismo and its awful, consequential changes. My own summary of these changes include the so-called war on drugs, which has led to thousands of extrajudicial killings; the pivot to China, which has created an unpatriotic presidency subservient to Beijing; and the continuing rehabilitation of the Marcoses. To those opposed to the Duterte regime, the evidence for these changes is already established, the fact-finding already painstakingly done. After all, the Duterte presidency is already past its fifth year.

To hear Moreno speak after he announced his presidential candidacy, however, the existence of these changes, and especially their consequences, remain matters to be investigated. That betrays his political colors: If he were truly in the opposition, he would welcome the decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Court to formally investigate President Duterte for crimes against humanity. If he were truly in the opposition, he would criticize the President’s subcontracting his foreign policy to Beijing, and would not offer such a non-patriot a seat in his Cabinet. And if he were truly in the opposition, he would not pretend that his friends, the Marcoses, were somehow the victims who have been prevented all these years from adequately explaining their “side.”

Why did the Sambayan convenors include Moreno, whose real last name is Domagoso, in their list of candidates? I can hazard a couple of guesses: First, the mayor’s increasingly pointed criticism of the national government’s pandemic response made him a sympathetic figure. It didn’t hurt his image when he started criticizing the attempts to crown the President’s daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, as the heir apparent. Second, the convenors, or at least some of them, wanted the popular, charismatic ex-actor to BE opposition. In that sense, they were only reflecting the opinion of many.

But if anyone in the real opposition is still unclear about Moreno’s political positioning, just consider his view on the incarceration of Sen. Leila de Lima. He accepts the ostensibly objective view that the matter is now completely with the courts; if he were truly with the opposition, he would know, first, that her cases were politically motivated and that, second, he should rush to repair the injustice. Instead, we get pabulum:

“If … Senator Leila de Lima can avail such right, she should be given that kind of right.”
In talks I’ve given before different audiences, including diplomats, I classified three types of prospective presidential candidates for 2022: continuity candidates like Sara, change candidates like Vice President Leni Robredo, and career candidates like Sen. Manny Pacquiao. No real need to define the first two, but the third one requires an explanation. There are candidates like Pacquiao and former senator Bongbong Marcos who will regard 2022 as their best chance to become president; in other words, 2022 is a career opportunity.

As his last fight proved, Pacquiao is nearing the end of his illustrious career as a boxer. There can’t be too many big-ticket fights left. A clearheaded review of his lackluster, almost non-existent political career should lead to an inevitable conclusion: His chances of rising to higher office are dependent on his continuing boxing fame. Given that, and given that his money is still (largely) intact, it would make sense for him to run for president in 2022.

If Marcos runs for president next year, he would likely have the support of an incumbent president; if that support is total, it may be good for two or so million votes. He would be 65 next year, his father died at 72; the difference is about the length of a presidential term. Not the least of his considerations: Next year is the 50th anniversary of the declaration of martial law. What better way to seal his family’s rehabilitation than to be the commander in chief who presides over that anniversary? (For these reasons, I think Marcos will in fact run for president.)

In my classification scheme, I placed Moreno in all three categories. Some in the opposition believed that he was genuinely with the opposition; I do not know what they would say now, in light of Moreno’s (disastrous) pronouncements after the (impressive) rollout of his candidacy. But at least until last week, earnest arguments for including Moreno in the opposition could still be made.
I also argued that, at least until around July this year, Moreno was still among those favored by President Duterte, enough to be considered as a possible continuity candidate. Until July, the President had always expressed admiration for the mayor, at least since he slayed the political giant Erap Estrada in 2019. It was only after Moreno criticized Sara’s attempted coronation that the President started criticizing him in turn.

But Isko Moreno is also a “career” candidate. Having known both the thrill of celebrity as an actor and the pain of loss as a senatorial candidate (in 2016), and then scaled the heights of popularity as the go-getting mayor of Manila, Moreno, in my view, understands just how fickle political goodwill can be. If he defers running, there is no assurance that he will remain popular in 2028. Now is the time.

Precisely because he is running for the career opportunity that the presidency represents, he has been trying to appeal to all; it is remarkable how, since last week, he has refrained from using the tough language the current crisis needs. (Has he even been heard from on the Pharmally scandal?). But in extending the length of the fence he is sitting on, more people can see him for who he is: a fence sitter",0
12,John Nery,"Even after the assassination of opposition leader Ninoy Aquino, and especially his funeral procession, shattered the last remaining pretensions of the Marcos regime to genuine popular support, the anti-Marcos opposition wasn’t united. The focus on fighting the dictator’s regime was common to all—but that fight was not understood, or fought, on the same terms.

In May 1984, for instance, less than a year after the Aquino assassination, opposition forces were split on the issue of the first regular elections for the Batasan Pambansa, the parliamentary centerpiece of Marcos’ new constitutional order. Should the opposition field candidates even though the odds were long and the voting process was likely rigged? Cory Aquino campaigned on a pragmatic note: participation without illusion, she said. Some other opposition leaders, including one of the most formidable of them all, the “old man” Lorenzo Tañada, called for a boycott of the legislative elections. Among those who joined his campaign: Ninoy and Cory’s only son, Noynoy.

Even when the unexpected victory of opposition assemblymen, like Hilario Davide Jr. of Pusyon Bisaya of Cebu and Homobono Adaza of the Mindanao Alliance, resulted in the minority expanding its ranks to about a third of the Batasan, giving it a measure of legislative leverage for the first time, not everyone opposed to Marcos saw the electoral struggle as an effective means, or even a valid strategy, to fight the regime. In the 1986 Snap Election, when Marcos himself was on the ballot, National Democratic forces continued to boycott the electoral process—a fateful decision that led to consequential rethinking within the movement in the aftermath of Marcos’ ouster.

But even Cory’s place at the head of the opposition, as its standard bearer, was not assured. Doy Laurel was the leader of the traditional political opposition in the Philippines; he welcomed Ninoy back to the Philippines and, a few days later, Cory too, in his capacity as the opposition leader who stayed home. When Marcos announced that by the powers vested in him by his own constitution, he was calling an unscheduled election, Laurel believed that he had the legitimacy to contest the presidency on behalf of all the opposition.

In hindsight, his commitment to what was called the freedom struggle was genuine, his capacity to do the hard work of campaigning against an ailing dictator unquestionable. But to many of us filling the aisles and corridors of the so-called parliament of the streets, Laurel was marked by the fatal sign of compromise. He retained the sprawling and strategic province of Batangas as his political base even in the depths of military rule; surely, or so we thought, this could only have been by arrangement? We knew Marcos remained loyal to the memory of Laurel’s father, who was the Supreme Court justice who caused the young Marcos’ cinematic acquittal on a murder charge. That was (always) true, but that the province of Batangas was neglected during the Marcos years, precisely as punishment for Doy Laurel’s political preeminence, was also true.

It had to take Jaime Cardinal Sin, the archbishop of Manila, to convince Laurel in December 1985 to cede what he must have perceived as his responsibility to run for the presidency, to the widow of the man whose killing had eventually forced Marcos to reclaim a public mandate.

Even before the defection of Juan Ponce Enrile and Fidel Ramos, the opposition forces which eventually coalesced around Cory Aquino when she ran against Marcos in the snap election was already a Big Tent: It included the leaders Ninoy himself looked up to, such as Jose Diokno and Jovito Salonga, and representatives of new or reemerging forces Ninoy did not know about. It included human rights lawyers like Joker Arroyo and Rene Saguisag, and anti-Marcos firebrands like Nene Pimentel and Bobbit Sanchez, who advised Cory—but it also included the most influential members of the business community, personified in the charismatic and influential Jimmy Ongpin.

After Cory became president, the fault lines in the opposition triggered increasingly public movements and shocks. But on Feb. 7, 1986, the Marcosian date Marcos himself chose as the day of decision, many of the opposition forces learned to focus on the do-or-die election, and rallied around one standard. By stepping forward, Cory not only made the difference; she made the difference possible.

13,John Nery,"We need to be smart about surveys. I’ve heard people who work in marketing say they don’t believe in surveys because in all their life they’ve never been part of a survey’s random sample. This is basic innumeracy (how many possible sets of 1,800 respondents are there in a population of 110 million?) compounded by demographic ignorance (a marketing executive likely belongs to a sliver of the AB “class,” a random sample of which must be proportional to the actual size of that demographic class).

To be clear: Surveys are not determinative — at least until the second survey round of the 90-day campaign period. That means that it will be the survey cycle about four or five weeks into the national campaign period where we may find public opinion consolidating.

The 2016 elections are instructive: In September 2015, Grace Poe led with 26 percent, in November Rody Duterte with 38, in December Poe and Jojo Binay tied with 26 (with Duterte dropping dramatically to 20 percent because of his cursing of the most popular person in Philippine survey history, Pope Francis). In January 2016, Binay led with 31 percent, in February (just before the campaign period started), Binay remained at the lead with 29 percent, in early March, Poe regained the lead with 27, and then in late March (over a month into the campaign), Duterte was back at the top with 27 percent. He remained the Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey leader until Election Day.

While the trend lines in the 2010 campaign are somewhat different, because Noynoy Aquino was the beneficiary of a genuinely popular draft with his mother’s death in August 2009, his high numbers (much higher than everyone else’s) went steadily down until the campaign period started in earnest. The first survey conducted during the campaign showed Manny Villar only a few points away; but with the second survey, conducted in mid-March, Aquino began pulling away again from Villar, Joseph Estrada, and the others, this time for good.

I share the view that SWS and Pulse Asia are by and large accurate; it is political folly to ignore them. We should treat these two survey groups with proven track records the way President Arroyo treated them in her 2004 election: with great discipline, using their surveys to guide her campaign. (It wasn’t until she was fighting a legitimacy crisis in the wake of the “Hello, Garci” scandal that her otherwise professional officials started badmouthing surveys.)

For supporters of Manny Pacquiao, this means tracking his ability to drain votes from Sara Duterte among Mindanao’s 15 million or so voters (as of 2019). For Isko Moreno, it means keeping his Luzon base solid while increasing his support in the Visayas. For Leni Robredo, this means consolidating support in the Bicol region and in Western and possibly Central Visayas, while nursing a slow but steady growth in national numbers (the next threshold is 10 percent) with every survey.

Consider the dzRH survey, conducted in the last week of July. From the looks of it, this was a true scientific survey, with a professional polling organization doing the fieldwork. It reinforces the narrative of inevitability that the Duterte dynasty wants to tell the world: Some 25 percent of the voting population (one out of every four voters) will vote for Sara as president, while 15 percent (roughly one out of every six or seven voters) will support her father if he runs for the vice presidency.

The dzRH survey does not have the same track record as SWS or Pulse Asia, but if it is truly aboveboard, meeting the rigorous requirements of a real survey, then we can study it the way we study the June 2021 Pulse Asia survey — which has the same top line.
Mindful of the difference in actual polling methods used, we cannot directly compare and contrast the dzRH survey of July with the Pulse Asia poll of June. And yet it is still also instructive to read the surveys as snapshots in a series of snapshots taken of the voting landscape. Then it is possible to discern not only current positions, but also possible movements.

At this point, both types of presidential mandates still seem possible: the 20-percent presidency, which we elected in 1992, or the 40-percent presidency, which we elected in all presidential votes since then. It would be helpful for supporters of the different presidential candidates to work on the assumption that 2022 is headed for yet another election winner with about 40 percent of the vote — while keeping in mind that a close race would make even a 20-percent mandate possible.",0
14,John Nery,"If memory serves me right, Vicente “Ting” Paterno ran for the Senate in 1987 on a simple campaign theme. While his track record was clear and clean, it was also complicated; he had served as a minister in Ferdinand Marcos’ presidential-parliamentary Cabinet, before becoming an independent assemblyman, then Metro Manila chair of the National Citizens’ Movement for Free Elections, then one of “Cory’s Candidates” for the Senate.
His campaign poster cut, or melted, that Gordian knot of complication with a warm but also accurate slogan: “Ting Paterno. Mabuting tao.”

As I have argued before, Cory Aquino had the longest coattails in Philippine history; in that first election for the Senate since the fall of the Marcos regime, 22 of her 24 candidates won. Paterno was one of the non-politicians who rode those same coattails; like them, he also had an impressive personal reputation, backed by a sterling curriculum vitae, that recommended him to the voter. In 1987, the only time he ran for national office, 9.6 million voters cast their ballot for him.

I am reminded of this virtually forgotten moment in history because it might have something to say to us today. Ten months before the first vote is cast, I’ll step out on a limb (again), and suggest that the 2022 elections will be about change. If correct, this is good for the political opposition — even though they will share this message with other politicians and political parties. Those allied with President Duterte since the start, such as Senate President Tito Sotto and Sen. Ping Lacson, have consolidated their strategy to put some legitimate distance between themselves and the President. The President himself has inexplicably decided to go to war against the one politician who can divide the President’s own Mindanao base; if Sen. Manny Pacquiao decides to run for the presidency, he will not position himself as opposition (he will not attack the President directly); rather, he will self-identify as someone more deeply committed to the President’s own program—which, seen through the surrealist prism of Philippine politics, effectively turns him into a change candidate.

How will the opposition position itself? It’s becoming clearer by the week that the only real and viable option for the political opposition is Vice President Leni Robredo running for president. All other options carry the serious risk of triggering disunity and a free-for-all.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
Part of Robredo’s appeal is that she is an excellent executive. Despite having one of the smallest budgets of any government agency, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) has (to borrow another boxing metaphor) punched well above its weight. The OVP’s performance during the pandemic has been nothing short of extraordinary; the budget hearings last year allowed lawmakers to put their praise on the record. She appeals to those who want the opposite of the incumbent.

The untimely death of former president Noynoy Aquino has only sharpened the contrast between the current administration and what some people have called, for lack of a better term, “disente” governance. The problem with the term, and the attitude that gives rise to the term, is that it can be condescending, unconsciously paternalistic, even sometimes elitist. It grates.
But the phrase “mabuting tao” (a good person) doesn’t seem to carry all that extra baggage. To be sure, I am Bisaya, but growing up in Metro Manila in the ‘70s and ‘80s, “mabuting tao” seemed to me to be a genuine compliment, the more effective (and affecting) because it wasn’t reaching for superlatives. I had the chance to meet Senator Paterno a number of times, and he truly was “mabuting tao” — in exactly the same way that fisherman Ka Virgilio Santos of Hagonoy, Bulacan, who hosted me in 1985, was; in the same way that Myrna Aboniawan, now Siose, of Cagayan de Oro, who works with Archbishop Emeritus Antonio Ledesma, is; in the same way that Doc Leslie Manalo Medina of Holy Angel University, or Elin Guro of Mindanao State University in Marawi, are. The list is endless — and that’s the hopeful thing.

However, I understand “mabuting tao” also in the late interior secretary Jesse Robredo’s terms; that is to say, not only good but also competent. In his phrasing: “matino at mahusay.”
It is precisely for this reason that Sen. Kiko Pangilinan’s decisive action to sue YouTube channels “Starlet” and “Latest Chika,” as well as Google Philippines’ country manager Bernadette Nacario, for highly defamatory and completely fabricated videos against him and his wife, the megastar actress Sharon Cuneta, inspires me. To reclaim the life that is worthy of the best of us, we must not only be good people; we must also be smart, daring, effective.
This was a risky action, because it invites even more trolling against the opposition senator and because Google, which owns YouTube, has immense resources. It is literally a trillion-dollar company. But the move is welcome. It puts the onus on Google and YouTube to clean up their act, and it sprays those fetid channels with the disinfectant of daylight.",0
15,John Nery,"The rejection a year ago of the franchise renewal application of the ABS-CBN network by the House of Representatives committee on legislative franchises was a political decision; it should have political consequences.

It was political in the barest, most basic sense: It was a display of power, made against the evidence provided by the very government agencies invited by the committee, against clear public opinion in favor of the network. At the end of the lengthy process, involving 12 hearings altogether, one of the three leaders of the anti-ABS-CBN inquisition, Rep. Rodante Marcoleta, summed up the entire proceeding with an unforgettable phrase. Notwithstanding the favorable testimony of the representatives of the various government agencies called to Congress, and the testimony of the network’s own representatives, Marcoleta said, “it is the will of Congress that must be accorded respect.”

“Killing” the application then (to use another unforgettable quote, this time from Rep. Mike Defensor) was an act of political will, the will of Congress. The 70 congressmen who voted at the committee level to reject a new franchise for the ABS-CBN network wanted it, and willed it to happen.

But fearing the consequences of an obviously unpopular decision, the House of Representatives then under the leadership of Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, and now under the leadership of Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, has declined to release the official list of those who voted against the network. Typical conduct in these times: the privileges and perks of power, without the responsibilities. But an unofficial list exists, and lawmakers and House insiders alike attest to its accuracy. The accuracy is important, because the voters who were offended by the naked power play of Congress, caused by President Duterte’s own and often repeated threats to shut down ABS-CBN, should be able to exact accountability at the ballot box.

But taking offense is not enough; the pushback against the 70 perpetrators of what I and others have called “legislative murder” should not be left to chance. There is an ongoing signature campaign to justify a people’s initiative to enact a law granting the ABS-CBN network a new franchise; there are some two million Bayan patrollers—the citizen journalists trained by the network over the years; there are many millions of new subscribers to the different ABS-CBN channels online. These and other supporters of the network can be harnessed to make the politicians who voted unfairly on the franchise issue face political consequences.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
The campaign can take the following forms:

First, as platform. All candidates for the House, the Senate, and the presidency should be asked if they commit to a new franchise for the ABS-CBN network at the soonest possible time, in the 19th Congress. This will not only put every candidate on the record; it may well create a momentum for a new franchise.

I realize a campaign pledge can degenerate into a form of costless signaling, more cheap talk. That is a feature, not a bug, of electoral politics. But seeking the reversal of an unjust policy, taking up a popular cause, strengthening press freedom: These are important democratic initiatives in themselves, and if the renewal of the ABS-CBN franchise as a campaign platform generates a groundswell of support in the political class, or creates a sense of inevitability in the political calendar, then we should count that as a real gain.

Second, as retribution. Holding politicians to account for their acts of omission or commission is the very nature of the democratic project. That old saying, about elections presenting voters the opportunity to “throw the rascals out,” is not a threat; it is the promise of every election.
At the same time, not all 70 lawmakers who voted against ABS-CBN are equally vulnerable. To make the promise of democratic elections work to its advantage, the public must organize itself, and then determine who among the 70 or their chosen successor-rascals can be successfully thrown out.

Let the political consequences fall where they may — but before the public aggrieved by the rejection of the ABS-CBN franchise can get even, it must get organized.",0
16,John Nery,"Some 10 days after the unexpected death of ex-president Noynoy Aquino, and about 10 months before the 2022 national elections, it might be good to ask: What is the state of the opposition?
Colleague Manolo Quezon has responded to my previous analyses of the prospects of the political opposition with a sweeping conclusion: Everyone becomes opposition anyway, the closer the next elections get. If true, this makes “opposition” as an analytical concept porous, ambiguous to the point of irrelevance.

But history shows us that this in fact isn’t true. In 2016, both the Roxas and Poe campaigns promised continuity with the reformist agenda of the second Aquino administration, and even candidate Rodrigo Duterte, who did campaign on a platform of change, used the three Comelec-sponsored presidential debates to also promote a corollary message: that he would have no problems implementing other campaign platforms, including that of administration candidate Roxas, as long as they work.

The 1992 and 1998 elections featured more than one viable candidate campaigning for continuity: Ramos, Mitra, even arguably Salonga in 1992; and De Venecia, Lim, Roco in 1998. It’s possible that the two elections which served as a referendum on President Gloria Arroyo may be the rare events with only one continuity candidate each: Arroyo herself in 2004, Teodoro in 2010. (The last reading, however, depends on whether Manny Villar would be classified as a candidate for continuity — remember “Villarroyo”? — or change.) So even on the simplified basis of continuity or change, “opposition” remains a very real thing. Are there prospective candidates in 2022 who represent change, and thus should be classified as opposition? Of course.

Is the popular boxer Manny Pacquiao opposition then? Of course not. He may be in for the political fight of his life, but it is a fight being fought squarely within the ropes President Duterte himself set. Despite all his talk about corruption in the government (which, needless to say, the opposition should encourage), Pacquiao continues to represent continuity with the Duterte agenda: hard line on crime, partiality to favored businesses, use of the national security mantle.

After Pacquiao last week, former senator Sonny Trillanes launched a new exposé against Sen. Bong Go (and by implication, President Duterte) this week. Is Trillanes opposition? Of course. He campaigned against Mr. Duterte’s candidacy, he criticized the new administration even before it took office, he has repeatedly resisted many administration attempts to put him back in detention. His new exposé is also much more detailed than Pacquiao’s, and forms part of a year-long pattern that includes filing a case at the International Criminal Court. Even more important, he represents change; he has been unreservedly loyal to Vice President Leni Robredo, and remains committed to stopping the democratic erosion of the last five years.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
To say there is no difference between Pacquiao and Trillanes, that “opposition” covers them equally well, is to misunderstand the situation.

That situation has changed dramatically in the last week and a half. Permission to be proud. Aquino’s untimely death on June 24 has given many Filipinos, not only those who happily worked for him, the opportunity to take pride in both the achievements of the Aquino administration and its strong work ethic. I would characterize this as a rediscovery, because for the first five years of his term, and then at the end of it, Aquino was more popular than previous presidents. The contrast is there to be made; while like others I appreciate the stories about Aquino’s habitual kindness, I do not think this is where the real story lies—because for many people President Duterte is also courteous and compassionate in person. The real difference is in their approach to governance, which explains the different results.

Reason for grievance, rumblings of disunity. Aquino’s death has also driven an old wedge back into the left/center coalition which, for now, represents the political opposition. Memories of how the National Democratic left demonized Aquino, contrasted with their early embrace of President Duterte, has slowed the already sluggish drive for opposition unity. The irrepressible Lourd de Veyra gave a sharp edge to the issue, when he appropriated the insult the left used to caricature Aquino, “Noynoying,” and redefined it to mean something altogether positive, honorable, extraordinary.

Search for the true legacy-bearer. The explosion of goodwill and the rediscovery of the abiding good that the Aquino political tradition has done immediately prompted a search for the right person to carry on Noynoy Aquino’s legacy. Dean Mel Sta. Maria started an online ruckus when he urged Aquino’s celebrity sister Kris to run for office (you can read my thoughts on that in “Thanks, Kris, but are you sure you want it?,” which I wrote way back in 2009). But there is a worthy Aquino to pass the baton to: ex-senator Bam Aquino. And there is a worthy candidate for president to carry the torch: Robredo.

But there have been other disturbances in the force. Let me discuss them online, at johnnery.wordpress.com.",0
17,John Nery,"It is not true that the second President Aquino never got his due. Before President Duterte reached new records in satisfaction or approval ratings, Noynoy Aquino was the most popular president since regular surveys began. In fact, and I would think very few of us would remember this, his high ratings remained high in the immediate aftermath of the “Yolanda” catastrophe.
In “Analysts before surveys: Aquino post-‘Yolanda’ edition” (1/7/2014), I gently criticized the Reuters news agency for basic innumeracy. A Reuters analysis that ran on Nov. 15, 2013, a week after Yolanda, pushed a narrative of “backlash” against the President for the initial handling of the disaster by basing it on a fundamental error. Reuters alleged that Aquino’s satisfaction ratings had plunged from 74 percent to 49 percent in September (crucially, several weeks BEFORE the supertyphoon made landfall). In fact, the first figure (from March 2013) was raw satisfaction (or number of satisfied), while the second figure was net satisfaction (that is, number of satisfied minus number of dissatisfied). The raw satisfaction rating for September 2013 was actually 68 percent—still down from 74, but not by as much. In other words, Reuters compared the raw apple with the net orange.

What explains this basic mistake? The analysis carried a sensational but unsupported headline: “Analysis: From hero to zero: Philippine president feels typhoon backlash.” Aside from the erroneous comparison between two surveys, the analysis included pessimistic comments from political commentators and this narrative-driven conclusion: “Political analysts say Aquino’s ratings will likely suffer in the next opinion polls, especially in the typhoon-swept central Philippine provinces that have been bastions of support.” (As I noted in my column, I shared that rapidly formed conventional wisdom, too.)

It was certainly conventional, but it wasn’t wise. In fact, it was the exact opposite; it was folly.
“From 68 percent in September, the President’s satisfaction rating [in December 2013] held statistically steady at 69 percent; his net satisfaction rating remained at plus 49 percent. In the Visayas, the hardest-hit disaster areas, his satisfaction rating rose from 68 to 70 percent … and his net satisfaction remained statistically steady, up from plus-48 to plus-50.”

I did not fully understand it then, but I can see now, from what the Reuters example shows, that Yolanda may have marked the point where the media narrative about the second Aquino presidency diverged from public opinion. A raw satisfaction rating of 69 percent in the immediate aftermath of the most powerful storm ever recorded is something to marvel at. And yet, while a still patient people continued to give President Aquino his due, the media had found a new narrative to push. From hero to zero, indeed.

It was only after the Mamapasano incident that public opinion caught up with the media narrative. In March 2015, Aquino received his lowest ratings: 47 percent raw satisfaction, 11 percent net. The high death toll and the internal politics of the raid finally snapped the people’s patience. Aquino’s decision not to receive the caskets of the (42 of 44) slain SAF officers flown back to Manila may well have been the pivotal moment. As I have argued in many columns, for instance in “What is Aquino accountable for?” (2/3/2015), his decision-making was partly at fault. And yet, even today, after his death, many in the mainstream media have continued to internalize the negative narrative about Aquino in the last half of his term. In the Philippine Star’s first story on his passing, for instance, the SAF raid was described as a “failed” operation—when in fact the main objective was met: the capture or death of the terrorist Marwan. The cost of success was steep, but as controversial and fault-ridden as it was, the raid succeeded.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
When people say, then, that President Aquino did not get his due, my own reflection on my own practice and that of my profession leads me to two related conclusions: First, they mean, even without directly accusing the mainstream media, that the media narratives about Aquino during his presidency had failed to reflect the full scope and true scale of his achievements. And second, they mean that the new gatekeepers of reputation, even without directly referring to the architects and influencers and grassroots operators of what the scholars Jonathan Corpus Ong and Jason Cabañes call an “invisible machine” of networked disinformation, have built their own negative narratives about Aquino, and these have obscured the nature and character of his presidency.

Once, the Inquirer hosted a group of Asian journalists; it was my task to announce President Aquino’s arrival. Palace staff told me, repeatedly, that protocol required me to say “the President of the Philippines,” not the more familiar, more usual, “President of the Republic of the Philippines.” When Aquino arrived at the Inquirer’s multi-purpose hall, I dutifully announced: “Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Philippines.”

But it was Press Secretary Sonny Coloma’s role to introduce Aquino before he read his speech, and when he did, he introduced him, simply, and to my everlasting amusement, in the exact way I was told not to: “Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Republic of the Philippines!”
I remember this anecdote now, because the outpouring of praise for his character and his presidency, the belated settling and resolving of media accounts, reminded me that, while he was a reluctant president, he was also a good one. He deserves to be introduced, for all time, according to the phrasing we find in the Constitution he defended and consulted every single day: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Philippines.",0
18,John Nery,"With the political class now focused on next year’s elections, it is even more important for us as voters and as citizens to distinguish signal from noise. We are hearing a lot from allies of President Duterte and other members of his governing coalition; the President himself has been talking up (or talking down—same difference) about the possibility of running for vice president. The different factions are busy maneuvering for position. Much of what we hear is noise, but I think the following signals are clearly being sent: Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte, Manila City Mayor Isko Moreno, and Sen. Manny Pacquiao are running for president. While long considering a run for the presidency himself, former senator Bongbong Marcos is now open to running for vice president again. Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano is thinking of higher office again, but he will run for the Senate, where like Marcos he will be a shoo-in. House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez is a strong contender for speaker, if he runs for a fifth term as congressman, but the appeal of national office, whether senator or vice president, is strong. Part of the appeal is the support of two presidents: Mr. Duterte and Gloria Arroyo. Also, Romualdez coming close to winning a Senate seat in 2016, with over 12 million votes, is signal, not noise.

We are hearing much from the ranks of the opposition, and from those who have begun to distance themselves from the Duterte administration. I’m afraid the launch of the 1Sambayan selection process the other week generated more noise, but the following signals came through loud and clear: The left has embraced the 1Sambayan process more than the center; the excitement over Batangas Rep. Vilma Santos running for national office is genuine; the Sambayan process aside, only Vice President Leni Robredo seems capable of winning unified support.

But as frustrated Robredo supporters know only too well, the Vice President is not yet ready to decide. There was one other signal I heard in the aftermath of the 1Sambayan launch; to be completely candid, I’ve written on this exact point before, so it is possible that I heard it because I wanted to hear it. But bear with me: Robredo has the power to convene a genuinely unified Senate slate.

We heard Sen. Ping Lacson say nice-enough things about Robredo, but as far as his own plans are concerned, he says, now, that it is either the presidency or bust. We heard reelectionist Sen. Joel Villanueva downplay his father’s inclusion in the 1Sambayan short list, because of recent family tragedies; we also heard that Sen. Nancy Binay, who was reelected to the Senate in 2019, asked that her name be removed from consideration. But the reality is, 1Sambayan IS talking to Bro. Eddie Villanueva and former vice president Jojo Binay. All of those who were named as part of the short list of presidential and vice presidential candidates were in discussions with Sambayan. And some progress seems to have been reached in the search for campaign donations. Above all, we heard Robredo say this, in Filipino, on her Sunday radio program the day after the 1Sambayan launch: “We need to understand why many are attracted to the President, why many are attracted to these politicians.” Also: “We cannot say … that we are the only good ones.” Not least: “That because others believe differently, then they are bad—that cannot be.”

New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
This is the altogether credible language of unity; the opposition needs to bring different forces together. In its Senate slate, it must make room for those who have consistently opposed the Duterte coalition, and for those it can make common cause with: Lacson, the younger Villanueva, the older Binay, Santos and her husband Ralph Recto, and so on. In this sense, Robredo has the power to convene a true unified slate; given the opposition’s straitened circumstances, power is also duty.

I see that my colleague Manolo Quezon has, in his otherwise instructive newsletter marking Jose Rizal’s 160th birthday, again recommended the great Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno as a reference on, and for, the national hero. It is true that, especially in the 1960s, Unanumo’s reflections on Rizal commanded the attention of the country’s leading intellectuals. But as I wrote in “One who got it all wrong” (10/19/2010), Unamuno got it all wrong. I developed the argument in my “Revolutionary Spirit,” but the gist of it is that the philosopher who broke the (rather simple) code Rizal used in his diaries misunderstood Rizal completely. He thought Rizal was “an impenitent dreamer,” he called him “a weak and irresolute man for action and life,” he described the martyr as “a Quijote of thought, who looked with repugnance upon the impurities of reality.” In fact, Rizal was a man of many projects, who got his hands (literally) dirty, who made difficult decisions and took courageous action time and again. The worst of Unamuno’s reflections is that he accepted (and to use a current term, amplified) the view that Rizal saw himself as undone by presumption. This is the Spanish colonial view: Poor Rizal was only a Filipino, who overreached and was ruined in Spain and other foreign countries. Like I said, Unamuno got Rizal all wrong.",0
19,John Nery,"The issue of the true location of the first Mass celebrated in the Philippines is an old one. Is it Butuan, as a Spanish tradition held, or is it Limasawa, as historical research asserts? As part of the preparations to mark the 500th anniversary of Ferdinand Magellan’s arrival in the Philippines and Lapu-Lapu’s victory in the Battle of Mactan, the National Quincentennial Committee (NQC) convened a panel of experts to investigate the controversy, yet again. This wasn’t the first time that the Philippine government conducted an official expert inquiry into the issue.

The first one took place in 1980; the second one, called the Gancayco Committee after its chair, former Supreme Court justice Emilio Gancayco, convened in 1995; the third attempt, a committee headed by historian Benito Legarda Jr., met in 2008. All three found that the evidence supported Limasawa.

Just the same, in late 2018, the NQC formed the Mojares panel, named after its chair, National Artist for Literature Resil Mojares. The memorandum read: “Notwithstanding the possibilities that reopening this controversy may open old wounds or even create new ones, the [National Historical Commission of the Philippines] and the NQC want everyone to be somber, respectful, and professional. Moreover, all must follow the basic rule of doing historiographical studies, i.e., every assertion must be supported by credible, authentic, and verifiable primary sources. Second, everyone should be guided by the fact that no one has a monopoly on truth and all must be given equal opportunity to articulate his position on this issue. Lastly, we should be prepared to accept the possibility that the NQC may not be able to settle this issue conclusively because of the unavailability and ambiguity of the sources.” And yet in fact the Mojares panel, which included eminent experts Dr. Danilo Gerona, Dr. Francis Navarro, Dr. Carlos Madrid Alvarez-Piñer, Fr. Antonio de Castro, SJ, and Dr. Jose Victor Torres, reached a robust conclusion.

After a calibrated process that took a year and included a focus group discussion “done solely for the Butuan proponents” in November 2018, three exhaustive meetings of the panel (in Cebu in December 2018, in Tacloban in April 2019, and in Manila in July 2019), and four site inspections, the Mojares panel concluded that, “based on the evidence presented and the research it has conducted in aid of the evaluation, the evidence and arguments presented by the pro-Butuan proponents, while commendably serious and substantial, are not sufficiently conclusive as to demand a repeal or reversal of the current government ruling on the case of the First Easter Sunday Mass. The panel therefore recommends that Limasawa Island, Leyte, be sustained as the site of the First Easter Sunday Mass of 1521.”
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
The well-written panel report is a compelling read; it can be downloaded as a PDF file from the NHCP website. It reached other conclusions, including a grace note for the Butuan tradition: “The panel, however, recognizes the deep historical significance of the greater Butuan area as a precolonial trading center and base in the Christianization of Mindanao, a significance that transcends the question of whether or not it is the site of the ‘first mass.’ The panel therefore recommends that the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) initiate and support the promotion of Butuan as a one of the country’s premier historic sites.” But one of the Butuan proponents, Dr. Potenciano R. Malvar, rejected the findings of the fourth government inquiry. And in March 2021, just before the new wave of COVID-19 cases struck, he filed suit.

Alleging libel and the crime of falsification, he accused the members of the Mojares panel, as well as an expert who served in an advisory capacity, of having “maliciously concluded, without any explanation and basis that my presentation or position paper was based on conjectures and fictional account.”

What exactly did the Mojares panel report say about Malvar’s presentation?

“The evidence presented by Malvar in his paper that Pigafetta’s latitude measurement of 9°3/4’ was part of a plan to conceal the actual location of the First Easter Sunday Mass to protect the route to the Moluccas is based on conjectures from ideas derived from secondary sources including a fictional account of the Magellan Expedition.

“The panel contends that if there was such a plan or intent to conceal the route of the expedition, the part of the route that should have been hidden would be the coordinates to the passage through the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America and not that of the Philippines. It was this passage to the West that was one of the primary objectives of the expedition as it was the way to get to the Spice Islands through a western route beyond Portuguese territory. 

“Malvar’s thesis was, therefore, not accepted by the panel.”

To this carefully reasoned, evidence-based refutation of Malvar’s position, he responds in extraordinary fashion: by filing criminal complaints against the experts in the panel. This is dangerous nonsense; when Malvar joined the NHCP’s Call for Papers, he willingly accepted the parameters of a scholarly inquiry. Now that his claims have been judged—by a panel of experts—as unworthy of further consideration, he cannot run to the courts to enforce his own view. That would be to weaponize the law against historical truth.",0
20,John Nery,"Rolando Andaya Jr., a Camarines Sur representative for a total of 18 years and a budget secretary for four, is back in the news. Two weeks ago, it was for surviving an apparent assassination attempt. (The circumstances as initially reported drew a puzzling picture; the gunmen fired two shots, but Andaya said he didn’t realize what was happening and even went down from the vehicle to check on the disturbance.) And last week, it was for orchestrating ex-defense secretary and former presidential candidate Gilbert Teodoro’s return to the spotlight.
The stage was Davao City, specifically the office of Mayor Inday Sara Duterte, and the occasion was not the birthday of the President’s daughter and survey frontrunner (although it took place the week of her birthday) but rather the start of the theater season — election theater, that is. Andaya was both impresario and performer: He emceed Teodoro’s visit on social and traditional media, and played his role as enthusiastic supporter of what he called a “done deal”—the pairing of Sara and Teodoro as running mates in the 2022 elections—to the hilt.
It was, of course, no such thing. There was no done deal.

In the first place, Sara has not made a definitive announcement about her 2022 plans; it helps to have sycophantic supplicants like Andaya reinforce the inevitability of her presidential run, but it will simply not do for the announcement to be made through underlings. Secondly, and more important, it does not make logical or electoral sense for Sara, leading the pack of possible presidential candidates at 27 percent, to choose a sometime politician unheard from the last five years and polling at 0.5 percent in terms of vice presidential preferences as running mate. Aside from the funding she can get from Teodoro and his allies, including former president Gloria Arroyo—funds which she can raise elsewhere, from other allies—Teodoro at this point brings nothing to the table.

Thirdly, the language Andaya used to explain his “done deal” statement gave the game away. He called the younger Duterte and Teodoro “soulmates,” as though their political union were inevitable. But the actual statement immediately showed just how absurd, vapid, and manipulative it was: “Parang natural, parang soulmates na nagkita pero soulmates talaga.” The connection between the mayor and her visitor, Andaya said, was like natural, like they were soulmates who met, like true soulmates. Right.

This is not to say that Sara and Teodoro did not hit it off; they probably did. Teodoro’s visit must have gone as well as that of the Marcos siblings, who met the mayor two days before her birthday. (In terms of election theater, the visit by Sen. Imee Marcos and her brother Bongbong can be understood as a preview.)

Teodoro, who declined President Duterte’s offer to serve again as defense secretary in 2016, has been immersed in the private sector since he ran and lost in the 2010 presidential election. He was a capable defense secretary under President Arroyo, who earned the respect of both Washington, DC, and Beijing; but it is political fantasy to think that, 12 years after his last political appointment, he has what a presidential candidate needs in a running mate.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
Andaya’s entire objective in last week’s news cycle, then, was to simply raise Teodoro’s profile again, perhaps for a senatorial run. Was there in fact a done deal with Mayor Duterte? Listen to his spin, and one should immediately realize that it IS spin. Speaking mostly in Filipino, he explained that the done deal he was speaking of was something he imagined: “Sa isip ko ‘yun.” But unwilling yet to let go of a good narrative theme, he immediately added, again speaking mostly in Filipino: But now that I’m on my way out of city hall, in my view this is a done deal for the country, too. Then, back to reality: In only a short while, he said, this tandem won’t be just a dream anymore, but will be the tandem of the entire country.

In signaling theory, this is an example of cheap talk. Like promising to effect a reform in three to six months, the act of talking cheaply does not cost the speaker much. If the audience, whether adversary or ally, accepts the statement at face value, good for the speaker. If not, it doesn’t matter to the speaker either. It didn’t cost much.

Andaya’s stunt last week is cheap talk in this exact sense: His bluster about a done deal got lots of airtime and media space; it was designed to do so, and it was designed precisely in a way that would appeal to the media. It wasn’t cheap by the standards of the ordinary citizen, of course; after all, they flew on a private plane to Davao City. But it was cheap to Andaya and Teodoro and their political allies both financially and politically: They got the media to play along by sending a costless signal. If the media had ignored them, they would have shrugged their shoulders and gone on to the next stunt. 

A costly signal is one that requires a serious investment, in resources, preparation, money. The orchestrated campaign to support Sara Duterte’s presidential candidacy, by accumulating 17 million signatures, is an example. It sends a very clear message that Sara is in fact serious about running; unfortunately, the cost of that costly signal (public officials’ time, public resources’ use) is charged to the Filipino’s account.",0
21,Iris Gonzales,"Inside Bangladesh, it’s called the Gen Z revolution as young students from Dhaka University began protesting last month to demand an end to the government’s jobs quota system.

The system, according to a CNN report on the Bangladesh crisis, reserves 30 percent of civil service posts for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.

“Many of the country’s contemporary political elite are related to that generation – including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.”

Following days of protests which had turned bloody, the 76-year-old Prime Minister Hasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter to India.

Hasina’s sudden exit ends 15 years in power, which were marred by dissent because her government, according to critics and human rights organizations, stifled civil liberties.

Amid joblessness, high inflation in the post-pandemic era and the growing curtailment of freedom, protestors demanded change.

Ironically, Hasina led a democratic uprising against military rule in 1990. Now she has found herself in the same situation but at the other end of the uprising.

It was a long time coming. It was not a revolution that happened overnight.

Prior to the July 1 protest, critics and human rights organizations have already expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, harassment of the media and opposition figures, crackdown on freedom of expression online as well as arbitrary detention and torture in Bangladesh.

Tipping point
This was not the first time that protests hounded Hasina’s government even as she managed to survive previous demonstrations.

The recent protests, however, were different as police shot and killed the young dissidents in full view of their peers.

This seemed to be the tipping point. Protestors could no longer be stopped, not even by the threat of being killed by security forces.

“Driving the anger was high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it slowed in the post-pandemic era and is beset with high inflation and depleted foreign currency reserves. In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education,” according to CNN.

This could be the first major successful Gen Z revolution in world history, said Sabrina Karim, associate professor of government at Cornell University, who specializes in the study of political violence, as quoted by CNN.

People Power I
The Philippines is no stranger to uprisings.

In 1986, we inspired the world with the historic bloodless People Power revolt which toppled Ferdinand Marcos Sr.

Whether in the Philippines or in Bangladesh, however, the challenge is how to protect the freedoms we’ve fought for and successfully won.

The challenge is to fulfill that promise of change that protests and revolutions strived to usher in.

Leaders of change must make sure that they are indeed capable of becoming the change they want to see in their country; that they wouldn’t just turn into the next monster or ogre they successfully slayed and that they wouldn’t end up being corrupted by the system they vehemently opposed and tried to change.

Otherwise, it will just be a cycle of boom and bust; of authoritarian rule and revolutions; of protests and military rule or, in our case, of yellows and reds; of Marcos and Aquinos; or of Marcos and Dutertes.

Look what happened to us. We toppled a dictator and showed the world how it was done only to elect another Marcos into power more than three decades later.

Ironically, some of those who protested against then president Marcos Sr. back then are now part of the government of President Marcos Jr.

One cannot blame them, however. Or the masses. Perhaps for them, nothing really changed after the 1986 People Power Revolution.

We are unique in this sense because it seems we never really learn our lessons. History just keeps repeating itself, no matter how absurd a cycle that is.

One culprit I see here is corruption.

Corruption has been around for thousands of years. Shakespeare’s plays showed vignettes of corruption, while Dante supposedly placed bribers in the deepest parts of Hell, according to the International Monetary Fund’s working paper on corruption published in 1998.

And yet, it doesn’t seem to end.

After a new candidate or a new system is in place, the initial jubilation soon fades as constituents realize that the same old system or the same old trapo is back.

In the Philippines, it’s even getting worse, especially in local government units where corruption has become so deeply entrenched.

Pay offs or grease money have gone up by 30 to 50 percent, attest some businessmen; some local chieftains even offer “bespoke pay-offs packages” to entrepreneurs who want to set up shop in their locality, depending on their capacity to pay and their needs.

Local chieftains, like lawmakers, also have their own contractors which they require businessmen to hire.

Anti-corruption bodies, including the Anti-Red Tape Authority, must look into these reports to eradicate corruption in the different branches of our government.

Revolutions can only lead to lasting changes if they topple not just flawed leaders but corrupt systems as well.

This is a lesson that Gen Z Bangladeshis must also keep in mind now that they have removed their leader from power.

Otherwise, it’s just going to be the same old story.",0
22,Iris Gonzales,"Curtains close. Kisses stop. Love stories end.

Indeed, some things in life are fleeting and ephemeral. That’s just the way it is. There’s even an old adage that says all good things come to an end.

Once in a while, however, life surprises us with something so great that it lingers and lives on in our hearts. Forever.

Such is the music of the legendary rock band Eraserheads, the kind that resonated – and continues to resonate – with generations and generations of Filipinos. Their songs were always someone's anthem and gospel truth; inspiration or palliative; a curse even but always an impetus to move and act.

It’s no surprise therefore that on Tuesday, Aug. 20, members of the band – Marcus Adoro, Ely Buendia, Raimund Marasigan and Buddy Zabala – returned to their Alma Mater, the University of the Philippines, to receive the prestigious Gawad Oblation Award, the highest distinction that the university can bestow.

Says UP president Angelo Jimenez in his welcome remarks: “The Gawad Oblation is a symbol of our deep gratitude for that extraordinary service rendered with or in our name. In the name of UP.”

It’s no exaggeration, he adds, that the Eraserheads “are a pivotal force in the history of original Pilipino music.”

“The Eraserheads helped define the music, memories and identity of a generation, no less.”

They also humanized a generation during a very very divisive period in the history of our country by asserting individuality, president Jimenez also says.

For the band members who all studied in UP Diliman, it was a full circle moment of sorts. The university, they said, was the foundation for their voice, art and music.

In their acceptance speeches, the Eraserheads said it was in UP where they tasted and experienced real freedom. “Kalayaan pumili at maghayag, kalayaan sundin at kalayaan pakingan ang sariling himig,” said Marcus.

Raimund thanked his parents who supported him even if he didn’t get to bring home a diploma, drawing laughter from the crowd. Buddy, too, thanked those who supported the band throughout their journey.

Ely recalled how music saved him from a sure failing grade in Spanish. “Singko,” says the Eheads vocalist in an exaggerated Spanish accent, drawing more laughter from the crowd.

“I begged my professor for a passing grade. And he asked me: Do you have anything that would make me consider passing you? Anything at all?

Ely told his professor:

Well I can write a song and so I gave him a demo cassette of Pare ko and prayed.

The next day, to his pleasant surprise, his professor in Spanish told him that he passed.

This experience taught Ely two things.

“One is that my professor could understand Tagalog and that two, from that point on, that music can get me through anything in life.”

A year later in Kalayaan, Ely found three people who also had his struggles and shared his dream.

The rest, as they say, is history.

For the crowd that descended into the glittering Executive House for the Gawad Oblation awarding ceremony, it was a great honor and delight to bear witness to such a momentous occasion.

President Jimenez invited me to cover the event but there at that moment, I could barely cover. I was just taking it all in with wide-eyed awe and a full heart, listening, as a huge fan, to their story.

For how could I not? It was a band that accompanied my generation in the murky years of our lives – from teenage to adulthood, those years of first loves and first heartbreaks, first defeats and first triumphs.

But for the first time, I was not watching them perform. I was listening to their stories about their UP days.

What they said about UP being a bastion of freedom and an abode to find your voice and pursue your passion is perhaps true for every UP student and alumni.

Most Distinguished Alumnus
Days before, in a separate but equally festive awarding ceremony for the UP Alumni Association awardees, tycoon Isidro “Sid” Consunji shared a similar story as a student after he was hailed as this year’s Most Distinguished Alumnus of UP.

Sid described himself as an ordinary engineering student but highlighted the fact that he also learned a lot from the time he spent in UP – outside its classrooms.

“I spent more time outside the classroom than inside, being active in Beta Epsilon Fraternity and the Association of Civil Engineering Students,” said the DMCI Holdings chairman who led this year’s roster of distinguished awardees.

I, too, was at the UPAA event, together with my family as we received the Multigenerational Alumni Family Award given to us.

On the sidelines of the event, Sid or IAC, as he is known in the business community, asked me where I get my inspiration to write my stories. In jest, I pointed to the Macallan on his table, saying it’s my poison and inspiration.

But in reality, as I stood there at both awarding ceremonies, I was reminded of the fact that its in UP indeed where I really learned to dream and pursue the things that inspire me.

As Ely Buendia said, “UP shaped not only our minds but also our souls.”

And from the others who came before us, our professors and fellow alumni included, we found the courage to carry on.

The Eraserheads and their songs, for instance, are vivid reminders of making it from one point to the next, of surviving the hardest of times and eventually thriving with a smile.",0
23,Iris Gonzales,"The Marcos administration can’t pop the champagne just yet even as Filipinos cheered the President’s big pronouncement during his State of the Nation Address, ordering a total ban on the Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs).

Now, his administration needs to do a lot of cleaning up and serious work as part of the post-POGO exit plan.

For one, the government would have to make up for the losses in revenue and business activities from the POGO exit – however insignificant our authorities deem this to be.

Economic managers said the costs of POGO far outweigh the benefits. Still, our taxman would need to find alternative sources of revenue to make up for what would be lost from the POGO industry’s exit from the country.

This is especially urgent with slower fiscal consolidation hounding the Marcos administration now and in the years to come.

Revenue
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), for instance, is now looking at taxing online sellers to raise additional revenue. According to its plan, merchants or sellers in online platforms are now subject to withholding tax effective last month.

BIR’s Revenue Regulation 16-2023 states that one-half of the gross remittances of e-marketplace operations and digital financial services providers to the sellers or merchants for goods or services shall now be subject to a one percent creditable withholding tax.

BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. stresses that this is not a new tax but merely including the sector in the withholding tax system.

It’s not yet clear how much the BIR expects to collect from this sector but with the proliferation of online sellers, it must be significant.

Will this make up for the taxes collected from POGOs? We’ll have to wait and see.

Taxes collected from POGOs more than doubled to almost P10.3 billion last year although still below the expected P32 billion when the Duterte administration passed the POGO Law in 2021.

From January to May this year, BIR data showed that taxes from POGOs already reached P14 billion – consisting of income, franchise, withholding, documentary and other taxes. This does not yet included license fees and share of the government in gaming revenues.

Will the BIR’s plan to tax online merchants yield billions in taxes, too? As I said, we’ll have to wait and see.

Additionally, the government would have to find new sources to plug the revenue losses that would inevitably appear in the trail of the POGO exit if only to fully realize the benefits of banning the industry.

Office market
Colliers also said the POGO ban is expected to push office vacancy rate to 22 percent by the end of the year from 19.3 percent in 2023. That’s a breach of the 20 percent level.

Thus, Colliers said real estate owners should make strategic adjustments to spaces previously tenanted by POGOs to cushion the impact of the industry’s exit from Metro Manila’s office market.

Colliers said POGOs occupied about 489,000 square meters of office space in Metro Manila as of end-June, or about 3.5 percent of the total office stock, as The STAR’s Richmond Mercurio reported last week.

In the office market universe, this is not that huge, considering that it represents only 3.5 percent of the inventory but whether we like it or not, this would still be significant enough to influence rental rates and related businesses.

Against this backdrop, Colliers said landlords, particularly those with high exposure to POGO tenants, should consider implementing various strategic adjustments.

“These include providing commercial concessions such as lower base rents, tenant improvement allowances and rent-free fit-out periods to make space more marketable to clients,” Colliers said.

Indirect benefits
There are other indirect benefits derived from the POGO sector, as the Department of Finance pointed out. These include compensation to laborers whose disposable income is spent on goods and services that generate economic activities.

DOF estimates the direct and indirect benefits of POGOs amount to roughly P166.49 billion a year.

But as reported by our public finance reporter Louise Maureen Simeon, the DOF’s cost-benefit analysis shows that the costs of POGOs are higher at P265.7 billion.

A huge part of this comes from supposed foregone revenues from investments and tourism due to the negative picture associated with criminal activities of illegal POGOs.

And this is where the Marcos administration needs to do a lot of cleaning up.

Simply banning POGOs does not necessarily mean that criminals and syndicates operating in the Philippines’ labyrinthine underworld will disappear or retire.

Our authorities must seriously investigate and bring to justice perpetrators of money laundering, peddlers of fake birth certificates and possibly, human traffickers. Otherwise such harmful and unspeakable acts will continue to hound us even after the POGO ban.

As what usually happens, syndicates behind organized crime may just lie low for a while until the spotlight dims; they would then reinvent themselves when the dust clears and continue perpetrating their crimes.

More importantly, authorities must keep an eye on illegal operators after the ban. E-sabong, jueteng and other similar activities have long been banned but have they really been fully eradicated?

Industry sources say otherwise.

Thus, authorities must pursue cases against perpetrators of crimes and their coddlers in high places.

Along with these efforts, the government must rid itself of bureaucratic red tape and corruption.

Only then can we send a message to legitimate investors that the Philippines is now a safe and friendly place to do business.

24,Iris Gonzales,"My late grandfather Jorge A. Gonzales, an outstanding individual who lived through World War II, put up a small fleet of jeepneys which served the route between Cubao and the University of the Philippines-Diliman campus.

He did this to help students coming from the Cubao area get to their classes on time.

My grandfather was a UP alumnus so he knew the need for transportation to and from the sprawling campus. When he graduated from the UP College of Law, he went on to practice law but at the same time, put up small businesses, including a barbershop and that fleet of jeepneys.

It complemented the UP Ikot route, which in turn was put up by the pioneer of the UP Ikot, Lolo Neong Odoy, so that students don’t have to walk long distances in between colleges in the 493-hectare campus.

This was during the postbellum era of the late 40s and early 50s, a time of rebuilding and recovering, of standing and helping each other rise from the devastating and paralyzing effects of the Second World War.

Back then, the jeepneys served the citizens well. The jeeps were a surplus from wartime and were sold and resold when the Americans left, paving the way for cheap public transportation for Filipinos.

Fast forward to today and we’re now on the way to phasing out jeepneys.

Is it a wise move?
Perhaps even my grandfather would agree that the jeepney, while it was fit for our roads during the postwar era and in the few decades after, is no longer the best public transportation we can offer Filipino commuters in this day and age. These 5,000-kilogram machines have become outmoded, what with all the changes that came with the times.

Our roads have become too crowded for the jeepneys and our streets too polluted for commuters to endure long rides in an open and exposed vehicle such as the jeepney.

As we develop, we really should provide Filipino commuters better but still affordable mobility options. These include other types of vehicles.

Had the government supported the jeepney manufacturers early on, we wouldn’t be taking this long to modernize our jeepneys. They could have evolved into producers of other types of vehicles under a brand that is truly Filipino. They could have updated the jeepneys to fit with the changing times. But they were always on their own.

But that’s water under the bridge now.

At present, the focus is to push through with PUV modernization.

I believe it’s about time this happens but of course it should not come at the expense of the drivers and other stakeholders who rely on the jeepneys to earn a living.

Transportation Secretary Jaime “JJB” Bautista has submitted a 100-page letter to Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero regarding the suspension of the Public Transportation Modernization Program (PTMP).

This came after senators said they would push for the suspension of the program.

Responding to the different points raised against the program, Sec. JJB stressed that the PTMP does not require PUV operators and drivers to immediately purchase modern PUVs upon consolidation. Instead, PUV modernization will occur gradually over the next three to four years after the consolidation deadline.

“We also want to assure the Senate committee that PNS and greenhouse gas emission-compliant modern jeepney units available on the market are not limited to foreign and imported manufacturers. In fact, modern jeepney units are also produced by well-known local manufacturers,” Bautista said in his letter dated July 29, 2024.

“The DOTr also remains committed to preserving the iconic design of our traditional jeepneys and encourages all local manufacturers and importers of PUVs to emulate the artistic design of traditional PUJs,” he also said.

This measure, Sec. Bautista said, aims to preserve the country’s cultural heritage while adhering to the relevant enforceable PNS or Philippine National Standards.

In his letter, the DOTr chief also warned of the potential effects of suspending PTMP as follows:

• Stakeholder impact. Suspending PTMP at this stage of its implementation could disrupt services for many who depend on its benefits. This could undermine progress and damage relationships with stakeholders, particularly, given that a significant percentage thereof have already consolidated.

• Resource utilization. Further, significant resources have already been invested in developing and implementing the PTMP.

In 2024 alone, the government has already appropriated the amount of P1.6 billion for the program. As it was furthered by the (Senate) committee, the program’s utilization rate is already at 53 percent of the P7.5-billion budget from 2018 to 2024. Suspending the program now risks wasting these investments and incurring additional costs to reestablish similar initiatives in the future.

As of April 30, 2024, the franchise consolidation process has reached 83.38 percent with 159,862 out of the 1919,730 baseline units consolidated. In total, there are 6,090 consolidated routes for PUJs, UVEs (UV Express), minibuses and PUBs (public utility buses), data from DOTr also showed.

Ways forward
In conclusion, Sec. JJB said, “We respectfully beseech the Honorable Senate to consider the ongoing benefits and improvements of PTMP. A temporary suspension might not only halt the positive momentum of the program, but could also have unintended negative consequences.”

Every paradigm shift has its challenges. Not everyone will be happy but the goal is for the changes to benefit the majority and more importantly, for the benefits to outweigh the drawbacks.

What happens next remains to be seen.",0
25,Iris Gonzales,"It’s a day celebrated not just in Japan but in different parts of the world, hosted by Japanese embassies across the globe.

But here in our country, the celebration of the birthday of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan is always extra special because it combines the best of Japanese hospitality and the warmth of the Filipino, not to mention the gastronomic delight of traditional Japanese cuisine and good servings of polished sake, often prepared together by Japanese and Filipino chefs.

Friday night at the Ty-owned Grand Hyatt Manila was no exception as Ambassador Koshikawa Kazuhiko hosted the annual National Day Reception to celebrate the 64th birthday of His Majesty the Emperor.

Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin graced the event and led the toast in honor of “the health of His Majesty the Emperor, the continued peace and prosperity of the Japanese people and the lasting friendship between the Philippines and Japan.”

It was indeed an evening of friendship, with government officials, lawmakers, tycoons and friends of the Japanese embassy in Manila descending into the glittering ballroom of Grand Hyatt in Taguig, some as early as the sun set in the city.

It was a fitting venue to celebrate a milestone for Japan because, as we all know, the Ty Group has been consistently instrumental in strengthening our country’s ties with Japan through its partnerships with some of the sogo shoshas from the so-called Land of the Rising Sun.

Not surprisingly, the Ty brothers, Arthur and Alfred, dapper in their suits, were there that evening; you can be sure it’s really an important event when Arthur, who isn’t usually seen in big crowds, makes a rare public appearance.

In his speech, Amb. Koshikawa reflected on the dramatic growth of Japan-Philippine relations. He lauded the mutual visit of President Marcos to Japan and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s visit to the Philippines in 2023, emphasizing the significance of these actions in reaffirming friendly relations between the two countries and setting a course for the future.

Economic cooperation
The evening wouldn’t be complete without talking about economic cooperation, and Amb. Koshikawa did just that as he underscored Japan’s commitment to strong economic ties with the Philippines.

A testament to this, he said, are the Japan-backed important infrastructure projects such as the Metro Manila Subway, the North-South Commuter Railway, the Davao Bypass, as well as the Mindanao peace process.

He also raised the importance of security cooperation, mentioning the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) that is under negotiation between Japan and the Philippines and the Official Security Assistance (OSA). RAA is aimed at facilitating cooperation between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Japan Self-Defense Force while OSA is for the provision of coastal radar systems.

Hello Ja-Fun!
Amb. Koshikawa also happily reported that because of a post-pandemic resurgence of tourism, the number of Filipinos going to Japan reached a record high last year.

There were 622,268 Filipinos who went to Japan, exceeding the pre-pandemic figures of 613,114 recorded in 2019, according to data from the Japan National Tourism Organization.

VIPs who filled the stage for the toast included House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Charles John Brown.

Also spotted that night were former prime minister Cesar Virata, Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity Carlito Galvez and members of the diplomatic community.

Tycoons, businessmen and executives also took time out of their busy schedules to join the festivities. Aside from the Ty brothers, I also saw Cecilio Pedro, founder of Lamoiyan Corp., the company behind the popular Hapee toothpaste brand; Edgard Cabangon, chairman of ALC Group of Companies and Yoji Kawaguchi, president of Mitsukoshi Federal Retail Inc.

New Toyota Philippines prexy
Just as I was chatting with Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP) chairman Alfred Ty, whom I congratulated for Grand Hyatt’s successful hosting of the event that night and the official turnover of the TMP presidency, newly appointed TMP president Masando Hashimoto walks by.

At last, I had the opportunity to finally congratulate Hashimoto because I wasn’t able to talk to him during the turnover ceremony held in the same glittering ballroom just a few days ago.

Hashimoto assumed leadership from Atsuhiro Okamato, who in turn, described his tenure in the Philippines as his most memorable, what with the Pinatubo eruption and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Going back to the Friday’s Japan National Day celebration, there were many other notable guests but one who stood out was the indefatigable and energetic Ramon S. Ang or RSA who arrived just as the program was about to start.

In no time, RSA was swarmed by well-wishers – including a rival bidder – congratulating him for his recent victory in the Ninoy Aquino International Airport bidding.

But it was not only his NAIA win that earned him praises, but also for Gilas Pilipinas’ landslide win against Hong Kong in the recent FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers.

That night, everyone wanted a minute of RSA’s time and he gave it. He was really visibly happy with what seems to be an alignment of stars for San Miguel Corp., the diversified conglomerate that he leads.

Overall, Japan’s National Day reception in the Philippines was a lovely evening not just to celebrate the oldest monarchy in the world, but to mark the good friendship it has built with other countries, including ours, through the years.

I, too, offer my warmest felicitations to Japan on its special day.",0
26,Iris Gonzales,"Legal luminary Ricardo Romulo, longtime chairman of Romulo Mabanta Buenaventura Sayoc & De Los Angeles, has sold his stake in the esteemed law firm to his five partners, who are among the biggest names in Philippine law. 

They are Cynthia del Castillo, Jose Salvador Mirasol, Louie Ogsimer, Herminio Ozaeta Jr. and Perry Pe.

Following the sale last year, the law firm announced that it will adopt the trade name “Romulo Buenaventura” starting March 1, 2025.

The trade name Romulo Buenaventura honors Romulo, who is now the firm’s chairman emeritus, and its current chairman, Jose “Chito” Buenaventura.

What do these changes mean for the law firm which is among the biggest in the country?
Insiders said Romulo Buenaventura will pave the way for the entry of a younger generation of lawyers but will continue to be among the largest and highly regarded law firms in the country with a full offering of legal services.

Indeed, Romulo Buenaventura intends to continue its long tradition of exemplary legal service, which dates way back to the early 1900s, when it operated as Gibbs and McDonough.

Its storied history, in the company’s own words:
“Romulo traces its roots to the law firm which Allison D. Gibbs and William Kincaid established in 1902. At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898, Allison D. Gibbs and William Kincaid arrived in the Philippines as part of the Colorado and Nebraska volunteers, respectively. After the war, they decided to settle in the Philippines and engage in the practice of law. They hung their shingle in the business center of Manila in No. 9 Plaza Moraga.

“The firm was reorganized several times until Charles McDonough was admitted into the partnership. Allison D. Gibbs’ sons, Findley and Allison J., would later join the firm as assistant attorneys while an upstart Filipino lawyer by the name of Roman Ozaeta was admitted as partner in 1931.
“In 1936, Roman Ozaeta resigned from the firm to become judge of the then Court of First Instance. He went on to become Solicitor General in 1938, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in 1941, Secretary of Justice in 1946 and again an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1948 to 1950.
“Justice Roman Ozaeta was the first Filipino partner. He and his son Herminio reconstituted the firm in the 1950s after the firm had gone through so many name changes because of the rule then that only living partners must be named in a law firm partnership. It finally settled as Romulo Mabanta Buenaventura Sayoc & De Los Angeles in the early 1980s.”

Fast forward to today. The law firm has a new name but has committed to continue the same legacy of excellence. Congratulations, Romulo Buenaventura, as you mark a new chapter in your colorful and storied journey.

The property sector, the real score. There’s a lot of speculation going around wondering if the property sector is indeed in trouble amid oversupply after the POGO exodus.

Well, guess what? Yes, there’s excess supply but experts said the best time to buy is now. Who was it who said that the best time to buy is when there’s blood in the streets?

There’s no blood in the streets – or at least not yet – but industry players said that the sector remains strong and steady amid strong economic fundamentals. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has maintained its benchmark interest rate at 5.75 percent, ensuring access to affordable financing for homebuyers and investors.

As of December 2024, the annual inflation rate stood at 2.9 percent, still within the central bank’s target range of two percent to four percent. Economic growth for the year is seen at six percent to eight percent, which indicates sustained economic expansion. Election spending from the May polls is also expected to boost economic activity. As for demand, this remains significant for the mid-range to upscale condominiums. But is there an oversupply? Yes, some areas do have an oversupply, but big developers with strong balance sheets continue to find and complete pre-selling projects, ensuring confidence in the market, industry sources told me.

I also learned that developers are also making it easier for buyers to acquire condos now with even lower down payment, flexible amortization terms and step-up financing. This makes it easier for both first-time buyers and seasoned investors to acquire properties.

I had dinner recently with the chairman of a property company and he isn’t worried. Demand may slow down, he said, but not enough for developers to stop building. At the end of the day, he said, property assets remain a sound investment, especially in well located areas. Condos in prime locations likewise remain highly rentable, with steady supply demand from young professionals. Acquiring property is also a hedge against inflation because unlike other asset classes, real estate appreciates over time.

Thus, if you are looking for a sound investment and you have money to spare, it would be good to acquire property now, especially with developers likely to hold off any price hikes in the next two years or until the market absorbs the excess supply. But perhaps for property developers, they could also use this time to slow down construction in Metro Manila and build in other locations because the capital region is really becoming way too crowded.",0
27,Iris Gonzales,"As Trump 2.0 begins, we can take a page from his plan to make the American government more efficient.
We don’t need to get someone like Elon Musk to spearhead it but we can learn from it and apply it to our own bureaucracy, which definitely needs a lot of fixing.
There’s just too many cobwebs that make it difficult for ordinary citizens to avail themselves of needed government services. These cobwebs also make the bureaucracy prone to corruption.
Efficiency
Thus, we need to make our bureaucracy more efficient. This way, government agencies can function better.
For instance, if state-owned health insurer PhilHealth had been more efficient in fulfilling its mandate – from paying its obligations to hospitals on time and improving its benefits to members – it would not have billions in idle funds, of which P60 billion ended up being impounded by the government, no thanks to its inefficiency.
Let the 2025 budget mess serve as a lesson for government agencies. Now we know that the our lawmakers and our fiscal authorities are on the lookout for idle funds they can dip their hands into, partly for money-making ventures; campaign funds, perhaps, ahead of the 2025 and 2028 elections or kitty for continued political patronage to keep themselves in power.
What does this mean for government agencies and government-owned corporations? This means that if you don’t use your funds well, you might as well say goodbye to your agency’s money.
Lawmakers and our fiscal authorities are on a purge of sorts, looking for funds they can impound.
This is what happened to state-owned deposit insurer Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. A portion of its Deposit Insurance Fund – P107.23 billion – has been reallocated to the Treasury.
An efficient government agency is one that is able to fulfill its functions and mandate with the resources allotted for it by the government; it can likewise do its own fund-raising if necessary.
Overpriced projects
Aside from an efficient bureaucracy, we also need fiscal discipline.
Department heads and heads of other government agencies can’t just treat taxpayers’ money as if it were their own.
Spending on overpriced campaigns, ugly logos, slogans, giveaways, Christmas parties, etc., is a disservice to the nation.
While these expenses or projects are allowed, spending so much more than the actual cost is corruption. Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto has shown us that government projects can be built at cost, meaning no overpricing, no corruption.
As it is now, however, what is happening is that heads of government agencies, sometimes in cahoots with lawmakers, spend taxpayers’ money recklessly.
They don’t have fiscal discipline and no conscience can stop them. Their priority is making kickbacks.
A reader, Alex Serrano, shared the same observation, noting that the Marcos administration, it seems, has been throwing fiscal discipline out the window.
This shouldn’t be the case, he said, especially because our economy is still struggling.
It’s also time to revisit plans to reduce the number of government agencies and government-owned and -controlled corporations.
There are just too many useless offices with redundant functions. For instance, there are quite a number of housing agencies and yet, our housing problem just keeps getting worse. There are also a lot of lending or guarantee agencies that have similar functions to that of the Development Bank of the Philippines and the Land Bank of the Philippines.
As I said, we can certainly learn from Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Of course, we have yet to see if he will succeed, but at least in the US, they’re actually making it happen.
According to The New York Times, Musk and his group of “Silicon Valley-inflected, wide-eyed recruits will be deployed to Washington’s alphabet soup of agencies. The goal is for most major agencies to eventually have two DOGE representatives as they seek to cut costs, like Mr. Musk did at X, his social media platform.”
These executives will see how the US government works and perhaps see how operations can be improved. For instance, what functions can be removed, what redundancies can be addressed and other areas for improvement.
We need to do something like this as well. Enter a typical frontline government office, and you will most likely see a sea of government employees behind their desks and yet, the office is still inefficient in rendering service to the public. You’re lucky if someone attends to your needs.
In the case of Musk’s DOGE, Musk initially said the effort could result in “at least $2 trillion” in cuts from the $6.75-trillion federal budget.
I’m sure that if we seriously study our bureaucracy, there are ways to cut costs by making it more efficient but without sacrificing service to the public.
This would also make the bureaucracy less prone to corruption.
Privatization
Some government functions may also be privatized. I dare say, for example, some functions of the Bureau of Customs or the whole agency altogether, but that, of course, is a discussion I’ll save for another column.
For now, we must heed the lessons from the 2025 budget mess by making the government more efficient. Hopefully, this would translate to much-needed savings which our government can then reallocate for social services such as health care and education.

28,Iris Gonzales,"Those before us liked to say that we must study history so that we can learn from the mistakes of the past and heed the lessons as we move toward the future.

The other day, I flipped through the late Sen. Ninoy Aquino’s compilation of speeches titled, “A Garrison State in the Making and Other Speeches.” These were mostly delivered in Congress during the late ’60s to early ’70s.

One speech caught my attention because it felt like it was written in the present day – “Mr. Marcos and Congress: A Black Cabal,” delivered on Feb. 25, 1971, at the Senate then led by Senate president Gil Puyat.

Here are excerpts:

“I was dealt a sobering shock as I studied the 1970 national budget. President Marcos, I read there, had caused some P26 million of the General Fund to be transferred to the appropriation of the House of Representatives. It was not an illegal act, I hold; in truth, it was legal.

“But Mr. Marcos abused his authority as provided in Section 6 of the general provisions of the Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1970. As the law goes, it was an act beyond question.

“But is it moral? Another question pressed in my mind: What was behind it? Why did the House find the need for a presidential transfusion when it had projected its budget needs and could have voted itself any amount without interference from the Budget Commissioner?”

The breakdown of the P26 million is as follows as detailed by Sen. Ninoy:

• Transferred from the Department of Finance to the House: P4.3 million

• Transferred from the Department of Justice to the House: P1.4 million

• Transferred from the Executive Office to the House: P5.7 million

• Transferred from the Department of National Defense to the House: P8.8 million

• Transferred from the Rural Improvement & Community Development Fund, which Sen. Ninoy describes as “the unkindest cut of all:” P6 million

• Transferred from savings and appropriation of the Executive Department: P54,727.

This amounts to a total of P26 million transferred to the House, over and above the approved appropriations for the House, which amounted to P39 million, Sen. Ninoy said.

“The people, I must tell you, want to rekindle faith in government. But with examples such as these, can we regain their faith? I think not, Mr. President. If you were they, will you? But I believe there is still one last chance for us to do. We can begin, for example, by letting the truth out. Yes, Mr. President, we must be told the specifics of the P26-million transfers. The whys and the wherefores must be answered, Mr. President.

“Our people must know who else outside Mr. Marcos were involved in this foul deed – this collusion of the governing politicians against the Filipino people.”

There are just portions of Sen. Ninoy’s speech but one can already see how awfully familiar the circumstances and the problems are. The resemblance to the present day is uncanny. Mr. Marcos in the speech is, of course, Ferdinand Sr. but the difference seems to end there. The immoral transfers and reallocations as well as the cuts from other offices were all familiar.

Even the amount of P26 million reminds me of the P26-billion AKAP funds in the 2025 budget which were taken from other agencies’ appropriations.

Imagine this was in 1971. I wasn’t even born yet at the time. Now, 53 years later, history clearly repeats itself.

When will we ever learn? When will we finally heed the lessons of the past? Hopefully in the coming elections.

PhilHealth responds
PhilHealth responded to my fiscal discipline column published on Tuesday.

“We would like to inform you that PhilHealth has disbursed a total of P165.33 billion in claims payments from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2024, with an average turnaround time of 24 days. This is 36 days faster than the 60-day processing period prescribed under Republic Act 10606.”

Addressing denied claims
“We would also like to emphasize that not all claims submitted are ‘good claims’ or valid for payment. Claims may be returned to hospitals due to discrepancies in entries, incomplete or inconsistent documentation or improperly filled forms. Meanwhile, some claims are denied payment due to late filing or re-filing, non-compensable cases or issues related to the hospital’s accreditation.

“The seeming discrepancy in figures between PhilHealth and the hospitals’ reports may be due to differences in accounting treatment. During reconciliation, it was noted that hospitals have been including denied and returned-to-hospital claims in their accounts receivables while PhilHealth recognizes only good claims as its payables, pursuant to prevailing government accounting rules and regulations.

“To address the incidence of returned and denied claims, PhilHealth actively engages hospitals nationwide through education on updated claims policies, guidelines and requirements.”

Enhancing benefits
“Regarding benefit enhancements, PhilHealth is achieving its targets as outlined in its Board-approved benefit plan. This is cognizant of the need to increase our support value to our members.”

It said that at least 33 benefit enhancements have been introduced over the past two years.

Recent enhancements include benefit packages for acute myocardial infarction, peritoneal dialysis, emergency care, kidney transplantation and cataract extraction, PhilHealth said.

New packages have also been introduced, such as preventive oral health services, physical rehabilitation services and optometric services for children.

Thank you, PhilHealth, for your response.

I am one with the public in hoping for a better PhilHealth in the years to come.",0
29,Iris Gonzales,"I had the chance to listen to celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay when he met with the culinary community at the Newport Performing Arts Theater recently.

The Michelin-starred chef was all praises for our cuisine and the country’s local culinary talent.


Not surprisingly, the crowd loved him and soon enough, he was all over social media.

Filipino cuisine, for him, “is the ‘Sleeping Beauty of Asia’.” “It’s high up there in Southeast Asia and can give a big kick in the ass and really become one of the frontrunners of Asia,” he said.

And while I wouldn’t consider myself a hardcore foodie – although I very much love good food – I, too, was proud to hear the British chef’s appreciation of Filipino cuisine.

One post on social media, however, caught my attention because, more than Ramsay’s validation, it talked about putting a spotlight on the incredible work done by Filipino chefs.

I saw it on the Instagram page of Chef JP Anglo, whose dishes I truly enjoyed during a Philippine Airlines trip to the US some years back.

Written by Chef Budgie Montoya of Sarap London, the article titled, The Sleeping Beauty Awakes: Filipino Cuisine, Bourdain, Ramsay and Us, has been making the rounds on social media.

Here are excerpts:

“Filipino cuisine has spent decades flirting with global recognition, often heralded as the ‘next big thing’ but never quite stepping into the spotlight.

“Two powerful moments encapsulate this narrative. The first was Anthony Bourdain’s heartfelt declaration of sisig as the ‘gateway dish’ to Filipino food. A dish he predicted could ‘win the hearts and minds of the world.’ The second is Gordon Ramsay’s recent visit to the Philippines, where he described Filipino cuisine as the ‘Sleeping Beauty of Asia,’ praising its depth, diversity and untapped potential.

“Both moments sparked waves of pride and action among Filipinos. Each time, there was a collective rallying cry: This is our moment.

“Yet, while Bourdain’s and Ramsay’s endorsements are undeniably meaningful, they also reveal an uncomfortable truth: we still seem to crave validation from the West.

“We celebrate when celebrity Western chefs discover our food, but we don’t shine nearly as bright a spotlight on the incredible work being done by Filipino chefs, restaurateurs and food entrepreneurs who are already shaping the future of Filipino cuisine.”

Chef Budgie was very much on point – the real power to define and share our cuisine lies within us.

The proof?

“Look no further than the Filipinos who are breaking barriers, achieving greatness and inspiring the next generation, not because someone ‘discovered’ them, but because they believed in their craft and worked relentlessly to share it with the world.”

He was quick to say though that this isn’t about dismissing the praise of Bourdain and Ramsay.

But there’s a pattern, Chef Budgie said – someone from the west points to our food and we celebrate, only for the momentum to fade.

“Why does it feel like we’re always on the brink, stuck in a cycle of being rediscovered but never quite arriving?” he pointed out.

Filipino excellence: Breaking barriers, building legacies
“The truth is, Filipino cuisine isn’t waiting to be discovered, it’s already making waves, thanks to the hard work of Filipinos who believe in its power. Consider Kasama in Chicago, the first Filipino restaurant in the world to earn a Michelin star. Chefs Timothy Flores and Genie Kwon didn’t dilute their vision to cater to anyone; they created a tasting menu rooted in Filipino flavors, unapologetically and beautifully.

“Their success is a testament to what happens when we tell our own stories, our way,” Chef Budgie said.

I agree with Chef Budgie. We need to celebrate our own stories instead of waiting for others to celebrate for us.

Shining the spotlight on us
“There’s nothing wrong with feeling proud when someone like Ramsay or Bourdain praises our food. It’s a beautiful thing to see people appreciate what we’ve always loved. But let’s make something clear: their words shouldn’t outshine the work of Filipinos who are already putting in the effort.

“The real stars of this story are the people who keep pushing forward, even when no one is watching. The chefs opening small restaurants in neighborhoods where no one expects them to succeed. The farmers growing the ingredients that bring our dishes to life. The entrepreneurs taking the risk to bottle our flavors and share them with the world. The storytellers and influencers reminding us why our food matters.”

Indeed, we need to celebrate our very own – louder than anyone else’s voices. He cites Erwan Heussaff, who uses his influence to celebrate and document Filipino food, as a model for how we can champion our cuisine, not just for the world, but for ourselves.

Chef Budgie’s piece is just so poignant and beautiful and it hits right home. True enough, there are so many reasons to be proud of our Filipino chefs.

There’s Chef JP whose restaurants in Dubai have made Pinoys proud. I also had a gastronomic adventure at Purple Patch, one of the first Filipino restaurants in Washington and at the Gugu Room, a Filipino-Japanese izakaya located in the Lower East Side, New York.

These places make me proud.

Chef Budgie’s point also goes beyond cuisine. Often, we only start celebrating Filipino milestones when people from the West take notice.

It’s time we ourselves tell and celebrate our own stories.

After all, as Chef Budgie said, “Sleeping Beauty is indeed alive, awake and full of heart.”",0
30,Iris Gonzales,"As the sun set over Metro Manila yesterday, a new dawn broke at the office of The Philippine STAR, the country’s leading newspaper.

Government officials and some of the country’s tycoons descended on The STAR’s new headquarters, a five-story building located on a 4,800-square-meter lot inside Amvel Business Park in Parañaque, for the building’s inauguration and blessing.

A symbolic ribbon cutting ushered in a new chapter for the newspaper founded by veteran journalists Max Soliven, Betty Go-Belmonte and Art Borjal 38 years ago on the heels of the people power revolt.

MVP Group chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan led the cutting of the trademark yellow “Philippine STAR” ribbon in a ceremony held at the lobby of the new building. Joining him were The STAR president and CEO Miguel Belmonte, editor-in-chief Ana Marie Pamintuan, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin.

“Congratulations to The STAR. We’ve done very well. It’s a tribute to the management team,” Pangilinan said.

In his speech, Belmonte said yesterday’s ceremony wasn’t just to celebrate a new structure, but a new chapter – a new dawn – for The Philippine STAR.

‘For close to four decades, The Philippine STAR has been a guiding light to millions of Filipinos. We have navigated through pivotal moments in our nation’s history, stood at the forefront of change and shone a light on truth and accountability.

“As we flip to the next chapters of The Philippine STAR, we are reminded of how far we have come – from our humble beginnings to becoming one of the most trusted and respected pillars of Philippine journalism, our journey guided by an unwavering commitment to truth, excellence and service to the Filipino people,” Belmonte said.

For his part, Bersamin, in his message, said, “For decades, The Philippine Star has been more than a news source. It has been a critical force in shaping Filipino society and safeguarding our democracy.”

He said the newspaper has empowered citizens to make informed decisions in our nation’s daily life, as well as to hold our officials and leaders accountable.

The Philippine STAR, Bersamin added, has chronicled our nation’s journey in times of triumph and turbulence with unflinching candor and directness.

“May The Philippine STAR continue to be a beacon of truth and democracy for generations to come,” he said.

First Lady Liza Marcos, in a video message, said the new building marks a new chapter for the newspaper and is a testament to its continued growth.

Bersamin led the esteemed guests from the government who also included Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go as well as local executives Parañaque Mayor Eric Olivarez and Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte. Lawmakers who attended were Senator Cynthia Villar and daughter Camille, Rep. Edwin Olivarez and Rep. Mariano Michael Velarde.

Some of the tycoons and businessmen who graced the occasion included Robina Gokongwei-Pe, Zobel brothers Fernando and Jaime Augusto, Kevin Tan, Tessie Sy-Coson, Hans Sy and Thomas Mirasol.

The STAR Board members in attendance included chairman Ricky Vargas, Danny Yu, Marife Zamora, Leo Posadas and Jane Basas.

From the Belmonte family, present were former speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. and sons Isaac and Kevin, who are also on The STAR board, Isa Belmonte, Milette Belmonte and Ray Alimurung.

Also joining the event were OB Montessori president Sara Soliven, Amvel Land Development Corp.'s Dr. Franklin Velarde, and Philippines Yearbook chairman Grace Glory Go.

It was indeed an event graced by The STAR’s stakeholders to celebrate the newspaper’s past, present and future

As the event’s host Danie Laurel said, “The STAR’s aligned to where it is today.”",0
31,Iris Gonzales,"When one mentions EDSA, motorists and commuters alike will almost certainly feel that familiar sense of dread– dread of the legendary traffic we endure long before we actually reach Metro Manila’s main thoroughfare. We feel it on any given day, including Sundays, and experience it before, during and after we’re actually plying the busy road.

And yet, the 23-kilometer highway also gives us access to almost anywhere. Pass by EDSA, and you can get to any part of the metropolis – north, south, east, west or beyond.

EDSA and its role in our lives – or these two extreme experiences of being stuck and being able to move forward – are the perfect metaphor to describe what the historic EDSA Revolution of Feb. 25, 1986 brought to our country.

It brought us hope – such fervent hope – and the promise of a better tomorrow.

I am reminded of what Charles Dickens said in “A Tale of Two Cities:”

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.”

Thirty-nine years later, I still believe, as I did then, that EDSA held the promise of a better tomorrow. It was a moment in our history that was necessary. It had to happen because the two-decade dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., which set our country and economy back – to this day – had to end. EDSA was the change our country needed during that tumultuous period in our history.

But what happened after was a failure in governance, a lack of follow-through and a typical Filipino trait: ningas-kugon, or fleeting enthusiasm.

It left us a new constitution – the 1987 Constitution – which allowed corrupt officials to return to power through a multi-party system.

It didn’t help that those who ruled after EDSA became the ogres they initially tried to slay, although sadly, this is typical in countries that overthrew dictators.

Take Libya, for example. In 2011, the country overthrew its long-time dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, but failed to transition into a better nation. Today, it remains plagued by civil war as different groups continue to fight for power.

Egypt, too, ousted Hosni Mubarak in 2011, but today, the country is considered the second most vulnerable to a debt crisis, and hopes for democratic change remain elusive under the El-Sisi regime and its new brand of authoritarianism.

Yemen ousted its dictator, Ali Abdullah Saleh, in 2011, but to this day, the country continues to face multiple crises, including the Houthi rebellion, which remains a threat to lasting peace.

If we compare ourselves to these countries, we can surely heave a sigh of relief – maybe even pop the champagne bottles.

After all, we have reasons to do so – there are no gunfights or blood on the streets, no refugee camps and no violent disruptions in our daily lives.

Deep state
But if we look closer, we might actually have it worse, to a certain extent.

This is because what exists in our country today is a deep state of sorts – a parallel, elite-driven secret network that seems to manipulate policy to favor the powerful few and maintain the status quo that protects them.

The result is the stark and widening income inequality in our country today.

How did we get here?

There are many reasons.

First, we must look at how Corazon Aquino and her successors failed to do enough to protect the gains of EDSA. It was an opportunity to create stronger institutions – from justice to education to health – to build a more inclusive economy and lift millions out of poverty.

But incompetence, in-fighting during the Aquino administration, the power struggles within the Yellow Camp, the disappointment and disillusionment that followed and the failed coups d’état all pushed our country backward.

The people, too, forgot that the revolution was not just a three-day affair – it was an ongoing battle.

Thus, in the years that followed, it was more of the same – an elite-driven economy that isolated the poorest of the poor.

As such, the poverty incidence in the Philippines – or the proportion of Filipinos whose per capita income cannot sufficiently meet the individual basic food and non-food needs – was recorded at 18.1 percent in 2021 from 16.7 percent in 2018. This translates to around 19.99 million Filipinos living below the poverty threshold of about P12,030 per month for a family of five, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).

And now, here we are again, back to another Marcos presidency.

As I wrote in 2023 for PhilStar Life:

“With the EDSA Revolution in the middle of our long, storied journey, the Philippines is in many ways still in limbo. We are in that spring of hope and yet, also in the winter of despair.

“In many ways, it’s exactly like EDSA, the avenue – a few good lanes but riddled with countless potholes and all.”

And may I add – with a bus lane for the masses that is constantly abused by the entitled and the elite, as with many things in our country today.",0
32,Iris Gonzales,"From the Sulu archipelago to the West Philippine Sea, the promise of the blue economy runs deep, as deep as the blue waters that glisten under the Philippine sun.

For Professor Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, the Philippines needs a new paradigm shift – one that embraces the blue economy while prioritizing sustainable development.

This is especially critical amid the controversies surrounding the West Philippine Sea.

The blue economy, according to Oxford, refers to an economic system or sector that seeks to conserve marine and freshwater environments while using them in a sustainable way to develop economic growth and produce resources such as energy and food.

“For communities whose livelihoods are inextricably linked to the sea, traditional economic models often fall short, leaving them underserved by national funding allocations,” Prof. Batongbacal said at the “Embracing the Currents: An International Conference on the Sulu Archipelago,” held late last year at the Mindanao State University in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi.

An oceanic university
Fortunately, Prof. Batongbacal said, UP is doing its share in addressing this need through its plan to establish the so-called Archipelagic and Oceanic Virtual University (AOVU).

UP president Angelo Jimenez introduced the AOVU last year, which is poised to reshape how the nation manages its marine resources.

“The AOVU represents a significant shift in approach, recognizing that the archipelago’s future lies in its waters. This will strengthen and empower the Philippines to take possession of its territory and utilize its sovereign rights over its resources. It will also help operationalize the Blue Economy Act once it is passed,” Prof. Batongbacal said.

I agree with UP’s initiative. The AOVU is one of the university’s flagship programs under president Jimenez.

Essentially, AOVU will serve as a centralized hub for graduate degree programs and research initiatives focused on maritime studies.

The virtual university will initially offer four master’s degree programs: Archipelagic Blue Economics and Engineering, Economic Security and Integrity, Archipelagic and Oceanic Environment and Archipelagic Social Studies.

There will also be new programs and initiatives introduced along the way.

In all, UP said, the AOVU would provide continuing professional education in national security, environmental management and maritime diplomacy.

The initiative also aims to correct the historical imbalance that has favored land-based development, finally giving the sea its due attention, Prof. Batongbacal added.

“One of its goals is to cultivate a strong pool of experts and talent who are part of a national, regional and global network, driving planning, implementation, academic research and innovation programs.”

For sure, these efforts will help us address the unique challenges that we face.

Embracing the blue economy
By embracing the blue economy and prioritizing sustainable development, the AOVU aims to empower communities, strengthen governance and unlock the vast potential of the archipelago’s marine resources.

“As the Philippines navigates the complex challenges of the 21st century, the AOVU stands as a beacon of innovation and a testament to the transformative power of education,” Prof. Batongbacal said.

I laud UP and its leadership for initiatives like this which, hopefully, will educate and empower Filipinos and the succeeding generations in dealing with the challenges of managing our marine resources.

I hope that despite cutbacks in education funding in the General Appropriations Act, this initiative can continue.

Another educational initiative, the Center for West Philippine Sea Studies, is pending in Congress along with the proposed National West Philippine Sea Day. The bill creating the Center for West Philippine Sea Studies aims to create a think tank on how the Philippines can better defend and support its territorial claims in the South China Sea.

National Day Reception
Government officials, tycoons, businessmen and diplomats gathered at the glittering Grand Ballroom of Grand Hyatt Manila on Thursday night for the annual National Day of Japan to celebrate the 65th birthday of His Majesty, the Emperor of Japan.

Ambassador Endo Kazuya led the celebration, his first National Day Reception in the Philippines, and his first as ambassador, while Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ma. Hellen de la Vega graced the event and led the toast.

Other distinguished guests included Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero, Speaker of the House of Representatives Martin Romualdez, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo, Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Charles Brown, AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner, Ambassador to the US Jose “Babe” Romualdez, GSIS president and GM Wick Veloso, tycoon Alfred Ty and his wife Cherry and PAL president Capt. Stanley Ng.

Golden age
In his speech, Ambassador Endo said that in recent years, Japan-Philippines relations have entered what is known as the “Golden Age,” sustained by friendship and shared values.

“Since my arrival in March last year, I have witnessed how we have further deepened our wide range of exchanges and cooperation.

“The historic first Japan-Philippines-US Summit was held shortly after my arrival. In the field of security, the second Japan-Philippines Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meeting was held in July and the Japan-Philippines Reciprocal Access Agreement was then signed. The esteemed Senate of the Philippines went on to concur in the agreement’s ratification last December,” he said.
There are many other reasons to celebrate, he added, including strong economic, retail and cultural ties.

It was indeed a lovely evening filled with sumptuous food and sake and more than enough stories shared among guests throughout the night.",0
33,Iris Gonzales,"When you sit down with some of the country’s tycoons and business executives, especially Filipino-Chinese businessmen, you will easily notice an air of frustration over our politics and politicians.

Only those who are really close to President Marcos, either as an adviser, a friend or as an appointed official, would say that everything’s smooth sailing.

In reality though, many of our big businessmen are growing frustrated and even impatient with our dizzying political landscape – the move to tinker with our budget, glaring corruption among some of our lawmakers and that feeling of “walang nangyayari” under the Marcos administration.

Of course, our businessmen – some of them kingmakers – are partly to blame. They keep on supporting these politicians when candidates ask them for support.

But what if, for a change – or for a much-needed respite from politicians – they field somebody from their own ranks and support him or her instead to become the country’s president?

Would a businessman or a tycoon be an effective president of the Philippines? Someone with effective management and leadership skills who can steer our rudderless ship to better shores? Someone who has the brilliance to manage our resources so that our government can provide the right social services to our people? Someone whose goal is no longer just about making money but building a nation for generations and generations to come?

Of course it’s easy to mistrust businessmen, especially in our country where some people perceive them as just a bunch of greedy and profit-oriented oligarchs who only want to enrich themselves.

In reality though, some of the country’s tycoons care about the country and not just themselves, or at least they care more than our politicians do. Just look at how some of them helped our people during the pandemic. Imagine if they didn’t – where would we be now? They care about the future of their children and grandchildren. Some of them want to leave a lasting legacy so their empires are not forgotten.

In any case, a lot of them have the skills and the proven track record to run an organization effectively, perhaps even more so than some of our politicos, something that we need in our country today,

We’ve had success stories when it comes to our debt-strapped utilities of decades past. When these were privatized and transferred to the hands of business executives, services improved.

Even tollways and airports – though a long way from being world-class – are seeing improvements after being privatized.

After all, people with business acumen move fast and efficiently. They anticipate problems before they arise. They are creative and innovative, too.

So what if, for a change, we elect a businessman as president? I’m sure many of them are qualified, perhaps even more qualified than those currently eyeing the presidency in 2028. Some of them are popular and considered as folk heroes.

Actually, I heard from our Republic of Marites that this is something some of our businessmen are considering because many of them have become so frustrated with our political situation. They are considering the idea of supporting a fellow businessman to run for the presidency. The only question is who it will be.

The United States has done it, and no, I’m not even referring to President Donald Trump. There were success stories in the past.

For instance, there’s George Washington, considered as one of the greatest presidents in US history. He was a wealthy landowner and savvy businessman before he became president. There’s also former haberdasher Harry Truman, ranked by historians as among the top five presidents of the US. Jimmy Carter grew the family business successfully before being elected as president of the US in 1977.

This is perhaps because in the US, citizens were more open to having a businessman for president.

“Plenty of businessmen throughout history have sought – and won – the highest office in the US. Some feel this is a positive, bringing the business acumen and efficiency of the private sector into the halls of state,” according to the Business News Daily.

Of course, having a businessman as president of the republic has its risks and it isn’t a magic pill that will make our problems go away. It can also open the door for corruption and cronyism.

But these are desperate times, as seen in the current crop of politicians and candidates we have. Perhaps, it might be something we can consider instead of just voting the same trapos back into office.

Now will a nation-loving businessman capable of leading this country please stand up?",0
34,Iris Gonzales,"The election circus is here; its caravans are painting the town red – wild, boisterous and full of cheers. The candidates and the crowd are excited, jubilant and happy but I’m anxious, disturbed and jittery.

I can’t help but wonder – what’s going to happen in our country after the May 2025 elections, given the latest survey results on voters’ preference for senators?

This is a question for all thinking men who care about the future of this nation of over 120 million; it is a situation that will affect you, me and everyone we know, whether we like it or not.

The survey results are alarming. Our future senatorial line-up will continue to deteriorate if the survey turns into reality.

This is what happens when every Juan dela Cruz audaciously thinks he or she can be a senator of the Philippine Republic – charlatans who are taking us for fools.

We can blame democracy for this. The qualifications to vie for a Senate seat are very basic – natural-born Filipino citizens, at least 35 years old on election day, able to read and write, a registered voter and a resident of the country.

But if you look at the roster of Filipino statesmen from decades past, it is shameless for some of our current crop of candidates to think that they are qualified to be in the league of the esteemed men and women who, once upon a time in history, walked the august halls of our chamber.

These statesmen are the ones worthy of being called solons, which doesn’t just mean a legislator but a wise and skillful one. The term is derived from Solon himself, an ancient Athenian statesman, lawmaker, political philosopher and poet. He was one of the Seven Sages of Greece.

Among our Filipino statesmen were Jovito Salonga, Lorenzo Tañada, Jose “Pepe” Diokno, Vicente Sotto (not Tito Sotto), Ambrosio Padilla, Blas Ople, Gil Puyat, Benigno Aquino, Eva Estrada-Kalaw, Rene Saguisag.

They must now be rolling in their graves, helpless in protecting the chamber.

It is we, the voters, who must do that now.

But why is it so difficult for Filipinos to vote for change? Why are we so afraid to vote, for instance, for those from the grassroots movement even though they are not well known? Why are we so afraid to vote for new names, new ideas?

Surveys show a disturbing trend. With the exception of a few names, traditional politicians dominate the surveys. Some former celebrities turned lawmakers, including those previously involved in pork barrel scams, and celebrity newcomers who admit not knowing much about lawmaking, are among those in the so-called Magic 12, according to the Jan. 25 to 31 OCTA Research Group survey.

Those in the Magic 12 come from the senatorial slates of the Marcos and Duterte camps.

A PNA article on the latest OCTA survey states:

“Nine candidates backed by the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. are among the probable winners in the 2025 Senate race based on the latest OCTA Research pre-election survey.

“The survey, conducted from Jan. 25 to 31, showed ACT-CIS Party-list Rep. Erwin Tulfo as the most preferred candidate, topping the poll with 70 percent voter preference.”

Former senate president Tito Sotto III ranked third to eighth with 52 percent, Sen. Bong Revilla Jr. ranked fourth to 11th with 49 percent; former senator Panfilo Lacson at fourth to 11th with 48 percent; Sen. Pia Cayetano at fourth to 11th with 46 percent and former senator Manny Pacquiao at fifth to 12th with 45 percent.

Furthermore, Sen. Imee Marcos placed fifth to 13th with 44 percent, while Sen. Lito Lapid ranked fifth to 14th with 43 percent. Former interior secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. secured the ninth to 16th spot with 39 percent, rounding out the administration-backed candidates in the Top 12, according to PNA.

Three non-administration candidates also made the top 12 – Ben Tulfo (second to third with 60 percent); Sen. Bong Go (second to fourth with 58 percent) and TV host Willie Revillame, who is also running as an independent and is tied with Lacson at fourth to 11th with 48 percent.

The nationwide survey was conducted among 1,200 respondents and has a three percent margin of error, the article also said.

None of the progressive, grassroots or so-called opposition candidates came even close to the so-called Magic 12.

Filipinos prefer to vote for those who’ve been “tried and tested.” But what track record do our trapos have?

The responsibility of a senator is huge – creating bills, resolutions, conducting inquiries in aid of legislation and trying cases of impeachment, among others.

Every action or inaction will affect our country, our people.

What we really need are senators who are sincere and brilliant enough to help steer our country toward a better future; toward a society that will do away with the exploitation of man and reset the rhythm of our nation. We need men and women who are not driven by greed, lust, power or ambition.

We need to bring statesmen back to our chambers. We needed them yesterday and we need them more tomorrow.

As we go out and vote in May, may we remember the difference between a politician and a statesman, as wisely defined by the American theologian and author James Freeman Clark:

“A politician thinks about the next election while the statesman thinks about the next generation.”",0
35,Iris Gonzales,"Let me tell you about a man long gone but never forgotten.

He was one of those gentlemen from the old school, as rare today as fragments of the moon.

Let me tell you about his life, because it’s worth emulating, a much needed reminder especially in these challenging times that a life lived with purpose and honor is the kind of life we should all aspire for.

He was Jorge Gonzales, an esteemed lawyer, honorable public servant, successful builder and a prolific writer. He was, to put it simply, a Renaissance man who served his family, his country and his fellowmen well, and I am proud to be his granddaughter.

I rarely write about my personal life or my loved ones but allow me this moment to honor my paternal grandfather because days ago, within the august halls of the Goldenberg Mansion inside the Malacañang complex in Manila, the Upsilon Sigma Phi of the University of the Philippines honored his life and his work.

My grandfather was awarded the Upsilonian Noble and Outstanding (UNO) award, the highest distinction given by the Fraternity to its members.

Says the Upsilon in its citation:
“Jorge Gonzales embodied resilience and leadership during some of the most challenging periods in Philippine history. As an active member of Upsilon Sigma Phi during World War II, Gonzales nurtured fraternity unity and strength. He was instrumental in recruiting members who shared Upsilon’s ideals, ensuring its survival and growth during turbulent times.

“In his post-war efforts, Gonzales revitalized the fraternity and inspired younger generations to uphold the fraternity’s values. His career as associate editor of the Philippine Collegian showcased his dedication to ethical journalism, while his work in affordable housing initiatives reflected his commitment to improving the lives of others. His mentorship and advocacy left a lasting imprint on the fraternity and the nation.”

Of love and war
Born in Sigma, Capiz on July 27, 1919, Jorge was the eldest among a brood of seven children.

He hailed from a middle-class family but the hardships of life were not lost on him as he was born in an epoch characterized by one war after another – from World War I to World War II.

He knew early on the importance of hard work, courage, justice and, most of all, service to his fellowmen and country.

All throughout the war years, Jorge, like the rest of the student population, was forced to stop schooling.

But Jorge, as a young adult, responded to the spirit of the times. He thought of ways to help his country and his fellow Filipinos win the war.

Quietly and courageously, and at the risk of his own life, he helped guerrillas while working as a shoe shine boy in the streets of Manila. He eavesdropped on his clients while he quietly cleaned their shoes and made a mental note of whatever information he could gather about the ongoing war.

He would then pass this on to the guerrilla fighters to help them in their battle.

In 1958, president Carlos Garcia, who was known for his “Filipino First” policy, appointed him to Napocor where he later became chief legal counsel, tasked with scrutinizing contracts to make sure that taxpayers’ money did not go to waste. He served Napocor for 20 years, retiring in December 1978 at the age of 60.

In his sunset years, Jorge never really retired. He remained generous with his time, talent and skills.

He put up a build-and-sell business focused on low-cost homes, enabling young families to afford their own house and lot while also providing employment for dozens of construction workers.

Aside from his accomplishments, he was also a very kind man, a loving family patriarch and a proud husband to my grandmother, Belen, a former English professor at UP.

As a grandfather, he grabbed every opportunity to teach us, his grandchildren, about the ways of the world and the importance of always doing what is right.

But I remember him, most of all, as a man with a big heart for others, always seeking ways to help those who had less in life.

He was noble and outstanding, indeed, and also so much more. I may have only 25 percent of his chromosomes but I’d take that any day.

Thank you, Upsilon, for the honor bestowed on Jorge Gonzales. Our family is also grateful to Ambassador Jesus Yabes ’66 and Bill Agustin ’58, chairman of the UNO search committee, for believing in our beloved patriarch.

The only other posthumous awardee was Ferdinand Marcos Sr. President BBM received the award on behalf of the First Family. Former first lady Imelda Marcos and daughter Irene Marcos-Araneta also graced the awarding ceremony held last Feb. 8.

Other UNO awardees are:
Romy Carlos ’63, a celebrated artist; Ernesto de Castro ’64, a notable figure in civil and structural engineering; Steven Mascardo Yuvienco ’67, founding chairman and later president of Upsilon Sigma Phi North America; Renato Tayag Jr. ’67, an environmentalist; Jesus Crispin Remulla ’79, Secretary of Justice; Robert Lester Aranton ’81, UP Alumni Regent and current president of the UP Alumni Association; Romeo Thaddeus Liamzon Jr. ’81, a visionary in real estate development; Fernando Sanchez Jr. ‘84, former Chancellor of UPLB; Ferdinand Martin Romualdez ’85, Speaker of the House of Representatives; Alan Gerard Austriaco ’86; a respected ophthalmologist and Cary Landingin Calimlim ‘93, a veterinarian and entrepreneur.",0
36,Iris Gonzales,"They’re used for a few hours of wild sex, love and even death, but rarely for a good night’s rest or an afternoon siesta.

Whichever one’s purpose is, motels remain resilient in the Philippines, signaling a strong recovery after the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Business is busiest on Valentine’s Day and the days before and after.

A worker in a motel told The STAR that Valentine’s Day, Feb. 14, is reserved for legitimate partners or spouses while Feb. 13 and Feb. 15 are for their paramours.

With their thick walls, mirrors on the ceiling, the privacy they offer and a wide array of themed rooms – Taylor Swift Eras Tour room, anyone? – motels in the country have been the setting for some of the most passionate lovemaking or just hot, sweaty sex.

Motels, whose name originates from the 1925 motor hotel or a hotel for motorists called the Milestone MoTel in California, are mostly for travelers in the United States. It’s a type of hotel with no central lobby and each room is accessed from its own private garage.

In the Philippines, however, this so-called drive-in feature – direct access to rooms from a parking area with a rolling garage door that closes in seconds the moment guests park – provides the privacy some of the forbidden lovers so badly need.

Indeed, according to past surveys, seven out of 10 couples who check into a motel are illicit lovers, among the biggest ironies in this predominantly Catholic country with a history of 500 years of Christianity.

One can’t help but wonder why divorce continues to be met with stiff opposition in Congress despite the prevalence of illicit affairs.

Because of the unique proposition they offer, motels in the Philippines remain resilient and continue to thrive.

Around Metro Manila, the famous motel strips – Malate, Sta. Mesa, Pasig – are still where they have always been, even as property developers have long been eyeing these prime locations.

New themed rooms
These motels, however, also do their part in keeping up with the times by expanding their product offerings.

Hotel Ava, a rebrand of Victoria Court, said business is still thriving despite being in the industry for decades already.

“Even though we rebranded recently, we have many regular guests who keep coming back to us for the price, experience and service,” Erika Christine Balanon, marketing manager of Hotel Ava, told The STAR in an interview.

There are also many motel “virgins” or first-time motel goers, who drive the market.

“The curiosity to try a motel is still there, as we continue to attract many new guests who are first-time motel goers.”

Hotel Ava, which rebranded more than 300 Victoria Court rooms, constantly innovates its products. Led by CEO Angie King, Hotel Ava is a rebrand of Victoria Court motels in Malate, Cuneta and Gil Puyat.

The rest of the Victoria Court properties, which still use the original name, are headed by Angie’s brother Atticus.

“Every year, we strive to offer new themed rooms to the  market that we know our guests will love. For example, we have an Eras Tour-inspired room, complete with a karaoke machine where Swiftie guests can sing their favorite Taylor Swift songs,” Balanon said.

Another popular themed room is the King’s Garage for car enthusiasts and inspired by Angie’s passion for cars.

The King’s Garage features a refurbished car as a bed.

“Our Marvel and Star Wars-inspired rooms are still available to those who want to fulfill their superhero fantasies,” she said, adding that each room is designed to give guests a unique experience.

Through the decades, the biggest market of motels is still couples looking for a romantic and quick stay.

But Hotel Ava also attracts groups of friends or barkadas looking for a private party space, to celebrate a birthday, a bachelor or a bachelorette party or just a karaoke night.

Focus on sustainability
As a business, Hotel Ava also focuses on sustainability.

“In addition to these, we also have sustainability projects that we believe will help the community and make our operations more efficient for our guests. Our employees are also sent to various training programs to improve their skills and better serve our guests,” Balanon said.

The motels business, indeed, continues to thrive, despite the times, despite inflation and despite the elevated prices of goods.

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority’s 2022 Annual Survey of Philippine Business and Industry published in September last year, revenue from short term accommodations which include motels amounted to P110.85 billion in 2022, from P66.12 billion in 2021. The PSA defines this class as hotels, motels, resort hotels, condotels, inns, guesthouses and youth hostels.

But it’s not all about love and sex in motels.

In some of the cheaper motels, abortionists perform abortions to those in need, despite the practice being illegal in the country; some journalists who need to interview a source or a key witness do it in motels, together with their recorders or camera. In the past, there were police interrogations too in these dingy rooms.

Unfortunately, in some instances, there are also suicides.

Once upon a time, in January 1986, a 21-year old “checked into a downtown motel, ordered a beer and then fired a bullet into his temple, according to a Reuters report published on May 21, 1989.

“We learned later it was his birthday and he and his sweetheart had quarreled,” the report quoted a waiter in the motel as saying.",0
37,Iris Gonzales,"There are a lot of things and services that many of our unfortunate fellow Filipinos do not have access to – from quality education to proper health care.

As is usually the case, they are able to avail themselves of these social services but in poor quality – from expired vaccines in barangay health centers to classrooms that leak when the rains come. If the problem isn’t expired vaccines, there are many others – a lack of qualified barangay health workers, ill-equipped centers and government hospitals.

It’s also not uncommon to see classes being held in ankle-deep floods in some parts of our country – both teachers and young boys and girls, carrying on with the lessons despite the flooding. When there is no rain, the problems include crowded classrooms, lack of facilities and supplies, a shortage of qualified teachers and many more. Many of these problems are in the EDCOM II report.

All these inadequacies strip Filipinos of the dignity they deserve. Each of us deserves to live a dignified life.

Dignity is the state or quality of being worthy of honor or respect. This means that as citizens, we must be accorded the social services which the Constitution mandates us to have with honor and respect. This includes the right to dignified education and health care.

One of my first assignments as a rookie journalist was to cover a cancer-stricken man who was dying in a hospital room in a government hospital in Quezon City. The room had seen better days. I remember noticing the broken windows, the dilapidated bed and the miserable charity ward. At the center of it all was the 69-year-old patient who was wasting away, waiting for death to come.

My story was published on Nov. 12, 1999. I’m sure that government hospital has had little improvement, if any, especially with the chronic underfunding of our health budget.

Here in our country, our leaders care very little about dignity, if it’s even on their mind.

If they did, they wouldn’t let our children study in classrooms that aren’t decent or conducive enough to learning. In some far-flung villages in the country, we let them walk miles and miles to school, often in worn-out shoes, because believe it or not, some areas still can’t be reached by vehicles. This is no thanks to local executives and lawmakers who steal the money meant for these roads.

If they did, they wouldn’t allow our people to get health care in hospitals that have seen better days – hospitals where you might get sicker than better because their facilities are dilapidated, worn-out and ill-equipped to handle the latest medical needs.

If they did, they wouldn’t let our people find shelter in the sidewalks or dark nooks and crannies of Metro Manila or in hodgepodge makeshift homes in maze-like slums that are teeming with poverty. They wouldn’t let them relocate in areas so far from civilization, when developers have bulldozed their shanties to make way for condos and resorts.

If they did, they wouldn’t allow them to walk along dizzying and elevated walkways along EDSA just to get to the train station or to cross to the other side for a bus ride home.

And do you remember the Dolomite Beach along Manila Bay?

That for me was one concrete example of government action that stripped citizens of dignity.

Sure, that fake white sand beach was beautiful but it was merely opium, with a nearly P400-million tab. It was a distraction, like barbiturates in our veins to make us forget what we really needed at the time when that magically appeared. That was during the COVID-19 pandemic and Filipinos, facing growing anxiety and mental health problems, were looking for concrete solutions.

But that was nothing but a band-aid solution. The masses were fooled into believing they could finally enjoy a stroll on the beach and experience white sand between their toes. But that was not even the real thing. It was dolomite. Our leaders couldn’t even give them a real beach.

Where’s the dignity in that?

The Kantian platitude
The early modern concept of dignity, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, originates with Immanuel Kant, who in his 1785 Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, argued that all persons have an inherent value, or dignity by virtue of their rational autonomy.

This value commands a distinct kind of moral respect, which we express by abiding by certain limits in our treatment of others. Thus, Kant argued that we have a categorical duty to treat persons always “as an end” and “never merely as a means.”

In more recent decades, the United Nations formally established inherent dignity in the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights, affirming the “inherent dignity” and “equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family” as the “foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.”

I think about dignity now because the campaign period has officially commenced. And as in previous elections, our people will be promised the moon and the stars, and kisses all they want.

They may be given kilos of rice and a few cans of sardines or packs of noodles for their crucial votes but we, the people, deserve so much more than that.

We need housing, education, public health and employment. But most of all, we need leaders who will treat Filipinos with dignity – not as crucial votes to be bought with a few pesos and a song.",0
38,Iris Gonzales,"Remember that day when what seemed impossible happened? On Sept. 16, 1991, history unfolded in the Philippine Senate.

The chamber unexpectedly voted against the proposed US bases treaty, which would have given the US another 10 years to maintain its military presence at Subic Naval Base in the Philippines.

It was a historic vote, decided by a slim 12-11 margin. The 12 senators, who would later be known as the “Magnificent Twelve,” were Agapito “Butz” Aquino, Joseph Estrada, Teofisto Guingona Jr., Sotero Laurel II, Ernesto Maceda, Orlando Mercado, Aquilino Pimentel Jr., Rene Saguisag, Jovito Salonga, Wigberto Tañada, Victor Ziga and Juan Ponce Enrile.

These men put aside their personal biases and voted for the nation’s interest. Some of them were statesmen through and through.

That decision put an end to the US military bases in the country, which were considered a big part of our colonial past.

Shining moment
I think about this chamber’s defining hour back then. From the Senate that said “no” in 1991 for nationalist reasons, we now have a Senate that also said “no” to the impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte – but clearly not for nationalist reasons. Perhaps this is more about political interest.

For many, the Senate’s decision not to act immediately on the VP’s impeachment was a complete disappointment.

We saw the crowd that gathered last month at EDSA, calling for VP Duterte’s impeachment. Sure, it wasn’t anything like EDSA I or II, but there was a big crowd nonetheless.

A December 2024 survey conducted by Social Weather Stations showed that 41 percent of Filipinos support Duterte’s impeachment. Some 35 percent were opposed and 19 percent were undecided. The survey, conducted from Dec. 12 to 18, involved 2,160 respondents and has a margin of error of ±2.

Among socio-economic classes, support for impeachment is strongest in Classes ABC, where 50 percent agree with the impeachment complaint, according to Stratbase.

This isn’t surprising, given the revelations surrounding the VP, including the use of confidential funds and, after the hearings, her threats of violence.

What happens next?
The Senate has adjourned and will resume on June 2, by which time a new set of 12 senators will have been elected.

Against this backdrop, there’s no telling how things will unfold.

Senate President Francis Escudero has been firm in saying that the chamber cannot be rushed. He also said the Constitution’s provision on impeachment does not use the word “immediately” but “forthwith.”

Says the Constitution: “…and trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed.”

But what does “forthwith” mean? In the dictionary, it means “immediately, without delay,” especially in official use.

Maybe it would be better for the Senate President to just say that the Senate chooses not to proceed yet, even if it can.

There’s a lot at stake, after all. Perhaps the senators are well aware that this is a slippery slope they don’t want to navigate right now.

There are quite a number of pro-Duterte senators in the chamber, and some re-electionists also want to be spared from the consequences of their decision.

Perhaps this is also a matter of horse-trading. Senator Chiz wants to spare the senators from being put in a tight spot, a leverage he can later use in winning his colleagues’ support in his bid to retain the Senate presidency after the polls.

Politics, after all, is a game of compromises.

In the end, however, the Senate – under Senate President Escudero’s leadership – will have to answer to the people.

Whatever happened to the Senate as an institution? Has it become a spineless chamber?

In the past, the Senate has delivered bold decisions that once seemed impossible. Senators of decades past were true statesmen who prioritized the public good over their own interests.

Even former senator Leila de Lima reminded her former colleagues that the Senate can function as an impeachment court even outside of regular sessions.

“Kahit walang regular session kasi yung impeachment, hindi ito yung ordinary legislative function ng Kongreso. Ito ay isang non-legislative function, special function ng Kongreso,” De Lima said in an interview with TeleRadyo.

The former senator also said that Congress has done its part, and it is now up to the Senate to continue the process.

She also said that the Senate constituting itself as an impeachment court is an “obligation” imposed by the Constitution.

Former senator Franklin Drilon was likewise quoted as saying that a special session is necessary to start the process.

Even retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio said President Marcos can call a special session for the impeachment trial. He also said that while waiting, plunder charges could be filed against the VP.

For now, we’ll have to wait and see what happens next.

What is certain is that the VP was impeached by 215 congressmen, acting on complaints that were based on the findings of the hearings and public statements Duterte herself made.

With or without an impeachment trial, the VP must address the issues raised against her, especially because taxpayers’ money is involved.",0
39,Iris Gonzales,"It’s been two years since the death of tycoon Roberto V. Ongpin or RVO, who died in 2023, cradled in the arms of his beloved Balesin.

On Wednesday, Feb. 5, there was a memorial mass commemorating his second death anniversary at Alphaland Makati Place which, just like Balesin, is among his well-loved projects.

Unfortunately, I was out of town that day so I missed the event. I am usually away on Feb. 5 because that day happens to be a loved one’s birthday. In fact, when I heard the news of his death that cold February morning in 2023, I was in Baguio, supposedly celebrating a happy time. But I remembered being really stunned and sad when I heard the news of his passing that early morning. That moment, Baguio’s weather just became colder. RVO, to me, was not just a good and brilliant source but a friend with a great sense of humor.

Last week, I was in Cavite and could not be there for his mass. RVO would not have taken no for an answer. I imagine him, pestering me from the grave with his stern voice: “Hey, come back to Manila now and attend my memorial mass!”

That’s RVO. He was personal like that. He would call people or write to us himself when he wanted to share something or needed something. Or sometimes, he simply wanted to invite us over to share some of his finest drinks or good food and talk about the crazy political environment in our country.

He knew a lot about the country and played a big role in our society during nearly every pivotal chapter – from Marcos Sr. to Marcos Jr.

Before he died, he wrote his memoirs, but as he told me before, it would only be published after he had kicked the bucket and perhaps, when some people he wrote about had too. Let’s wait and see.

I may have missed his memorial mass but RVO is always in my thoughts and prayers. When our political environment gets crazier, I often wonder what he would have said. Just like now, would he have supported the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte? Or would he have tried to stop it? He had friends in Congress. Would he have persuaded them to do this or that? What would he say to his friend –(or protégé?) Senate President Chiz Escudero?

RVO was a quiet power player, even without trying. He was a man who knew his worth.

At some point, as Marcos Sr.’s trade minister, he had a good vision for the country, identifying local industries we needed to develop. Had RVO’s vision come to life, we would be first world now and better equipped to face today’s trade challenges. Cronyism and politics, sadly, got in the way.

His Binondo Central Bank helped save the economy at a crucial time. His businesses, now helmed by his nephew Eric Recto, remain an important part of the country’s business landscape.

RVO, “unretirable” as he was, would have wanted to do more.

But he did what he could during his time on earth, and boy, did he enjoy it, too. His legacy lives on and will not be forgotten.

Populist
Speaking of Congress, traders are urging our lawmakers to reconsider the proposed P200 daily wage hike.

Businessmen from the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc. (FFCCCII) said that while they recognize the need for meaningful wage adjustments to help workers cope with rising costs of living, they also hope that the proposal considers the welfare of businesses and the economy as a whole.

Instead of a legislated wage hike, wage-setting should consider regional conditions, FFCCCII said.

“Rather than a blanket nationwide wage increase, wage-setting should consider regional economic conditions. The cost of living varies significantly across the country, and a uniform P200 hike may disproportionately affect businesses in lower-cost regions, leading to closures and job losses.

“Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards composed of labor, business and government representatives are in the best position to determine fair and sustainable wage adjustments based on local realities,” according to FFCCCII president Dr. Cecilio Pedro.

Economic realities
I also talked to other businesses, especially the smaller ones, and they, too, raised concerns on a legislated wage increase.

“At a time of global economic volatility and high borrowing costs, imposing a drastic wage hike could worsen economic conditions. A P200 increase could trigger higher prices, job cuts or business closures – hitting hardest the 84 percent of workers in the informal sector.

“If wages rise too high unilaterally and too drastically, we, the businesses here in the Philippines, might lose our global competitiveness... More MSMEs might suffer and many workers may even face retrenchment.”

Progressive lawmakers will dismiss this as selfish business interests but our present-day realities would show that indeed, small businesses will definitely be hurt from a P200 daily wage hike.

This isn’t surprising though, given that it’s election season and our lawmakers tend to embrace populist moves.

An increase in wages is surely justified but the amount must take into consideration all stakeholders.

The FFCCCII said there must be a balance in safeguarding workers’ welfare and business viability.

“As our 70th anniversary slogan states: ‘Dugong Tsino, Pusong Pinoy’ – we seek to uplift workers’ lives while safeguarding business viability and Philippine economic resilience.”",0
40,Iris Gonzales,"Did you know that many of our Filipino youth are dropping out of college and instead opting to earn a living right away for their families?

It’s even worse in Mindanao, with higher education attrition rates reaching as high as 93.4 percent recorded in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

This is as alarming as it can get, and it’s among the disturbing findings of the Second Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM II), a national commission tasked with evaluating the performance of the Philippine education sector.

I’ve always believed that education is a step toward building a better future for oneself and one’s country. Education opens doors and opportunities, and each and every Filipino must have access to it.

The right education can help lift families out of poverty; we’ve seen success stories of some of the country’s tycoons who were products of state universities or were given scholarships to private schools.

Education can spell the difference between surviving and thriving. And yet, it’s not just that. It’s about experiencing the joys of learning, which are magical, cathartic and beautiful.

Sadly, many of today’s youth won’t get a chance at that because poverty is forcing them out of college. Many of them have to be breadwinners early in life to send their young siblings to school because their parents’ earnings aren’t enough.

It is a cultural and economic problem.

Says EDCOM II:

“While higher education participation rate in the country is high at 34.89 percent, this remains lower than the ASEAN average of 41.10 percent. This also varies significantly across regions, with BARMM (18.7 percent), Bicol (24.6 percent) and Central Luzon (25.1 percent) having much lower rates.

“Studies find that the top deterrents to pursuing higher education today are employment/looking for work (44.17 percent), lack of personal interest (24.94 percent) and financial limitations (20.98 percent).”

Likewise, the attrition rates are equally disturbing.

“Higher education attrition rates are alarmingly high: at 39 percent nationally but reaching 93.4 percent in BARMM, followed by Region VII (60.7 percent), Region IX (59.5 percent) and CAR (54.9 percent).”

What to do then?

EDCOM II underscores the need for CHED to closely monitor and understand the factors contributing to severe dropouts and to initiate programs to address attrition.

Free higher education in state universities and colleges and local universities and colleges has improved participation, although I personally believe that government interventions must be targeted instead of a free-for-all setup where rich kids end up crowding out the poorest of the poor in some state universities.

DSWD data show at least 683,822 college-eligible students from Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program families could benefit from the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES).

However, reductions in TES – to P10,000 from P60,000 – may push the poorest students out of college, affect student completion rates and limit program choices.

EDCOM II warns that this may force the poorest students to forego higher education. Further, it would only realistically allow them to choose from five courses on average, most of which are already oversubscribed. These include Elementary Education, Technology and Livelihood Education, Criminology, Industrial Technology and Technical Education.

Thus, EDCOM II recommends restoring the original subsidy of P60,000 for TES grantees to support successful completion.

It also recommends providing additional incentives for those pursuing government-identified priority programs.

Teacher education
Another problematic area, as pointed out by EDCOM II, is the inadequate education that teachers receive.

Did you know that 62 percent of high school teachers are teaching subjects outside their college major?

“This misalignment between pre-service training and school-level needs undermines the quality of instructional expertise in the basic education system,” according to the report.

Not surprisingly, the mismatch is more pronounced in the sciences.

“The problem is particularly pronounced in the sciences, with a 98 percent mismatch in the physical sciences and an 80 percent mismatch in the biological sciences, highlighting a critical gap in subject-specific expertise.”

Furthermore, 13 percent and 16 percent of science teachers, respectively, teach science outside their specialization.

The teacher education curriculum requires only a minimum of six units each for field studies and practice teaching, which is among the shortest practice teaching requirements in the world.

I’m not sure when or how we got into this situation.

But one thing is certain – we need to act fast to arrest this decline.

The Department of Education must revisit teacher quality and training.

Teachers’ salaries
It is also time to raise the salary of teachers and create a system where there is room for career advancement.

“It takes teachers 15 years to move from Teacher 1 (Salary Grade 11 at P27,000) to Teacher 3 (Salary Grade 13 at P31,320),” EDCOM II said.

As it is now, teachers move to administrative roles for higher pay, further reducing the presence of experienced educators in classrooms.

A great teacher can spell the difference between success and failure in life. The least we can do for our children is to ensure that they get the best teachers.

From teachers to classroom shortages to rising incidence of college dropouts and many other problems in between, there is no doubt that our crisis in education is a ticking time bomb.

This crisis is a testament to what happens when taxpayers’ money meant for education is corrupted with impunity.",0
41,Maria A. Ressa,"Those with power and money must choose. Ask yourselves these questions: Who are you? What do you stand for? What kind of world do you want in the next decade?'
The following speech was delivered by Rappler CEO Maria Ressa on Sunday, May 2, after receiving the 2021 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.

Thank you so much to UNESCO, the independent jury, the more than 80 press freedom and news organizations who have helped us hold the line. This is for Rappler and all Filipino journalists who – despite the increased risks just to be able to do our jobs – continue to hold power to account. It’s also a reflection of how the world looks at the Duterte administration today and the death by a thousand cuts of our democracy happening in front of our eyes.

I wish I were with you today in Namibia, but I’m in Manila, prevented from traveling by court order – which I continue to fight as State-led legal attacks are waged against me on multiple fronts. I also can’t travel because my nation is suffering the consequences of putting retired military generals in charge of a public health crisis – when political patronage and loyalty, not competence, is the metric of power.

This is a time when lies and incompetence kill.

In less than two years, the Philippine government filed 10 arrest warrants against me.

In 2017, government propagandists tried to trend the hashtag #ArrestMariaRessa. They failed, but they kept at it, and two years later, I was arrested – twice – in a little more than a month. They violated my rights when they prevented me from posting bail and detained me overnight. I suppose they wanted me to shake and feel their power.

To the budding dictators of this world, if you have to abuse your power to make you feel powerful, you’re not powerful – just abusive and small.

What I and other truth-tellers in the Philippines have lived through has given us firsthand experience of how the law and law enforcement have been turned against our people. Now more than ever, power and money rule.

In 2016, 4 months after Duterte became president, Rappler and I wrote investigative pieces showing you how the first casualty in our nation’s battle for truth is the number of people killed in our brutal drug war. That violence was facilitated and fueled by American social media companies. Based on big data analysis, we reported the networks that were manipulating us online, targeting and attacking truth-tellers, pounding to silence anyone challenging power, which created an extensive social media propaganda machine.

Five years ago, we demanded an end to impunity on two fronts: Duterte’s drug war and Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook. Today, it has only gotten worse – and Silicon Valley’s sins came home to roost on January 6 with mob violence on Capitol Hill.

What happens on social media doesn’t stay on social media.

Online violence leads to real world violence.

Since 2016, I have felt like Sisyphus and Cassandra combined, repeatedly warning that our dystopian present is your future. American biologist EO Wilson said it best: we’re facing paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology.

Social media, with its highly profitable micro targeting, has become a behavior modification system, and we are Pavlov’s dogs experimented on in real time – with disastrous consequences. Facebook is the world’s largest distributor of news, and yet studies have shown that lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and further than really boring facts. The social media platforms that deliver the facts to you are biased against facts, biased against journalists, biased against meaningful conversations. They are – by design – dividing us and radicalizing us. This is not a free speech issue. It’s not the fault of its users. These platforms are not merely mirroring humanity. They are making all of us our worst selves, creating emergent behavior that feeds on violence, fear, uncertainty, and enabling the rise of fascism.

Think of it like this.

Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without trust, we have no shared reality, and it becomes impossible to deal with our world’s existential problems: the coronavirus, climate, the atom bomb that exploded in our information ecosystem when journalists lost gatekeeping powers to technology companies. Tech abdicated responsibility for the public sphere and couldn’t seem to fathom that information is a public good.

Women, people of color, the LGBTQ, those already marginalized become even more vulnerable as you’ll see in the UNESCO report “The Chilling” whose lead author, ICFJ’s Julie Posetti, convinced me to speak up when my attacks began many years ago. Of course, there’s a cost to speaking truth to power.

On Christmas Eve two years ago, Amal Clooney sent me an email. Until then, no one had really had the time to go through the many ludicrous charges I’m facing and their penalties. Turns out I could go to jail for the rest of my life. By her last count – on paper – it was more than a hundred years in prison. So I dealt with the sinking feeling in my stomach – this is my lawyer telling me that, right? I took away a lesson: don’t open an email from Amal on Christmas Eve! Sometimes you just have to laugh.

Believe it or not, I’m lucky. When you’re the target of attacks you’re the only one who sees it all, but you can also see exactly how the tactics change. Knowledge is power. And because I spent two decades of my career outside the Philippines, the international community knows me, the quality of my work, my values, my work ethic.

So many others aren’t so lucky.

Like 35-year-old Ritchie Nepomuceno, who accused the police of extortion, torture, and rape. She was one of at least 3 Filipino women who filed charges against 11 policemen who they said held them inside a secret room at a police station. Less than two weeks ago on April 19, Ritchie was walking down the street when she was shot and killed.

Human rights activist Zara Alvarez and another colleague were set to testify against the government and the military. She went as far as asking for court protection, which was at first denied, and is still on appeal. Last August, she was walking home with her dinner – she had just bought it – when she was shot and killed. So was her colleague. No one is left to testify. I could go on.

Now let’s go to the journalists.

Frenchie Mae Cumpio, still in jail, celebrated her 22nd birthday in prison. Arrested and jailed more than a year ago, it is a familiar tactic: get an arrest warrant; do a raid; then charge with possession of illegal firearms and explosives, a non-bailable offense.

That’s also what happened to Lady Ann Salem, another young journalist. Arrested last December, Salem said the police planted evidence in her apartment, but another judge voided her arrest warrant. It still took time before she was released, forcing her to spend 3 months in prison during a pandemic. 

Because she’s a journalist.

It’s not a coincidence that these victims are women. This February, Senator Leila de Lima, whom Amnesty International calls a prisoner of conscience, began her 5th year in prison. She calls it lawfare – when law is used as a weapon to silence anyone questioning power. The cuts to democracy are bleeding. They’re overwhelming and can’t be ignored.

Last year, two days, just two days after World Press Freedom Day, Filipino lawmakers, nudged by President Duterte, shut down ABS-CBN, once our largest broadcasting network, our largest news group, also headed by a female journalist. Thousands lost their jobs.

Around the same time that Hong Kong passed its draconian security law, the Philippines passed an anti-terror law that sparked 37 petitions at the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional. Under that law, anyone some Cabinet secretaries call a terrorist could be arrested without a warrant and jailed for up to 24 days. Here’s one last fact: more lawyers have died under the Duterte administration than in the 44 years before he took office.

So here’s the thing: our problems can’t be solved from the Philippines alone. Again, something I’ve said repeatedly: what’s local is global; and what’s global is local.

As we face the coronavirus, there’s an equally dangerous and insidious virus of lies unleashed in our information ecosystem. It’s seeded by power wanting to stay in power, spread by algorithms motivated, created for profit, a business model Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. The reward is your attention, and all this is linked to geopolitical power play. Last week, the EU slammed Russia and China for their intensified vaccine disinformation campaigns. Last September, Facebook took down information operations from China that were campaigning for the daughter of Duterte for president – next year, our presidential elections – that network was creating fake accounts for US elections, and it was attacking me.

The virus of lies is highly contagious. They infect real people, who become impervious to facts. It changes the way they look at the world. They become angrier, more isolated. They distrust everything.

In this environment, the dictator wins, crumbling our democracies from within.

I became a journalist 35 years ago when people power in the Philippines helped spark democracy movements around the world. I had the great privilege of reporting on much of Southeast Asia’s transition from one-man authoritarian rule to democracy. 

Inevitably, there is this one moment when power and money chooses – status quo or change: in the Philippines in 1986, it was an elite family’s banner at a protest rally that helped open the floodgates that ousted a dictator. In Indonesia in 1998, months of student protests led nowhere until the business community and the military stepped in, ending nearly 32 years of Suharto.

Those with power and money must choose.

Ask yourselves these questions: Who are you? What do you stand for? What kind of world do you want in the next decade?

The more you have, the more you must risk.

Because silence is complicity.

Whether you’re at the UN or heading a nation or a corporation, or you’re a politician, human rights worker, a journalist, or a citizen, fight – and win – your individual battle for integrity.

At stake is our collective global future.

Please act now.

Courage ON. Thank you.",0
42,Maria A. Ressa,"He calls his protocol 'SDS' – sanitize, disinfect, sterilize
Business owners have to put their people – and their customers – first. 

Going to get a haircut in our science-fiction world can be an adventure, but when I walked into the Basement Salon at SM Aura, I had a new appreciation for details – noticing how the pens were individually sterilized, the counter top wiped down with Clorox sheets, and how contact tracing was automated with each of us getting a pre-printed sheet with our name on it.

I couldn’t help but ask the owner/manager Michael Webb about his systems, and we compared notes. 

We at Rappler have been extra cautious, putting in place protocols and systems, digging into research, estimating costs. Last March, we began to keep an Excel spreadsheet of everyone’s temperatures, with our managers checking their teams and families. 

I do love learning about how to adapt, and I think Michael’s journey and choices give us a path forward. He came home to help his family business, leaving behind a VP post with a semiconductor company in the US. Those corporate processes and thinking helped infuse his choices, but it’s inevitably his values that dictated his path. 

Working in California, Michael was steeped in the HIV battle and in legislation that was introduced by his father, former senator Freddie Webb. Since a salon is a high contact business, Michael put in place systems to deal with HIV and hepatitis. He said it was only a hop-skip-and-a-jump to use those systems for COVID-19. Looking at his software, he showed how he could go back 3-4 years and know exactly which staff members interacted with each customer.

As I was getting my haircut, I saw that he had separated us into clusters, with staff moving from customers in a systematic manner. Again, easier for contact tracing!

Some highlights from our chat below:

Webb describes 3 protocols he put in place for HIV and hepatitis, which he has adapted to the coronavirus: “There are 3 basic hygiene protocols. The first is you sanitize, which is cleaning. Then you introduce another product, which is a disinfectant. Then the third one is when you render an object inert, which is when you sterilize.” 
Every tool used by his staffers are divided into 3 categories: non-critical, semi-critical, critical: “The ones that are critical are defined as those having a higher percentage of actually piercing skin.”
He calls his protocol “SDS” – sanitize, disinfect, sterilize.
Instead of wearing full PPEs, his staffers wear cotton lab coats. The salon has a steamer, and after each customer, the staffer’s outer garments are steamed, a more effective way, Webb said studies show, than keeping one plastic PPE in place all day.
Webb follows the findings for disinfectants of the US Environmental Protection Agency. He gives us some of what he’s found, including what disinfectants he uses and where.
For his staff, it’s a constant education. Keeping them updated about what he reads, his processes. He also has in place a testing process for his staff, and always emphasizes that the best way is to be aware of where they go and what they do. 
While his salon is ready for Christmas, he says he is preparing for New Year’s Eve, and he shares some of the processes he is thinking about adapting, given that he cannot control all the moves of his staff during the holidays. 

So for him, that most likely means increased testing. He drops a tidbit: the best time to test is 3 days after a potential infection. 

Watch our conversation here.

I asked him about advice he would give to families for the holidays, and he was categorical: 1) Wear a mask and a face shield; 2) Be careful. Avoid going out if you don’t have to. If you want to go to a restaurant, order in; 3) Be hygienic, but avoid overkill at home. 

To Webb, it is about knowing and understanding the coronavirus, and accepting that you have a responsibility not only to yourself and your family, but to your neighbors too.

“I am responsible for my clients and my people. That’s how I feel,” said Webb. “I don’t want to look back and say, ‘I should have, you know, I could have…’ I would rather say, ‘I did the best I could.’”",0
43,Maria A. Ressa,"Information operations are manipulating Filipinos online, but finally, Facebook is doing something to stop that
 

Editor’s Note: The original version of this piece was commissioned and first published online by Time Magazine on January 17, 2019, as part of its series on Facebook and its global impact. This is reposted with permission. 

For a time, my reputation – and peace of mind – was demolished by information operations on Facebook. It’s a cautionary tale for the United States.

I run Rappler, an online news site in the Philippines. In my country, Facebook essentially is the internet, thanks to subsidies from telecommunications companies that let people avoid data charges while on the site. But it has also made the Philippines a showcase for the destruction Facebook can enable.

The attacks against me and Rappler began appearing on Facebook in the summer of 2016. A year later President Rodrigo Duterte was repeating them in his State of the Nation Address. I have since been indicted on politically-motivated criminal charges, faced my first arrest warrant, and posted bail. Not just once, but 5 times in two separate courts. I need permission to travel outside the Philippines.

If I lose these tax evasion cases and others filed by the Philippine government, I could go to jail for 10 to 15 years.

All because I – and Rappler, the startup I helped create, 7 years old this month – continue to hold power to account, to do our jobs as journalists, and to #HoldTheLine against impunity in a drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people, according to human rights groups.

We know first-hand how social media and the law has been weaponized against perceived critics of the Duterte administration. We’ve been reporting on it from the start. 

In early October 2016, Rappler published a 3-part series on social media propaganda. It analyzed the emerging information ecosystem using what researchers later called “patriotic trolling” – online, state-sponsored hate meant to silence or intimidate specific targets. After the exposé appeared, I received an average of 90 hate messages per hour for the next month. 

The attacks on Facebook are insidious and extremely personal, from the way I look and sound to threats of rape and murder. As a former war zone correspondent, I have been in the line of fire, but nothing prepared me for this.

After all, a lie repeated a million times becomes the truth, shaping and conditioning public opinion, seeding the messages that would be repeated by President Duterte himself: that Rappler is CIA, fake news, owned by Americans, many more. It hits me every time I look back because these lies form the basis of some of the legal cases against us.

This is our daily pressure cooker: attacked from below by cheap armies on social media, and from above by President Duterte and the government.

The effort was extremely well organized. Each of the government propaganda machine’s 3 main content creators addressed a different slice of society: Sass Sasot created pseudo-intellectual content for the top 1%; Thinking Pinoy (RJ Nieto) targeted the middle class; and singer-dancer turned government official now congressional candidate Mocha Uson riled up the mass base. As early as 2016, an #UnfollowRappler campaign activated at least 52,000 accounts. That was about 1% of our followers at that time – but consider that an earlier investigation showed us that 26 fake accounts on Facebook could reach up to 3 million others.

What mayhem could more than 50,000 Facebook accounts create?

They can reverse perceptions, splitting the real world from the social media world.

We saw it happen. In January 2018, the Pew Global Attitudes Survey found 86% of Filipinos out in the physical world said they trusted traditional news media. If you live on social media, though, your perception was nearly the complete opposite: 83% distrusted it, according to the Philippine Trust Index released that same month. It happened from systematic and exponentially growing attacks on traditional media, which clearly escalated after Duterte took office in June 2016. In the year before the election campaign, the language Duterte used to attack the media – bias(ed) and corrupt or “bayaran” – barely registered in Facebook comments or posts. Afterward, bias came up 2,000 times a day, and bayaran one day approached 4,000. (For example in one day, bias had an unnaturally high, boosted peak of 30,000 comments.) The attacks pounded fracture lines in society repeatedly until perception was made reality.  These attacks fuel anger and hate to tear down trust in truth-tellers: journalists, human rights advocates; to maintain high approval ratings for President Duterte; and to change the values of a significant chunk of our society who now say it’s okay to kill drug users or to let China have portions of Philippine territory in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea). The attacks wage war against opposition politicians, manipulate the Filipino public, and weaken our democracy.

Rappler knows the best and the worst of what Facebook can do. As the world’s largest distributor of news, its refusal to act as a true gatekeeper allows lies to spread faster than truth. For that, I’m among Facebook’s worst critics. Yet Rappler’s exponential growth would not have happened without the social media giant.

I know its immense potential for good. That is why we continue to work with Facebook, as one of 3 fact-checking partners in our country, defining facts and looking at networks that spread lies.

I don’t think we have a choice. This is transformative technology, and we can use it to push Facebook to understand its true impact – good and evil – in the world. I’m cautiously optimistic that the good can prevail. On January 11, in its second takedown of “inauthentic” sites and accounts in the Philippines, Facebook banned a significant chunk of the disinformation ecosystem manipulating Filipinos with a link to the Internet Research Agency and the Russian disinformation ecosystem.

Rappler had identified the network, and written about it, nearly 13 months earlier.",0
44,Maria A. Ressa,"Great teachers who shape our values, our sense of right and wrong, will always be with us
Note: To celebrate National Teacher’s Month and Filipino-American History Month, I’d like to share this weekend in July with you. This first appeared in Rappler’s Brave New World newsletter, August 9, 2019. 

It was a weekend that stirred my soul and reminded me of the details that create our lives: jokes with lifelong friends; an orchestra room where I spent hours practicing – and the stage where we performed; the ties that created the person I have become.
 
My family left the Philippines in 1973 and settled in Toms River, New Jersey. My parents commuted nearly 4 hours a day to New York City so that their kids could avoid the inner city schools. Toms River’s public school system gave me free music lessons, computer programming classes, advanced placement classes that allowed us to compete in Ivy league schools, a future that promised you can accomplish anything if you work hard enough.

Everyone has a teacher who helped make them who they are. Mine is Donald Spaulding. I cried when I saw the announcement of his death on April 8, 2019 and contacted his family. His kids are now all grown up with kids of their own, and on July 28, the many people whose lives he touched came together back on the stage where we grew up for his memorial concert. When we arrived in Toms River, I was the short, quiet kid who could barely speak English. Mr. Spaulding nurtured me and others like me: kids looking to belong, looking for our place in the world. I first found that in music, and that became the foundation of student government, basketball, softball, theater, so much more – extra-curricular activities and academics that shaped my world. When I graduated high school, I was voted “Most Likely to Succeed.”

I couldn’t have done all that without Mr. Spaulding. He was not just my violin teacher and orchestra conductor. He helped me learn to play up to 8 different instruments (some not very good). All these experiments in my life – that is because of Don Spaulding, who would pick me up from the other side of town so that I could have a chance to participate in rehearsals and gigs.

Without him, life would have been so different.

But that was only the beginning. He pushed me to be better than I could ever be – as a person and as a musician.

He helped me choose the music for all the auditions he pushed me to do – from the intermediate and high school orchestras in Toms River to the Garden State Youth Orchestra to All State to the Garden State Philharmonic to so many more. Mr. Spaulding heard every soaring note and every mistake, and always pushed me to do better. If you have never auditioned for first violin or concert mistress, you do not know what stress is! All my after school jobs then were music related: as a music counsellor at Camp Discovery to our T.R. Express: a country-western group of orchestra nerds playing the music we heard on the radio.

During Sunday brunches, we were a string quartet, but at night, we just had the best fun ever – earning more than I would have earned at McDonald’s or Dunkin Donuts. We got together because I wanted him to sing “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” – and when we finished figuring that out, we just kept playing – Kansas’ “Dust in the Wind,” Dan Fogelberg’s “Longer,” so many more. I will never forget playing at the Ground Round with the peanuts on the floor, at our local mall, at Six Flags’ Great Adventure … so many more.

We were a fixture at pop concerts – what fun we had! So at the memorial for Mr. Spaulding – after more than 3 decades, I picked up my violin and played in an orchestra again.

Our conductor, Sue Viksne Degoey, chose the lineup from what many of us played under Mr. Spaulding’s baton. I stepped into my high school self with Pachelbel’s Canon, and Keith Kalemba composed an original elegy.

We rehearsed for a little over an hour, and there we were, coming together, playing for the memory of a man we all loved. That weekend reminded me again that no one can accomplish anything meaningful alone.

A day before our concert some of my closest friends decided to meet at sunset at Island Beach State Park, bring food and drinks, and catch up over a bonfire.
 
It was a perfect day: a cool breeze blowing, just enough for us to sit in front of the fire and reminisce. Gigi and I lived around the block from each other and biked around the woods behind our houses. It was fun to deliberately get lost and then find our way home. Then we would save our money, and when we had enough, bike an hour to get a coke and French fries. Over the years, she carried so many science projects for me: an exploding volcano (which almost exploded at the bus stop), a solar oven .. and as she reminded me, my violin, guitar or whatever other instrument I was playing that day. I suppose we also gravitated together because we were brown in a predominantly white neighborhood. But it was something we were never conscious of because then the Philippines was a far, dim memory.

The past, present and the future came together, and I realized the person you are was already formed in high school. We fell into our old roles: Lisa, always the organizer who always thinks of everything; Cary, our Greek-American pragmatist; Larry, the boy-scout who built the bonfire; Ruthie, our marinerette; Yvonne, our basketball center … and my kid sister and cousin, who joked they were now part of the big kids’ table. So what did I learn? 

That an orchestra is a perfect metaphor for a working democracy: the music gives you systems and notes, but how you play, how you feel, how you lead, how you follow – well, that’s all up to you. It reminded me how much I loved being in the swirl of music, one part listening and soaring, another part counting the beats, watching the ups and downs of our bows, always part of you focused on the conductor, ready to follow. Excess within control. 

That great friendships, despite the distance of time and place, get better with age.

And that teachers, the mentors who point you in the right direction, will always be with you. Mr. Spaulding brought me back across the oceans, to relive, to play, to cry. Thank you, Mr. Spaulding, for your generosity of spirit, for helping me fit in, and for reminding me that music flows through our lives and connects all of us.",0
45,Maria A. Ressa,"‘This is an existential moment in time, where, if we don’t take the right steps forward, democracy as we know it is dead’

This is Maria Ressa’s keynote speech delivered to a standing ovation from nearly 2,000 journalists at the 11th Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Hamburg, Germany, on September 28, 2019. 

An attack on one is an attack on all.

The first time I heard that was more than two decades ago, looking at the virulent ideology that powered al-Qaeda. That was what the terrorists used to justify their attacks. Then at a pivotal moment, when I was still just learning to deal with the new weapon against journalists, Julie Posetti, who’s in the audience now, convinced me that I should be speaking about these attacks on social media – and within 24 hours convinced me to do an interview for a book she was working on for Unesco. Its title: An attack on one is an attack on all.

This is an existential moment in time – where, if we don’t take the right steps forward, democracy as we know it is dead.

The more I study this time – which started with technology’s disruption, then attacks against journalists, then democracy – the more I’m convinced that the attacks against us and our values are so insidious that the equivalent of an atomic explosion has ruptured our worlds – and all we do is chip away at the tip of the iceberg we can see. But please keep this in mind as I speak: an attack of massive casualties has occurred – and most of us don’t know about it.

I’ll talk about 3 points tonight: the battle for truth, the role of American social media platforms, and what we can do about it.

When journalists are under attack, democracy is under attack. Social media platforms are now the world’s largest distributor of news, but, while they’ve taken the revenues, they’ve ignored the gatekeeping powers that news groups have traditionally had.

It takes courage to fight back against the insidious manipulation these platforms have enabled. They’re now used as a weapon against journalists – where lies laced with anger and hate spread faster than facts. (Facts are kinda boring.)

This really hit me last December when Time Magazine named me one of the guardians of truth. At that point in time, I realized – among the Capital Gazette (the journalists who were killed there), the Reuters journalists still in prison in Myanmar at the time and Jamal Khashoggi – I was the only one who was both alive and free, making me think that never before has our profession…protecting our democracies…demanded so much from us.

The battle for truth is the battle of our generation. With technology as the accelerant, a lie told a million times becomes a fact.

Without facts, we don’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust. Without all 3, you can’t have democracy. This is why democracy is broken around the world.

In our country, the bottom up exponential attacks on social media astroturfing and creating a bandwagon effect soften the ground before the same lies came top down from our top government officials.

I know this first-hand: in 14 months, the Philippine government filed at least 11 cases and investigations against me and Rappler. I was arrested twice in a 5-week period, and I’ve posted bail 8 times in about 3 months. I have committed no crime except to be a journalist and to hold power to account.

I’ve seen social media and our legal system weaponized against those who ask questions, who stand up for values, who demand the rights guaranteed under our Constitution, which is patterned after the US Constitution.

When I was first arrested early this year, the officer said, “Ma’am, trabaho lang po.” (Ma’am, I’m only doing my job). Then he lowered his voice to almost a whisper as he read me my Miranda rights. He was clearly uncomfortable, and I almost felt sorry for him. Except he was arresting me – the last act in a chain of events meant to intimidate and harass me because I’m a journalist.

This officer was a tool of power – and an example of how a good man can turn evil – and how great atrocities happen. Hannah Arendt wrote about the banality of evil when describing men who carried out the orders of Hitler in Nazi Germany, how career-oriented bureaucrats can act without conscience because they justify that they’re only following orders.

This is how a nation loses its soul. So you have to know what values you are fighting for, and you have to draw the lines now: where this side you’re good, and this side you’re evil. Help us #HoldTheLine.

So what about American social media platforms? As many of you know now, I’m both a partner and a critic of Facebook. Rappler is one of two Filipino fact-checking partners in the Philippines. Facebook is essentially the internet in the Philippines.

We are the canary in the coal mine because globally Filipinos spend the most time online (more than 10 hours a day) and on social media (the 4th year in a row we’re the top users around the world). But we are also democracy’s dystopian future.

Early this month, I was with Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie (you know he’s just turning 30 years old), and he told me that the Philippines “creates an ideal petri dish where you can experiment on tactics and techniques that you wouldn’t be able to as easily in the West…and if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter, you won’t get caught. And if it does work, then you can then figure out how to port that to the West.”

I asked him if the Philippines paved the way for Brexit and Donald Trump. You know what he said? He sidestepped a little, but I’ll read his entire quote so stay with me:

Filipino politics kinda looks a lot like the United States. You’ve got a president who was Trump before Trump was Trump, and you have relationships with people close to him with SCL and Cambridge Analytica. And you had a lot of data being collected – the 2nd largest amount of data after the United States collected in the Philippines.

This kid behind the psychological operations web of Steve Bannon backed by Robert and Rebekah Mercer added that “colonialism never died, it just moved online.”

So…this nightmare began for me more than 3 years ago. Rappler wrote the first pieces about it globally in 2016. I wrote 2 of the 3 parts of our first series and was rewarded with an average of 90 hate messages per hour.

If nothing changes, what’s happened to us is going to happen to you. It’s already happening now. Underlying it all is greed and fear, in our case the violence a brutal drug war that the UN says has killed at least 27,000 people, far more than the official number of 5,500.

People are afraid to stand up for what is right because there are costs: Rappler in the Philippines is a cautionary tale – and one of my arresting officers said it best when he was trying to silence our young reporter who was livestreaming. He said: “Be quiet, or you’re next.”

This micro-targeting online ad-driven business model structurally undermines human will. Our personal experiences are sucked into a database, organized by AI, then sold to the highest bidder. It is – as it has always been – about power and money. That has also siphoned money away from news groups, and if nothing is done, this represents a foundational threat to markets, election integrity, and democracy itself.

These social media platforms are behavioral modification systems we voluntarily enter. We are Pavlov’s dogs – and let me quote Wylie again as well as Blackberry co-founder Jim Balsillie: they said that data at this micropersonal level is NOT the new oil. It is plutonium. And we need to treat it like plutonium – with all the care that requires. Remember, I said, an atom bomb has exploded – and we all don’t know about it. Until we accept that, we can’t solve the problem.

So what can we do?

First, journalists need to collaborate. Throw out your old definitions. This is a new world. Collaborating isn’t easy because we were born to compete against each other. In the Philippines, our data tells us that news groups have been pushed to the periphery of our information ecosystem, and in the center are disinformation networks – some linked to Russian disinformation networks, some to China. They are all actively sharing each other – while we are not. This is how alternative realities bloom.

We have to stop taking the bait of emotions. Seek what we have in common over what drives us apart because that’s the way the bad guys are working: they take a fracture line in our societies and pound it open to separate us into us vs them.

And it’s not just the journalists…let’s bring in academia, tech, civil society – the truth-tellers. We have to join forces to protect the facts.

We have to fight now, while we’re strong – because, as we have learned, you only get weaker over time because this virus of lies saps civic engagement. If you have no facts, civil society becomes apathetic, and the voice with the loudest megaphone wins.

Second, we need to demand enlightened self-interest from tech companies because, in the long term, yes, the solution is education; medium term: media literacy. But in the here and now? It’s only the tech platforms that can do something meaningful.

Third, we need to create a global database of disinformation networks, and a global interpol that stops the impunity that nations and companies are getting away with today. Remember after the Holocaust and WWII, the world came together to try to stop the worst of human behaviors. That was when we got Bretton Woods, NATO, the UN Declaration of Human Rights. What are the values that govern the internet? How do we punish offenders?

We need to seriously come together and fight because an attack on one is an attack on all.

Power – and bullies – will never stop if you give in to them. We at Rappler live this every day.

Early this month, our presidential spokesman and chief legal counsel to President Duterte threatened to file cases against two news groups, including Rappler, because we called out a glaring conflict of interest. He split hairs and attempted to redefine his actions based on a technicality. One news group apologized. We did not.

Here’s the twist: the apology wasn’t enough for our Palace spokesman. His words ultimately justified Rappler’s decision to #HoldTheLine.

Political bullies who threaten and abuse journalists are never happy until they get complete capitulation.

Our battle is your battle.

Protect the rights guaranteed by our democracies or watch them slowly erode in plain sight. This is the challenge for all of us today – for next year’s Global Investigative Journalism Conference. What can we put in place today to protect our tomorrows?

I want to thank all the news organizations here who helped us shine the light. Please, let us do the same for every journalist under attack in every part of the world.

Remember: an attack on one is an attack on all. ",0
46,Maria A. Ressa,"Information operations are manipulating Filipinos online, but finally, Facebook is doing something to stop that
Editor’s Note: The original version of this piece was commissioned and first published online by Time Magazine on January 17, 2019, as part of its series on Facebook and its global impact. This is reposted with permission. 
For a time, my reputation – and peace of mind – was demolished by information operations on Facebook. It’s a cautionary tale for the United States.
I run Rappler, an online news site in the Philippines. In my country, Facebook essentially is the internet, thanks to subsidies from telecommunications companies that let people avoid data charges while on the site. But it has also made the Philippines a showcase for the destruction Facebook can enable.
The attacks against me and Rappler began appearing on Facebook in the summer of 2016. A year later President Rodrigo Duterte was repeating them in his State of the Nation Address. I have since been indicted on politically-motivated criminal charges, faced my first arrest warrant, and posted bail. Not just once, but 5 times in two separate courts. I need permission to travel outside the Philippines.
If I lose these tax evasion cases and others filed by the Philippine government, I could go to jail for 10 to 15 years.
All because I – and Rappler, the startup I helped create, 7 years old this month – continue to hold power to account, to do our jobs as journalists, and to #HoldTheLine against impunity in a drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people, according to human rights groups.
We know first-hand how social media and the law has been weaponized against perceived critics of the Duterte administration. We’ve been reporting on it from the start. 
In early October 2016, Rappler published a 3-part series on social media propaganda. It analyzed the emerging information ecosystem using what researchers later called “patriotic trolling” – online, state-sponsored hate meant to silence or intimidate specific targets. After the exposé appeared, I received an average of 90 hate messages per hour for the next month. 
The attacks on Facebook are insidious and extremely personal, from the way I look and sound to threats of rape and murder. As a former war zone correspondent, I have been in the line of fire, but nothing prepared me for this.
After all, a lie repeated a million times becomes the truth, shaping and conditioning public opinion, seeding the messages that would be repeated by President Duterte himself: that Rappler is CIA, fake news, owned by Americans, many more. It hits me every time I look back because these lies form the basis of some of the legal cases against us.
This is our daily pressure cooker: attacked from below by cheap armies on social media, and from above by President Duterte and the government.
The effort was extremely well organized. Each of the government propaganda machine’s 3 main content creators addressed a different slice of society: Sass Sasot created pseudo-intellectual content for the top 1%; Thinking Pinoy (RJ Nieto) targeted the middle class; and singer-dancer turned government official now congressional candidate Mocha Uson riled up the mass base.
As early as 2016, an #UnfollowRappler campaign activated at least 52,000 accounts. That was about 1% of our followers at that time – but consider that an earlier investigation showed us that 26 fake accounts on Facebook could reach up to 3 million others.

47,Maria A. Ressa,"Crisis is opportunity – that’s how we at Rappler learned to handle the attacks of the Duterte administration and keep on mission the past few years: To do our job holding the powerful – both the public and private sectors – accountable to the public we serve.
 
For two years, we lived by #InspireCourage – because we needed courage to protect the rights guaranteed in our Constitution.
 
This year in the face of the coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, #InspireCourage evolves to #CourageON – one that we hope will be a call for unity like we have yet to see from the Duterte administration. 

Hope comes from courage, from so many:

the courage of our health workers, who are doing their jobs, many without the right protective gear; 
the courage of our government officials and employees, who are trying to find the best path forward despite top-down shortcuts and knee-jerk commands;
the courage of our journalists who go out every day to find information so you don’t have to; 
the courage of ordinary Filipinos who keep on doing what they must despite the uncertainty of the times. 
As early as 2009, then-WHO Director General Dr. Margaret Chan gave a prescient warning: “All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans. Countries should remain on high alert for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia.”
 
At that time, it looked like the Philippines would be prepared for a possible pandemic. After all, it was seen as a model nation in dealing with SARS in 2003. 
 
In fact, the countries that have dealt well with SARS-CoV-2 (which causes the disease known as COVID-19) – Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong – learned their lessons from SARS and institutionalized them. Officials from these countries stuck to the facts and the plan.

Data from around the world shows strong government action is required to stop the spread of virus, to “flatten the curve.” (Read: Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now)


 
There are two complicating factors the Philippines must deal with before it can effectively fight a pandemic:

#FactsMatter: A pandemic in the time of social media carries the seeds of further disaster, especially if government is involved in information operations. Without facts, society as a whole becomes more vulnerable. As former health secretary Manuel Dayrit said, there is a “virus of fear and panic” which “often traveled much faster than the virus itself.” (Read: What we learned from SARS, according to ex-DOH chief Manuel Dayrit)
#UnitedWeStand: The Duterte government must work to unite the divided society it created. Now more than ever, our populist leader using anger, violence, and hate to divide and conquer needs to learn to unite, to become a leader for all. That’s what a pandemic demands: collective action – individuals working together for the common good. 
That’s the opportunity from this crisis.
 
We need to pull together. We have Filipino expertise to draw on: health and crisis experts who have lived through this before, countless local government officials. Embedded in our bureaucracy are the lessons learned from 2003. Let them surface. Leave the politics behind.

Instead of fragmented government voices contradicting each other, leaving the public confused, revive and update past protocols. 

We can learn lessons from other nations and how they are handling this. As one Singapore official said, this is not just about government. It’s a “whole of nation” approach. 

“In fact, this is an acid test of every single country’s quality of health care, standard of governance, and social capital,” said Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan. “If any one of this tripod is weak, it will be exposed and exposed quite unmercifully.”
 
This is a test of leadership.
 
Oh – and probably best to start with the health directions instead of law enforcement. No need to intimidate or threaten. Only if you fail to lead and inspire the bayanihan spirit will that be necessary.
 
We need clarity of thought. And deed.
 
Let’s bring out the best of our humanity to drown our fear.
 
We’re all in this together.

48,Maria A. Ressa,"The Philippines now serves as an inspiration for global jihadists, say terrorism experts, who asked the government to investigate an ISIS claim the Resorts World gunman converted to Islam
MANILA, Philippines – One month after the Resorts World attack in Manila, terrorism experts tell Rappler they believe the Philippines prematurely dismissed claims by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, IS, ISIL or Daesch, and asked for an investigation into its claim the Resorts World gunman was a recent convert to Islam.
The June 2 attack was “at the very minimum sanctioned – if not directed – by the Islamic State,” Veryan Khan, editorial director and founder of Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium (TRAC), told Rappler. TRAC is a digital intelligence repository focused on global terrorism and political violence.
“It’s very likely that the Resorts World was a terrorist operation,” said Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, cautioning authorities against dismissing ISIS claims as “propaganda.”
“It isn’t true that ISIS has a history of claiming others’ attacks as their own,” added Jones. “There’s usually a basis for it, even though their media departments don’t always get the details right.”
Khan and Jones are echoed by Rohan Gunaratna, author of Inside al-Qaeda and the head of the Singapore-based International Centre for Political Violence & Terrorism Research.
“The propaganda organs of ISIS such as Amaq exaggerate but do not falsely take credit for attacks mounted by other entities,” said Gunaratna, who, based on his study of ISIS, warned Philippine authorities of possible attacks a month before Resorts World and Marawi. (READ: ISIS planning more attacks in PH and region – terror expert) 
Experts who closely track the Islamic State agree: an ISIS claim of responsibility usually means the attack might have been planned, funded and directed by ISIS or inspired by the group’s sophisticated propaganda.
ISIS claims
In its section listing its global operations for the month, “Military and Covert Operations,” ISIS includes Resorts World, referring to it as “an inghimasi attack.” On June 8, ISIS’ glossy magazine, Rumiyah featured Resorts World on its cover with the title: “The Jihad in East Asia.”
Based on ISIS’ internal files translated and analyzed by the US military’s Combating Terrorism Center, an inghimasi is a “suicide fighter” or “those who submerse in enemy’s line with no intent to come back alive.” Its 10th edition was released in 9 languages: English, Uighur, Pashto, Kurdish, Indonesian, Bosnian, Russian, German and French, and focused on attacks on “Crusader soil” including Manchester in the United Kingdom and in Marawi in the Philippines. 
This follows ISIS’ 4 claims within about 24 hours of the June 2 attack:
Two by a Filipino ISIS operative supplying news, photos and videos from Marawi;
A succinct claim on the Amaq news agency, ISIS’ news arm;
A formal communique from Nashir, seen as a direct claim by its leaders. (READ: Casino targeted with suicide attack because it’s ‘haram’ – ISIS)
“Given that Amaq and Nashir claimed the attack as well as Rumiyah 10, there is no doubt that the Islamic State had some hand in the event,” concluded TRAC’s Khan. 
“Often they offer details that were never released by security forces, and they have a reason to not lie,” added Khan. “They would lose support if they went around claiming things they were only mildly certain of.”
Gunman converted to Islam?
Philippine police released edited CCTV video of a lone gunman identified as 42-year-old Jessie Javier Carlos, a former government employee whose gambling problems alienated him from his family. Within hours of the attack, police said it was a robbery.
The video shows a man calmly walking through Resorts World setting gambling tables on fire before, finally, setting himself on fire.
On Sunday, June 4 – two days after the attack, Philippine police categorically ruled out any links to ISIS.
On June 8, the Filipino ISIS operative in Marawi posted again, claiming Carlos adopted the Muslim name “Khair” after converting to Islam 4 months earlier.
“Our connections in Manila 1 week before the attack we already know his plan to destroy the casino because it is HARAM and making his life difficult because of the practices of gambling by the kufar [non-believers],” reads the message.
“That is why 10 minutes after his go signal to us we already posted a ‘LONEWOLF attack was conducted by the soldier of the caliphate.'”
Semion Almujaheed is the Telegram account used by this Filipino ISIS operative. It gained credibility by providing daily updates of the ongoing battles in Marawi. This account posted the photos and video of the Marawi Catholic priest held hostage on May 30, and was first to claim the Resorts World attack for ISIS within minutes of the first gunshot.
Almujaheed was also the first to refer to Carlos as a shaheed, someone who dies deliberately for his faith.
“It makes sense that a disgruntled employee with this man’s background could be vulnerable to recruitment and conversion,” said IPAC’s Sidney Jones. At this time, no evidence of radicalization or conversion exists apart from this ISIS claim. Studies do show that, among other factors like increasing alienation, as radicalism increases, family influence decreases. 
Intelligence officials from the Philippines approached by Rappler after June 23 say they have yet to look into this ISIS claim. One said this was the first time he heard about it, echoing official sentiment.
“ISIS has no credibility,” Armed Forces of the Philippines chief General Eduardo Año texted Rappler on June 10. “It was a case of a gambling addict who was heavily indebted. He went berserk and tried to steal gambling chips. When confronted by the PNP [Philippine National Police], he realized it was too late and committed suicide.”
“When the account said he put chips in his backpack, end of story agad ‘yun (That was the end of the story),” Año continued. “[A] terrorist will never do that. And he never shot at people.”
Yet, hours before his death, Carlos may have done exactly that.
On June 23, the Manila Police District said that Carlos is the only “person of interest” in the killings of two people, a lawyer and an ex-cop turned casino financier, a few hours before the Resorts World attack. Both were shot in the back of their heads inside a car. (READ: Resorts World gunman possible suspect in BMW killings – MPD)
Again, CCTV video shows a man who could be Carlos crawling out of the back of the car. If it is him, this could reinforce the theory of a man gone crazy, but could also show a possible new convert who killed before committing an act that some terrorist writings claim would cleanse his sins.
“Philippine authorities should investigate the Islamic State claim that Jessie Javier Carlos converted to Islam and was recruited by ISIS,” cautioned Gunaratna from Singapore. “Until that line of inquiry is completed, government should be careful of dismissing the ISIS claim.”
Governments lie
This isn’t the first time the Philippine government has denied terrorism: in 2004, investigators initially ruled the Superferry bombing was an accident. The details we had then at CNN, including an early claim to the attack as well as an extortion letter, allowed us to report it had the hallmarks of terrorism. 
It took about 8 months before the government admitted it was a terrorist attack, the largest maritime attack in Southeast Asia, carried out by Jemaah Islamiyah, then al-Qaeda’s arm in the region. There has always been a nexus between terrorism, crime, and drugs.
“I hate to speculate what the Philippine government is thinking,” TRAC’s Khan said. “I do know in other places like Bangladesh, when the government has adamantly denied Islamic State attacks even in the face of attacks claimed, often it’s been to either try to assuage the general fear of the citizens or protect their tourism industry.” 
The Bangladesh café attack in July 2016 has two things in common with the Resorts World attack:
Bangladeshi authorities blamed it on homegrown Islamist extremists, denying any link to ISIS; 
It was claimed by Nashir, the only attack outside Syria it claimed that summer. 
“It’s well known to have been directly planned from ash Sham [Syria],” added Khan. 
Vulnerable public
There are clues to what may be behind the Philippines’ denial. 
On June 19, an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court said the government deliberately painted a different picture from reality because of “psychological operations” against ISIS. 
To justify the declaration of martial law in Mindanao, authorities admitted government lied on May 24 when a military spokesman repeatedly said the military was in “full control” in Marawi and that “the armed men we are dealing with are not ISIS but members of a local terrorist group.”
Solicitor General Jose Calida quoted Año that “there had been a directive to all AFP spokesperson and personnel to downplay any news or information pertaining to this collective group” (referring to ISIS).
These statements “were made to encourage foreign investments and maintain confidence in the Philippine economy.” (READ: AFP downplayed ISIS threat as part of psychological ops – Año)
This strategy, though, leaves the public vulnerable.
Western governments issue terrorist alert warnings for the public good. They see it as a responsibility: citizens must be aware of threats so they can protect themselves. It has a legal responsibility: for example, an American citizen caught in a terror attack could file a case against the government if it had prior knowledge of a plot and failed to inform the public.
It’s a delicate balance between the public’s right to know and national security, part of the reason terrorist alert warnings are often vaguely worded.
About a month before the Resorts World attack, ISIS claimed two consecutive weekend attacks in Manila on April 28 and May 6, both denied by Philippine officials. (READ: ISIS planning more attacks in PH and region – terror expert) 
While the British government warned its citizens to avoid the Quiapo area on the same day as the May 6 blasts, the Philippine government ordered telecommunications companies to shut down cellular networks but gave no warning to its citizens.
Was this also part of psychological operations? 
It becomes a crucial question after the Filipino ISIS operative’s ominous warning:
“My message to the Philippine government denying the fact our soldiers conducted the attack, just wait. By Allah’s permission another strike will come and believe me you will never see it coming.”
PH inspiration for global jihadists
We need to examine the continuing evolution of the ideology which transformed al-Qaeda linked homegrown groups to ISIS in the Philippines. As early as 2011, we reported on the first black flag and the training camps in central Mindanao, which would later become the base of the Maute Group. (READ: ISIS’ global ambitions and plans for Southeast Asia)
“The longer term concern is that extremist ideology has taken root in the Philippines, and that will be much harder to eradicate,” said IPAC’s Jones. “There will be blowback to the rest of the region.”
“Until now the main fear has been that foreign fighters could return home from Syria and Iraq,” added Jones. “No one thought that the bigger threat would be foreign fighters who never set foot in the Middle East coming back from a conflict much closer to home.”
On January 13, 2017, the Malaysian government announced it had dismantled a Sabah cell to funnel ISIS fighters to Marawi. (READ: Filipino millennial joins ISIS in Syria)
That cell was allegedly receiving instructions from Isnilon Hapilon in the southern Philippines, the former Abu Sayyaf leader who has successfully united disparate homegrown groups and held ground in Marawi. (READ: ISIS to declare a province in Mindanao?)
In Rumiyah 10, Hapilon gains new status in ISIS’ ranks and is given a new name – with an entire section devoted to an interview with the “Emir of East Asia” Shaykh Abu “Abdullah al Muhajir.”
This “elevates Hapilon’s status not only in the Pacific Rim but globally,” said TRAC’s Khan. “Hapilon seemingly has won the political battle for who will run ISIS Pacific Rim, a competition for attention from ash Sham [Syria] that has been raging for at least two years.”
This video was posted in April before the attack on Marawi and Resorts World. It plants the ISIS flag on the Philippines, and in Filipino declares, “Ang mga Sundalo ng Khilafa sa Silangang Asya” or the Islamic fighters in East Asia.
The graphics are followed by video of training and fighting in central Mindanao – including the Maute Group’s brutal beheading of two Filipino sawmill workers in April 2016.
Indonesian extremists shared the video and were pushing each other to travel to the Philippines, with one saying in a chat room, “Don’t be a lion in the virtual world and a rabbit in the real world.”
Now that chatter is global.
In the fifth week of fighting, terrorists continue to hold ground in Marawi. On July 1, the government said at least 438 people are dead, with nearly 400,000 forced to flee their homes.
“TRAC has seen evidence that the success in Marawi has the attention of Indonesian ISIS supporters and serves as an aspiration to them,” said Khan. “Even ISIS supporters in Germany have started creating German language CGI propaganda posters to celebrate the success story of Marawi City.”
“The Philippines is now acting as a catalyst for Islamic State propaganda to distract from battlefield losses in ash Sham [Syria].”

49,Maria A. Ressa,"Analysts have long pointed out that ISIS has a sophisticated propaganda machinery and believes at least 50% of the battle is fought in the media
MANILA, Philippines – A Filipino ISIS operative responded to police statements on Friday, June 2, that claimed the Resorts World attack was a robbery.
“The police is covering up,” wrote “Semion Almujaheed” on pro-ISIS chat groups. “It’s not the soldiers of khilafah (caliphate) because they don’t want to be foolish in the media briefing earlier this morning (Friday, June 2).”
Semion Almujaheed is the account that provides daily updates on pro-ISIS channels of the ongoing battles in Marawi, where fighting enters the 12th day. In house-to-house urban warfare, Filipino soldiers are reclaiming land from the Maute Group, which pledged allegiance to ISIS and calls itself the Islamic State Ranao.
Almujaheed posted photos and video of the Marawi Catholic priest, Father Teresito Suganob, held hostage on Tuesday, May 30. 
Early Friday morning, this same account posted the first ISIS claim a few hours before the first police press conference. ISIS, or the Islamic State, is also known as IS, ISIL or Daesch.
Forbidden by Allah
Almujaheed gave the attacker his first public identity: “Abu Khair al Luzonee” or Khair from Luzon, perhaps a signal that the Mindanao-based group has now attracted members in Luzon. 
Why was the casino targeted and gambling tables burned?
“His main objective is to burn the casino because it is the main cause of HARAM in the region,” wrote Almujaheed. Haram is an Arabic word meaning “an act forbidden by Allah.” 
“He attained his shaheed and did not hesitate to surrender,” Almujaheed said. Shaheed is a Muslim honorific for those killed during jihad – a martyrdom fighters aspire for. A shaheed dies deliberately for his faith.
This provides some context to the strange description of how the attacker killed himself.
“He lay down on a bed, covered himself in a thick blanket and apparently doused himself in gasoline,” Phiippine National Police chief Ronald dela Rosa told reporters Friday.
If Almujaheed is correct, this is the first time an act of immolation for jihad has happened in the Philippines in the last 30 years. 
Given numerous conflicting statements, it’s still unclear whether he purposely entered Resorts World as a suicide attacker or if a bullet wound left death as his last option.
Why didn’t he target and kill more people like other suicide attackers? It’s a question that remains unanswered.
What we’re left with is an almost ritualistic photo of his body, charred beyond recognition, with his hands embracing his armalite in death.
ISIS central  
Shortly after Almujaheed’s post Friday, Amaq, the news agency of ISIS, announced that “Islamic State fighters carried out the Manila attack in the Philippines yesterday.”
Two hours later, ISIS issued a formal communique from its East Asia division, giving the attacker an Arabic nom de guerre:
With guidance from Allah and His granting of success, the brother Abu al-Khayr al-Arkhabili – may Allah accept him – was able to immerse with his machine gun amidst a gathering of Christian combatants in the resort “Resorts World” in the city of Manila in the Philippines.
The kunya or component of an Arabic name, according to Stratfor’s Scott Stewart, shows the attacker from Southeast Asia. From statements, this means we can glean that they call him Khair and he’s from Luzon in Southeast Asia.
The formal statement continues and builds on Almujaheed’s claim of suicide attack and martyrdom:
He took action inside it, inflicting death and causing harm, until he dismounted as a martyr, as we consider him and Allah is His advocate.
The statements vary in terms of casualties and inflate figures as ISIS has done in the past. Analysts have long pointed out that ISIS has a sophisticated propaganda machinery and believes at least 50% of the battle is fought in the media. (READ: How to fight ISIS on social media)
“Groups like that will always try to project themselves and take advantage of the fact that not everybody can determine whether what they’re saying is true or false,” former interior secretary Raffy Alunan told me during an interview Friday. Alunan handled the discovery of al-Qaeda and the subsequent attacks of its arm in Southeast Asia, Jemaah Islamiyah.
He said, “It cannot be emphasized that at a time like this, when you have ISIS on the march worldwide, and in Marawi, and in Sulu and Basilan, and Zamboanga, you have to assume …”
“Even in the region, right?” I interrupted. “A day after Marawi, there were twin suicide bombings in Jakarta at a bus terminal.”
“That’s right,” Alunan agreed. “In Jakarta, Egypt, Manchester…so you have to assume that Manila is a target.”
While all ISIS statements should be viewed as propaganda, they provide clues about what happened and hints at potential plans ahead.
Alunan said, “I think that notwithstanding the absence of enough information as to determine whether it was a terrorist attack or not…I think it’s still prudent for people to be vigilant and assume that there are terror threats out there lurking in the shadows ready to pounce.”

50,Maria A. Ressa,"Philippines – He is a millennial – the only identified Filipino fighting in Syria for ISIS, the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, also known as IS, ISIL or Daesch.
On June 21, 2016, he appeared in a 20-minute video released on pro-ISIS Telegram accounts, calling on Muslims to join the jihad. The Filipino, along with an Indonesian and Malaysian, spoke in their native languages and urged Muslims to fight in Syria or the Philippines.
“If you cannot go to [Syria], join up and go to the Philippines,” said the Malaysian.
The Filipino urged his “brothers” to be strong.
“Mag-ingat kayo at maging malakas, huwag kayong magpadala sa mapanlinlang na taktika ng bagong halal na … si Duterte. Sumpain siya ng Allah,” he said.
The men then beheaded 3 Caucasian males, whom they claimed were “spies of the crusader alliance.”
Now classified documents obtained by Rappler name the Southeast Asians, including the only identified Filipino fighting in Syria for ISIS. Mohammed Saifudin Faiz is from Indonesia; Mohammed Rafi Udin is from Malaysia.
The lone Filipino is 26-year-old Mohammad Reza Kiram. His passport photo below is verified by the Philippine National Police. 
Born in Zamboanga City, Kiram travelled with his wife and daughter to Syria in 2015, according to a confidential Interpol report dated December, 2016. 
Turkish officials confirmed their arrival at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport on May 20, 2015. Authorities from at least 3 countries, including the Philippines, say they are now in Raqqa.
Arrests in Malaysia this week spotlight a new ISIS terror cell using Sabah as a transit point to funnel recruits from Southeast Asia and South Asia to the southern Philippines, evidence that Kiram’s rallying cry last June is now being carried out.
Intelligence documents say Kiram was allegedly part of Ansar al-Khalifa, also known as AKP, Ansar Khalifa Philippines, Ansar al-Khilafah or Ansar Khilafah, the latest evolution of a sub-group once part of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
AKP and the death of Tokboy
AKP pledged allegiance to ISIS in a YouTube video in 2015, largely believed to be the group in a video distributed in November 2015 threatening the APEC Summit in Manila. It was globally distributed by ISIS propaganda sites. (READ: ISIS’ global ambitions and plans for Southeast Asia)
Its influential leader, Mohammed Jaafar Maguid or “Tokboy”, was killed in Sarangani earlier this month. Under him, AKP operated throughout central Mindanao and maintained operational links with Indonesian group, MIT or Mujahidin Indonesia Timur, perhaps the most aggressive ISIS affiliate in Indonesia. Both groups once worked together under JI, once al-Qaeda’s arm in Southeast Asia.
The Philippine police and military continue operations until today against the AKP and another closely-affiliated group which also pledged allegiance to ISIS, the Maute group.
ISIS and the Maute group
The Philippine police verified Rappler’s early analysis that the Maute group, led by Abdullah Maute, is behind the September 2, 2016 bomb detonated at a night market in Davao City, killing at least 14 people and injuring at least 70. 
An Interpol document obtained by Rappler estimates the Maute group has about “90 members who possess various small arms and – as demonstrated by the Davao City bombing – the capability to make Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) with military munitions.”
Abdullah’s father, Cayamora Maute, according to military sources, was a senior official of the MILF, the largest Muslim separatist group now involved in peace talks with the government. Philippine military documents show the family has been monitored since 2007, when Maute and his wife sheltered and worked with JI leaders.
That history explains the radicalization of their sons, who criticized the MILF leadership, the peace process, and later pledged allegiance to ISIS.  
2016 was a busy year for the Maute group:
From February 20 to March 1, the group attacked a military camp and established 3 strongholds in Lanao del Sur, displacing nearly 30,000 people. It took 10 days for the military to regain control.
On April 21, a Facebook account posted two photos showing the Maute group beheading two sawmill workers in orange jumpsuits, like ISIS public executions.
On August 27, 50 men led by Abdullah Maute freed 8 of their members and 20 other prisoners from a Lanao del Sur jail.
On August 29, an ISIS propaganda arm claimed ISIS was behind that prison raid in Marawi.
On November 26, the Maute group occupied Butig, Lanao del Sur again. They removed the Philippine flag from the old town hall and replaced it with the ISIS flag.
On November 28, an IED was discovered near the US embassy in Manila. Two suspects linked to the Maute group were arrested shortly after. An Interpol report says, “the foiled bombing in Metro Manila was meant to distract the attention of the authorities and relieve the pressure on the Maute group from the military authorities surrounding them in Butig, Lanao del Sur.”

Philippine authorities also said the IED from Manila was similar to the one used in Davao City in September.
Caliphate in Mindanao?
Which brings us back to the sole Filipino identified with ISIS in Syria. A little more than 6 months ago, Mohammad Reza Kiram’s video appealed to Muslim recruits to join the jihad in the Philippines.
Operations in Southeast Asia intensified since then, with ISIS setting up transit cells and conduits to bring foreigners to the Philippines.
Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Centre for Political Violence & Terrorism Research, said at least 10 Malaysian terrorists are in the Philippines and have established Katibah Al Muhajir or Battalion of Migrants in the Philippines.
Gunaratna said the new battalion, composed of Malaysians and Indonesians, was created because Southeast Asian recruits couldn’t travel to the Middle East. Filipino intelligence sources say this group is working with Isnilon Hapilon, the senior ideological leader of the Abu Sayyaf.
Last year, Isnilon became the consolidated leader of at least 4 groups that pledged allegiance to ISIS. (READ: ISIS to declare a province in Mindanao?) 
“While it has not been formally declared as a province or wilayat, ISIS has endorsed an Abu Sayyaf leader, Isnilon Hapilon, as amir for Southeast Asia, and Southeast Asians in Syria have pledged their loyalty to him,” stated an October report by the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Confict (IPAC).
On Thursday, January 26, Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told a press conference that ISIS is communicating directly with Hapilon, who moved from his base in Basilan to Central Mindanao last December, joining the Maute group and AKP there. Operations intensified this week.
“Mayroon silang contact ngayon (They’ve made contact). One of the leaders in Basilan, Isnilon Hapilon, moved to Central Mindanao allegedly on the behest of ISIS people in the Middle East to find out if Central Mindanao is more conducive to the establishment of their wilayat (province),” Lorenzana said.
Still, there are victories.
On January 13, 2017, Malaysian police announced the arrest of a 31-year-old Filipino watch seller and his Malaysian co-conspirator and fiancée from Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. That uncovered a terrorist cell allegedly receiving orders from the southern Philippines.
According to a press statement by Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar, the Filipino was the cell’s chief recruiter, taking instructions from Hapilon and a Malaysian with him, Dr Mahmud Ahmad.
A former Universiti Malaya lecturer, Ahmad trained at an al-Qaeda training camp in the late 1990s and is now deeply entrenched with the ISIS, according to Malaysian officials. He recruited and arranged for Malaysians to fight in Syria as early as March, 2014, including Malaysia’s first suicide bomber, Ahmad Tarmimi Maliki. 
“With these arrests, the Special Branch crippled a new Daesh terror cell that planned to make Sabah a transit point for terrorists from Southeast Asia and South Asia to infiltrate into the Philippines,” Khalid said, referring to ISIS as Daesch, its Arabic acronym.
“ISIS seems to be everywhere,” President Duterte told me at the end of last year, warning that the group is focusing on Southeast Asia as it loses ground in Syria and Iraq.
Duterte is the first president to admit the presence of ISIS, a stark contrast to the repeated denials of the military and the past administration.
He warned of recruitment from schools, saying he feared some of his own relatives may have been lured by ISIS. The recruitment is backed by the research of Indonesia’s IPAC. 
“There is some evidence that the Maute group and the AKP have been able to use the appeal of the ISIS brand to attract university students. The more extremists in Mindanao can attract educated and computer-savvy cadres, the greater the likelihood of cross-regional contact,” the IPAC report stated.
Kiram is a cautionary tale: a Filipino millennial now fighting in Syria with ISIS.

51,Maria A. Ressa,"Why does someone risk their life, their freedom, to fight for the rights of others? 

That kept going around my head while on a video call on December 19 with eight women Nobel peace laureates, brought together by the temporary release from prison of 52-year-old Narges Mohammedi, Nobel Peace Prize, Iran, 2023. 

Hello, I’m Maria Ressa, and I’m one of the 4 co-founders of Rappler. I received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, making Rappler the only fully functioning Nobel newsroom today. During this emotional call, Rappler was having our Christmas party, and I actually showed Narges and the Nobel women our office and our team, who at that moment were singing “Defying Gravity” (the theme of the night).  Which is exactly what Narges has been through: “arrested 13 times, convicted five times and sentenced to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes,” said the Nobel committee. Jailed in Iran’s notorious Evin prison, she was released for 21 days in December for an operation to remove a tumor. When she was wheeled out, she carried a picture of Mahsa Amini, and yelled, “Women. Life. Freedom.”

Despite the looming end of her freedom, Narges was smiling and resolute. We spoke about gender apartheid, mass executions, protests, wars — how could we not with Jody Williams (1997, United States), Shirin Ebadi (2003, Iran), Leymah Gbowee (2011, Liberia), (Tawakkol Karman (2011, Yemen), Malala Yousafzai (2014, Pakistan), and Oleksandra Matviichuk (2022, Center for Civil Liberties, Ukraine) on the call. 

BUT we also spoke about perseverance, about helping each other, about commitment, about love. When you’re on the front lines, you celebrate every win.

World is worse than you think
It almost seems like these qualities underlying the courage of the women on the call — hard work, empathy, the values behind the world’s major religions (in Christianity, “do unto others as you would have them do unto you”) — have gone out of style. Everyone wants quick rewards, the dopamine high of popularity (leading to populism at scale). 

The world is turned upside down by the perverse incentive structure of the technology that connects us all: when lies laced with fear, anger and hate pound open the sensitive fracture lines of our societies, for profit. That system of “engagement” and microtargeting is the most powerful tool of manipulation of those seeking and maintaining power. When politicians use it, it’s information operations; when nations use it, it’s information warfare — and it is reshaping the world. 

It’s worse than you think: the new “axis” — Russia, China, Iran and North Korea — are united by their grievances against the West, especially after sanctions largely failed after Russia invaded Ukraine, and helped bring them together. With the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Sudan, Myanmar, and our ongoing near-daily confrontations in the West Philippine Sea, it’s increasingly clear that conflicts around the world are interconnected. Look at Syria, Serbia, Venezuela, or North Korean troops fighting for Russia in Ukraine. 

Another complication: Russia, China, and North Korea already possess nuclear weapons, while Iran may only be weeks away from a nuclear breakthrough if it were to aggressively pursue it. Are we already in World War III?

Elections are manipulated
My latest book, How to Stand up to a Dictator, has been translated into about 25 languages, including Mongolian, Georgian and Romanian. I was in Tbilisi, Georgia, earlier this year and listened to its citizens prepare to fight a Russian-style foreign agents law. As I write this, more than 200,000 Georgians have been out on the streets for nearly a month demanding new elections, protesting for its democratic values. (Add Venezuela, Mozambique, and many others in these electoral protests.) 

Shortly before that, in Romania, its Constitutional Court voided elections after a little known candidate without a political party and supported by the Kremlin’s information operations on TikTok took first place in its run-off elections. This is the first and most decisive move any nation has taken against the information warfare social media has enabled since 2016. 

As I have said repeatedly for years now, we cannot have election integrity with the manipulation of our emotions enabled by social media. Nerve’s latest report before the US elections shows exactly what can happen: the manipulation of the youth, the weaponization of race and gender, among them.

This new “axis” — what Anne Applebaum called Autocracy, Inc — is not united in any political ideology – only pulled together in its thirst for power and money. It begins in the public information ecosystem. The global trend in 2024, the super-election year (74 national elections globally, with the last one taking place December 29 in Chad) shows democracy losing: we started the year with 71% of the world now under autocratic rule, and while some in media see election results as a failure of incumbents in 10 major countries (the first time this has ever happened in almost 120 years), those of us who have lived through this (and survived) see this as the success of insidious voter manipulation on social media.

What Rappler is doing
Over the last decade, we at Rappler have dealt with and become frustrated by analysis paralysis. The attacks we lived through and our data analysis since 2014 pushed us to the forefront of the fight for information integrity.

Our journalism remains the same: investigative reports that hold power to account. Read and watch our best in 2024. We learned that the form and substance of journalism is not enough. It needs to be coupled with the best of what technology has to offer — to reimagine what technology could do without surveillance capitalism.

What would a public interest tech stack look like that brings trusted information to our communities, the citizens in our democracy? If we succeeded, could we stitch together a global community — with news organizations as tent pegs in a global federation?

In 2020, we launched Lighthouse: its movements feature allowed us to bring some partners and NGOs into our tech stack. In 2022, we began creating a PH-wide data lake with an ontology, knowledge graph, and vectorDB to allow generative AI to automate creation of pages anchored on facts. In mid-2023 after OpenAI launched its chatbot, we zoomed GPT-4 onto each story page and created a 3 bullet-point summary of every Rappler story. 

Around that time, we were one of 10 from 1000 global groups selected by OpenAI to use its chatbot for democratic consultation (aiDialogue). Working with the Quezon City local government, we began to finetune AI use for public consultations. It was exciting to think of the ability to widen democratic participation in a more systematic manner. 

Finally, a year ago, we launched Rappler Communities, a matrix protocol chat app that allows real people to have real conversations in a shared reality essential for any democracy. At this existential moment for news, we’ve created an MVP not only for survival but which we believe will allow news to thrive with a sustainable business model in a global public information ecosystem anchored in facts. 

Don’t be overwhelmed 
Our times demand you act. Choose and build the world you want. 

We can’t begin to work on solutions for climate change unless we agree on the problem. Leaders can’t govern until we begin to bring nuance and complexity back into the public domain. The good in each of us can’t emerge until we restore an environment of trust. That can’t happen if each of us is being insidiously manipulated. 

So download and join our community: first in the Philippines, followed by Indonesia, South Africa, and Brazil. Try our new RAI — what generative AI looks like if you want to anchor in facts! If you’re a news group that wants to join, let us know. If you’re a funder who wants a systemic solution, help us build. 

I’ve learned a lot in the years we’ve been under attack. In 2019, we created the International Fund for Public Interest Media to help bring new money to news groups. In 2021, we created a whole of society distribution system for facts — #FactsFirstPH in partnership with the Google News Initiative (parts of which were replicated in other parts of the world). In 2022, I became the vice chair of the leadership panel of the UN’s Internet Governance Forum to try to understand the multilateral system, and in 2023, I accepted the chair of the World Movement for Democracy to understand how human rights and civil society groups work together. Each of these taught me lessons in governance as well as showing me why our world today is broken.

The year ahead
We’re at a global inflection point, and 2025 will push us to a tipping point for violence, for fascism. Or not. It depends on what each of us does now.

So don’t be overwhelmed. Don’t be depressed. Don’t disengage. 

Instead, take the four action points I recommend from the last speech I gave in 2024, my first in a Jewish temple in front of Muslims, Christians, Palestinians — a truly interfaith and diverse community of young and old alike. Religion and faith are crucial parts of our world views. It’s why I will return to the Vatican in January to help Pope Francis kick off the Jubilee, which happens once every 25 years. 

Hope for a better future comes from action, from perseverance. And faith. That’s what the Nobel Women showed me. That’s why we risk our freedom and dedicate our lives to fighting for all our rights.",0
52,Maria A. Ressa,"We can allow the fracture lines in our society to break open. Or we can work to heal the growing divides. 
The time we spent together last night was so special because despite our differences, we shared a space where we all felt safe. Sadly, this isn’t the world we live in today. But last night proved it doesn’t take much to create it; all it needs is our collective will and our empathy. 

In the last few weeks, I’ve been to Reyjkavik, a gathering of more than 400 women leaders led by Iceland’s female president, to Johannesburg, where 600 civil rights leaders gathered to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the end of apartheid, and to Cape Town, to deliver the Desmond Tutu lecture on the 40th anniversary of his peace prize. 

In a 4-hour meeting in Nelson Mandela’s house, as chair of the World Movement for Democracy, I heard bleak assessments of democracy around the world from our steering committee: of the rise of the far right globally; how we are electing illiberal leaders democratically (as of early this year, for example, V-Dem said that 71% of the world is now under autocratic rule); how 2024, the tipping point year for elections — when about half the world voted — may have set the stage for the end of democracy. 

From Venezuela, Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Mozambique to South Korea, which declared martial law and then rescinded it … to France, which just lost its prime minister, to Georgia, which has had 10 days of violent protests. At least 500 arrested, friends are now saying 270, many journalists, were beaten brutally by government thugs. For years now, I’ve shown data in different countries around the world that technology is the match that set the world’s dry kindling on fire. Move fast, break things, said Mark Zuckerberg — and Big Tech broke democracy. 

I learned that the fracture lines of society pounded open are the same regardless of country or culture. The main two are gender and race — and the attacks are fueled by religion. Sexism that turns into misogyny; and racism that finds its way into constitutions like Hungary, where it’s called white replacement theory. You’ll hear it in the news as immigration or inflation, but dig deeper, and you will see gender and race. 

When I turn on the news, it almost feels like we’re already in World War III — from the trenches of Ukraine to the rubble of Gaza and the forgotten battlegrounds of Sudan, Myanmar, until recently, Syria and many other invisible conflicts around the world. But these are wars fought not just with missiles and tanks, but with algorithms, disinformation, and the systematic destruction of truth. 

Big Tech — from American companies in Silicon Valley to China’s TikTok — transformed social media from a tool of connection into a weapon of mass behavioral engineering. These platforms are not neutral technologies; they are sophisticated systems designed to exploit our deepest psychological vulnerabilities. They monetize our outrage and hate; amplify our divisions; and systematically erode our capacity for nuanced thinking and empathy. 

In 2018, MIT said that lies spread 6 times faster on social media. You tell a lie a million times, it becomes a fact. 

Betrayal of human dignity
Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without these three, we don’t have a shared reality, let alone solve existential problems like climate change. We can’t have journalism; we can’t have democracy. The business model of Big Tech — surveillance capitalism — is built on a fundamental betrayal of human dignity — where data privacy has become a myth, and AI and algorithms have cloned and manipulated us: 

Creating echo chambers that exacerbate existing biases;
Prioritizing conflict over understanding; 
Monetizing human attention at the expense of social cohesion. 
This is not an accident. It is a deliberate design that brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year to these companies. 

In this world, people of faith have a critical role that goes beyond individual belief. Your congregations, your interfaith networks, your community organizations are not just sanctuaries of spiritual reflection – they are — like journalists — the frontline defenders of our shared democratic values. 

In my book, How to Stand Up to a Dictator, I write about how the golden rule. “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” has guided me throughout my life. 

It helped define courage for me in a world increasingly shaped by lies: the courage to speak when silence is safer; the courage to build bridges when walls seem easier; and the courage to stand for truth even when it feels like the entire world is against you. 

I like the South African word ubuntu — “I am because we are” — an antidote to many of our problems today. It’s a universal truth that our faith communities embody. The pain of one is the pain of all. When Big Tech rewards the worst of who we are, UBUNTU teaches us that our fates are interconnected; that the fight for truth, justice, and peace is not someone else’s battle; it is ours. 

So what can you do? I have 4 suggestions:

Collaborate, collaborate, collaborate. Build and strengthen trust now to close the fracture lines of society that information operations will try to pound open, pitting us against each other.
2. Speak truth with moral clarity. Silence in the face of injustice is complicity. Whether it’s systemic racism, economic inequality, or the erosion of democratic norms, people of faith must reclaim their prophetic voice. Demand transparency and accountability from those who control our public information ecosystems — from governments to Big Tech to media.
Protect the Most Vulnerable. Support journalists, human rights defenders and activists who risk their lives. Remember the Martin Neimoller quote from Germany? Here’s our PH version — published by our largest newspaper after my first arrest: “First they came for the journalists. We don’t know what happened next.” Your networks can be powerful shields for marginalized communities. Support immigrants, religious minorities, the LGBTQ+ and others who face discrimination. Your collective vigilance can prevent the normalization of hate. 
Recognize Your Power. Building peace is not reserved for heroes; it’s the collective work of people who refuse to accept and live lies. Rappler would not have survived without the help of our community, always reminding me of the goodness of human nature. You are powerful and can be part of a tidal wave of change for the good. 
Let me repeat them: collaborate, collaborate, collaborate; speak truth with moral clarity; protect the most vulnerable; and recognize your power. 

Even at the worst of times, hope is not passive; it’s active, relentless and strategic. Our faith traditions carry centuries of resilience; we need to share those stories of transformation. 

There’s this TS Eliot quote I love about “the present moment of the past.” It’s the idea that the latest novel you read is affected by the fact that you read Shakespeare, but your understanding and appreciation of Shakespeare will be affected by the latest novel that you read. 

In this present moment of our shared past, we have a choice — and it will create our future as much as change how we look at our past. We can allow the fracture lines in our society to break open. Or we can work to heal the growing divides. 

Because this is it. This time matters. What you choose to do matters.",0
53,Maria A. Ressa,"What will survive in the age of machines? Investigative journalism built on an ecosystem of federated news organizations anchored on facts.
It’s bleak. Given present trends, the death of the news business can happen within a year or two, directly linked to the corruption of the public information ecosystem enabled by Big Tech. 

This year, we’re already seeing massive layoffs, and it’s expected to get worse. I sit on the board of several news organizations, two of them American, and drops in both revenue and distribution (which for digital news are connected) continue. This acceleration seemed triggered by the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT and the succeeding arms race for generative AI. Predictably, Big Tech pushed generative AI, and even journalism schools, foundations and NGOs are encouraging quick adoption without realizing that we’re again committing the same mistake we did by putting the share button on our websites. We’re taking Big Tech at face value, falling for its hype and lobbying – and, again, giving these companies our data and relationships. 

Bloomberg took an expensive approach: use open source LLM (or large language models) then train it on your data. Moat it so that other LLMs won’t be able to use your output as training data. It brings its own problems, aside from the cost. Rappler did what we could afford, and in June 2023, we rolled out our first experiment with generative AI: adding a three-bullet point summary for every article on our site.

By then we began to fear that Big Tech was going to cut off the distribution of news.

What’s clear is that journalism won’t survive if we don’t build our own tech. 

There are only three ways a website gets traffic: direct, social, and search. Generative AI search was clear with Bing, sparking the search war. Google soon began experiments publicly and rolled out SGE, Search Generative Experience, in 125 countries, including the United States and the Philippines. (While many of the companies rolling out LLMs said that news groups could opt out, it was impossible to do that with SGE and Google: it built its LLM on top of search so if a news group opted out, it would disappear from the internet.) 

By Q1 2023, it became clear that search, which brings 60-69% of Rappler traffic, could disappear. That same quarter, social media referrals dropped without any warning.

Falling off the cliff
Elon Musk bought Twitter in late October 2022. Within a month, he was announcing policy decisions publicly and changing his mind as quickly. He was doxing critics on the platform and brigading, and by January 2023, he dissolved Twitter’s Trust & Safety Council and later fired his trust & safety team. 

In January 2023, Facebook/Meta, the world’s largest distributor of news, began aggressively choking traffic to news sites. Traffic fell off the cliff in May. Similarweb data showed that by August 2023, global Facebook referral traffic to the top 30 news sites was down 62%. News sites like the Guardian and Business Insider dropped up to 80%. Buzzfeed declined 72% then, perhaps contributing to its decision to shut down its news group.

What Rappler did
We decided to build our own technology, connecting a chat app directly to our news feed. We built it on the Matrix protocol, open source, secure, decentralized – and used by countries which value data privacy like Germany and France. 

Instead of throwing our community back into the toxic sludge of social media where they are insidiously manipulated, we decided to build a safe space, where real conversations and relationships can develop. 

Like Project Agos, our climate and disaster risk reduction campaign, we know we can create a positive feedback loop between government and the people that can lead to real-time action. 

This is our announcement of our quiet matrix protocol roll-out last December. Technology built by journalists is also governed by our standards & ethics manual, making our community guidelines simple.

When the trends became clear by Q1 2023, we pivoted quickly and began building community tech. In the graph below of unique users from Similarweb, you can see the top Philippine news sites: Inquirer is the top newspaper followed by PhilStar (both about 40 years old); GMANetwork is the top television station (63 years old), followed by ABS-CBN (78 years old). Rappler is 12 years old, with about 1/10th of these groups’ newsgathering resources. 

Focus on the blue line for Rappler, and you can see that it began rising in July 2023, a month after we rolled out generative AI summaries, implemented editorial shifts in form and substance – of video, unique, in-depth stories, and newsletters – moves driven by data from the user journey through our site. Our user base grew steadily as we continued our tech build and evolved our editorial processes and workflows. By November 2023, Rappler surpassed all other Philippine news groups with the largest Filipino community.  

This upward trend continued into 2024. Rappler also tops Philippine news sites in deduplicated audience (meaning across all devices). Again, this is an upward trend that started in July 2023.

What’s ahead
The race is to be able to bring our community together before the ability to trawl social media and the referral traffic from search ends. As generative AI deluges the internet with deepfakes (or synthetic media) and low-quality content, public distrust and cynicism will increase because of the lack of information integrity. That will have an impact on the behavior of people and society, and the types of governments we elect. I’ve long said: without facts, you can’t have truth; without truth, you can’t have trust. Without these, we have no shared reality, no democracy, and it becomes impossible to deal with the existential problems of our times like climate change. 

At Rappler, our community will have a safe space, where facts are clear, and constructive debate can enable the processes of a strong democracy. In the coming year, we hope to be able to connect at least four other independent news groups through our matrix protocol chat app. That federation allows us to build a global network of news bottom up – an extremely valuable community of TRUST. 

We can govern this group using a similar system as the Internet Governance Forum, without one group controlling policies and direction. That could include a quality ad network which can rival present-day ads spewed into the corrupted public landscape. Quality can win, especially if you have a global community focused on facts and the values that strengthen democracy.

In a federated system of news organizations, we can protect our data with a tech stack and execution that can help us collectively create a more sophisticated LLM, a new form of news consumption with chatbots using generative AI we can anchor on facts. 

To illustrate: in the next few months, Rappler will be finishing its ontology: building a knowledge graph that will anchor our LLM using GraphRAG to ensure the integrity of information that our chatbot delivers. This integrates the machine into the process of journalism in a way that allows machine-generated content that is anchored on facts. This is a far more labor- and time-intensive execution of a project we rolled out in 2022, when we created the first Philippine politics knowledge graph that allowed GPT3 to accurately generate nearly 50,000 pages served to a public front-end.

Generative AI could explore a wealth of possibilities that journalism hasn’t touched. Unlike past machine learning and AI, this has the ability to create, to code, to self-improve. But the difference in our execution is that it is both back-end and front-end, machine and human, and more importantly, we assure the public of fact-based, evidence-based information. 

So what is the future of news? 

When you hold power to account, it’s called journalism. 

So what will survive in the age of machines? Investigative journalism built on this ecosystem. Think fractal stories, which challenge the traditional linear narrative structure. Like hyperlinks, but far more recursive, combining (wo)man and machine. 

This approach encourages exploration and discovery, leading to greater depth and a deeper appreciation for the complexity of the human experience. This restores nuance, critical thinking, and trust back into the public sphere. And engages communities in meaningful ways.",0

It’s been a grueling week trying to understand why people fight to make things better.
 
Last Thursday, October 18, I walked into the co-working space of the Civil Media Company and the Civil Foundation in Brooklyn. Days earlier, the staff spent a sleepless night watching the close of the world’s first token sale on blockchain in search of a sustainable model for news. Without ducking, they immediately announced they had failed to reach the $8 million dollar minimum target but that they were here to stay and had learned valuable lessons for the next round.
 
Failure means TRY AGAIN.
 
I sit on the Civil Council, a small group of advisors on the Civil Constitution now being written. Later, we become a court of appeals for this open platform for ethical journalism with huge ambitions: to restore trust, remove vested interests, find a business model, and define the best future for news.

In the short time I was with them, we talked about our dreams, and I soaked up the intense energy of people who will not give up.

The backdrop is dire: the reports coming out about disinformation/computational propaganda, attacks on journalists, and deteriorating trust in social media platforms; and the unveiled lawsuit against Facebook and the allegation that it willingly misled news publishers globally about the metrics for video views, inflated by up to 900% (which Facebook denies).
 
In the Philippines, the filing of candidacies for the 2019 elections shows patronage politics is firmly entrenched with even party list seats blatantly hijacked in bids for power; and feudal families building old and new dynasties turning politics into family businesses – Marcos, Estrada, Duterte, Cayetano, Binay, Revilla, to name a few. (Read: Duterte: ‘Ayaw ko ng dynasty, but we are forced’)
 
For Rappler, our lawyers tell me two of our politically-motivated cases are coming up for a decision, and that at least one of them may carry an arrest warrant. (Thought bubble: really?! Still, I remain hopeful about the professional men and women in our judiciary who will hold the line against power.)

All these are playing out against one of the most horrific attacks against journalists – the brutal killing and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi. (Read our editorial: #AnimatED: The Jamal Khashoggi in each of us)

 

So why do we persist?

Because we must.

We are living through the creative destruction of global power structures by social media. Their “unintended consequences” destroyed democracy as we know it, helping cheap armies on social media redefine geopolitical power, elections, and the fabric of our societies.

As the US, Brazil, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines enter election season, read this Data & Society report released last week that shows how today’s digital advertising infrastructure is being weaponized by political and anti-democratic actors.
 
We have to do all we can to fix it, no matter how small, and demand transparency and reforms from the social media giants. (Read: Soldiers in Facebook’s War on Fake News are Feeling Overrun)
 
We have to fight back against power’s move to corrupt, coopt, coerce, and entice.
 
Ironically, it was Facebook and YouTube that gave me the title for today’s newsletter. Over the weekend, its algorithms somehow knew I was looking for hope and served me the story of singer/songwriter Mandy Harvey, who wrote her original “Try.”
 
With near-perfect pitch, she had always wanted to be a choir director. She became completely deaf at 18 and was forced to drop out of her music program at Colorado State University. After a period of depression, she relied on a visual tuner and muscle memory to teach herself how to make music – to sing again and to compose her own songs.

“I want to do more with my life than just give up,” she said in America’s Got Talent. “It’s not the dream that I always had,” she added. “That’s okay – because I showed up, and I did something I never believed I could do.” 

We show up.
 
We TRY. ",0
55,Maria A. Ressa,"My friends said, 'Don't go home.' It was never an option. I would face these charges head-on.
Editor’s Note: This blog was first distributed as a newsletter under “Brave New World” on Monday, December 10, 2018. To sign up for weekly Rappler newsletters, click here. On December 11, Time magazine named Maria Ressa, one of the “Guardians,” along with Jamal Khashoggi, the Capital Gazette, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. They are TIME’s Person of the Year 2018.

December 1 was a test for me.
 
I knew an arrest warrant had been issued by my government on politically motivated tax evasion charges. My flight home from Paris was leaving that day, arriving in Manila at 930 pm Sunday, half an hour after the night court closed. That meant that if I was arrested, I couldn’t file bail until Monday morning.
 
I would spend the night in jail.
 
How did I handle that? 

I prepared to spend the night in jail. I packed a change of clothes, pajamas, and a toothbrush in my carry-on. Like preparing for any war zone, you prepare for the worst, and hope for the best.
 
While friends outside the Philippines told me not to come home, that was never an option.

I am so proud of the courage and fortitude of Rappler and our supporters. Despite great odds, we continue to do the best we can, refusing to accept or bend to the abuse of power that is rolling back democracy in our country. (READ: A new weapon against press freedom in the Philippines)

I am not a radical person, in temperament and politics, but these repeated attacks were unshackling me, allowing me to speak frankly about what we are seeing first-hand.
 
Facing these ridiculous charges head-on would shine the light on the way the law has been weaponized. 

And that was exactly what I said when I got home!

I posted bail the next day, and a day after that, we filed a motion to dismiss because – among other things – we believe the court that issued the warrant doesn’t have jurisdiction over this case. (Read: Rappler to Pasig court: Tax charges ‘clear case of persecution’)

I was back in court Friday, December 7, when the judge accepted our motion, gave the Bureau of Internal Revenue 15 days to respond, and postponed my arraignment. 

In another court, however, Senator Bong Revilla, despite the evidence of bank deposits and unexplained wealth, was allowed to go free. (READ: Majority justices ‘took the cudgels’ for Revilla – dissenter)
 
This Saturday’s 4th week of protests in France brought me back to Paris, which is where I faced – and conquered – my own fears.
 
This is one of those times when you just can’t be afraid. You have to look at the worst that can happen, accept it, then move on. Do the right thing.
 
While I was thinking it through hours before boarding the flight back to Manila, I heard protestors outside my hotel – “yellow jackets” or “yellow vests” – who were intially triggered by fuel price increases to help France deal with climate change.
 
I didn’t even think. I picked up my coat, tripod, camera, and followed them into the streets.

These protests form the strongest challenge to President Emmanuel Macron, when the extreme left and the far right can find fertile ground to weaken his administration. They have been going on for about a month now, and the December 1 protests I observed were the most violent. 

According to French police, it involved about 136,000 protestors with 268 people arrested. By the time I went to the airport, I could hear the water cannons firing, sirens wailing. On my phone, I was watching cars burning.
 
These protests are different because the people behind them are decentralized: organized on social media, largely Facebook, where disinformation is also misleading and fueling the anger.

After I got back to the hotel, the decision was simple. So I went through the worst case scenario step-by-step and prepared myself mentally and packed my bags. 

We are at the tip of the arrow globally fighting for the rule of law, holding government to account.
 
Again, here are my 6 calls for action to protect democracies around the world. As for us, we’ll continue calling a spade a spade.
 
Call me naïve, but this is the Philippines I know: a country that signed on to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and where principles and values matter.

56,Maria A. Ressa,"Starting on July 23, I’ll share some of what’s important to me personally, developments here and around the world that we should be keeping track of. It is my attempt to understand the world today.
I have a favorite Yeats poem that I keep repeating every time I feel that I’m living history. The last time I recited it nearly every day was through 13 days in May of 1998, days that turned Indonesia upside down and ended nearly 32 years of Suharto’s strongman rule.

I hear it again now.

Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

The best lack all conviction, while the worst

Are full of passionate intensity.

I’m alarmed by the seemingly drastic change of values that’s been catalyzed by technology.

Seemingly overnight, Filipinos turned from defending human rights to justifying – and worse, accepting – daily murders of innocent people. Or the impunity of power – both in the public and private sectors: the lack of due process and accountability; the exponential flood of lies that’s slowly chipping away at our collective self-worth and our imperfect democracy.

One of the first advocates and users of social media for social good, I am horrified by how it has been used by autocratic governments around the world to roll back democracy and press freedom – to stifle critical voices and increase sexism and misogyny by targeting women at least 3x more.

I am saddened by how social media has changed society, creating pancake people – flat and thin on real knowledge, powered by emotion, making all of us more susceptible to disinformation, which is slowly but surely helping shift the global geopolitical power balance.

On so many fronts, I see power using scorched-earth policies to gain more power, with an utter lack of disregard for the scars their tactics leave behind.

Yet, I remain optimistic – a hope that’s based on the idea that with clarity of thought and deep study, we can find the path forward through this time of creative destruction. 





How? I don’t know.

But it begins with one – me, you … the people we love. To get to that place of solitude and contemplation backed by research and real knowledge.

Brave New World is where I write not as a journalist, but as just me – my attempt to understand the world around me, hoping to find the best way to hold on to the values that define who I am. 

Starting next Monday, July 23, I’ll share some of what’s important to me personally, developments here and around the world that we should be keeping track of.

And here’s the fun part: I want to do this on email – kind of a back-to-the-future exploration.

I’d love to hear what you think. It’s a time when we need to ask questions in a safe environment and to once again use the power of technology to build communities that build, not destroy.

So if you’re worried about some of the same issues, join me and let’s see if we can find a solution together!",0
57,Maria A. Ressa,"Like many, I fear that the pendulum of democracy is swinging the other way globally, enabled by social media,' says Maria Ressa when she accepted the National Democracy Institute's W. Averell Harriman Democracy Award on November 2 (US time)
We at Rappler are extremely thankful that on this day, the International Day to End Impunity Against Journalists, our work and our struggles are being recognized by the National Democratic Institute here in the United States and, just a few hours earlier, in Amsterdam by the Free Press Unlimited.

I’ve been a journalist for more than 3 decades, and as a conflict reporter, war zone correspondent, I’ve never gotten as many threats as I get now as a founder of Rappler. So you know we’re living through through a moment of history.

This is one of those moments, where the mission of journalism has never been stronger – and despite the online and the offline attacks against us, we find the courage to hold the line.

I’ve had the privilege to report on people power movements and the end of one-man authoritarian rule through much of Southeast Asia, starting with people power in the Philippines in 1986. It was an exciting time to start my career.

5-and-a-half years ago, we started Rappler with the belief that technology – social media – strengthens people power exponentially. And we rode the crest of social media adoption – growing 100 to 300% in our first few years – quickly becoming one of our country’s top online news sites. We scaled fast because of social media.

The Philippines is a Facebook country – nearly 97% of all Filipinos online (you’re talking about roughly 58 million Filipinos) 97% are on Facebook. It is our public space – one that – when Rappler began – truly strengthened democracy and empowered us. We were proof of social media for social good.

Perhaps because we lived online, we were the first to document the weaponization of social media from July to August of 2016.

Today, I watch with horror as authoritarian leaders in many countries around the world use social media’s exponential power to spread propaganda, use anger and hate, to manipulate their people and to create alternative realities.

Like many, I fear that the pendulum of democracy is swinging the other way globally, enabled by social media.

In the Philippines, the failure of elite politics to deliver democracy’s promise paved the way for the rise of Rodrigo Duterte and a drug war that’s killed thousands. I can’t give you the exact number because that certainty is also a casualty in our war for truth.

When we published our social media propaganda series in Oct 2016, we proved the online ripple, using investigative journalism to ferret out and show – for example – how 26 fake accounts can impact up to 3 million other Facebook accounts in the Philippines.

Right after that series was published, we were pounded by online attacks. For about a month, I received an average of about 90 hate messages per hour.

Data that we’ve collected in nearly two years show how disinformation was deployed by what we now call the propaganda machine.

We’re six months ahead of you: we elected our president 6 months before you did.

When a lie is said 10 times, Truth has a chance to catch up…but when it’s repeated a million times, it becomes the Truth – especially when it’s backed by online state-sponsored hate exploiting the fracture lines of society – among them in the PH, the gaps between the rich and the poor, the rural provinces against imperial Manila.

Journalists are no longer the gatekeepers to the public space. We’ve lost that role.

To the tech companies running their platforms, I appeal to you to take action – be transparent…to be accountable. You’ve built a city. Now put the traffic lights in place so that the cars don’t crash into each other. Stop the impunity.

We are seeing free speech used as an excuse for posts that incite hate and violence deployed against people like me – against the journalists, activists, and anyone perceived to be critical of government.

The excuse of free speech is being used to stifle free speech.

Rappler is not anti-government; we are not anti-Duterte. In fact, he recognizes our coverage of his campaign helped get him elected.

We’re journalists, and we will not be intimidated.

To the men and women of Rappler, good morning. This award is for your hard work, your sleepless nights, and most of all, your courage.

We will shine the light.

We will hold the line.",0
58,Maria A. Ressa,"I just appeal to people with integrity to vote for honest people, not to sell their votes'  “I hate corruption,” she said emphatically. “I’ll never, ever allow corruption to rule.”

74-year-old Conchita Carpio Morales spoke forcefully. We were in the new office of the Ombudsman of the Philippines, a position created after the 1986 people power revolt. 

In a country with weak institutions and endemic corruption, ruled by social networks and a mentality of ‘you scratch my back, I scratch yours,’ there is no tougher job than running an office charged with investigating and prosecuting officials accused of graft and corruption.

“There’s a lot of corruption in government: that’s the challenge we are facing,” she said, “People are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel – that the impossible is, after all, possible, and that crooks in government could really get punished.”

It’s a message I’ve heard her give in several public forums, including our most recent anti-corruption panel during APEC meetings in Manila in November 2015.

On February 2, 2016, the week the Ombudsman’s office released 2 key decisions affecting top officials, Morales spent about an hour and a half with Rappler to assess her performance and share her insights.

Here are some of her lessons in leadership:

1.  Create an environment that makes the impossible possible

It was the first time I visited the months old new headquarters, spartan in design. Huge imposing columns at the entrance reminded me of the Supreme Court, a stateliness that made justice seem solid and palpable. 

The downstairs lobby was an expansive white, and the elevator took you up to tall, heavy wooden doors that opened into her staff offices. The floor is shiny and white, reflecting a purity of purpose that at this point still seems more aspirational than reality.

Aides said the Ombudsman leaves her home at 5am to beat the traffic and is behind her desk working between 6-630am. She works Saturdays, too, and expects everyone in the building to match her work ethic. 

Her office has a folding door to a little enclave she called her “workspace.” It had a long table full of voluminous case files stacked one on top of each other perpendicular to a desk that had a clear space. Next to the desk was a wheeled pushcart that took away the case files as she finished them. 

Behind the desk and to its right were towering metal shelves also full of case files stacked on top of each other. Some were standing upright, others were horizontally stacked. Sticking out from each are white sheets in the center, presumably identifying them. I looked at the cases on the long table to see small yellow post-it notes interspersed with pink ones among the pages of each file.

This is where Morales does her work. According to its own data, the Office of the Ombudsman has a workload of 11,056 cases, including 8,715 pending cases from earlier years and 2, 341 cases filed in the first half of 2015. 

Of the total number of cases, 2,940 cases or 27% have been resolved: dismissed, forwarded to the courts or given penalties.

Morales said she is hoping to hit zero backlog shortly before her term ends in 2018.

2.  Insulate from vested interests

I asked her what types of public and private pressure she gets from people with vested interests.

“No pressure on me,” she retorted. “The only pressure I have is the pressure of work.”

It seemed a glib dismissal of social and peer pressure, but perhaps this is a natural progression of her career, fulfilling the aim of the drafters of the 1987 Constitution which created the Office of the Ombudsman.

“They wanted an office that is isolated from the tentacles of power – the tentacles of politicians, the tentacles of fixers who reach out to courts, to prosecutors,” she said.

A former associate justice of the Supreme Court for nine years until she retired in 2011, Morales developed an impeccable reputation as a tough talking, no-nonsense, incorruptible magistrate. Appointed by former President Gloria Arroyo, she became the first woman to swear in a president after Benigno Aquino personally asked for her. She is the second woman to hold the post of Ombudsman.

Constitutional lawyers speak admiringly of the professionalism of Morales. A former colleague at the Supreme Court spoke about how she avoided even a hint of potential conflicts of interest, choosing instead to lead a circumspect private life.

3. Take calculated risks in standing up to power

It hasn’t been an easy time, and she’s taken great risks, focusing her attention not just on the high-profile cases against the woman who appointed her as well as other top officials, but also within her own office where deputy and assistant ombudsmen now face criminal charges for extortion.

Her first challenge was the impeachment trial of Renato Corona, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court in 2012. Using a straightforward interpretation of a little known clause in the assets statements of public officials, she was able to get evidence of large undeclared dollar accounts by going directly to AMLC, the Anti-Money Laundering Council – an interpretation challenged during the impeachment trial by Senator Miriam Santiago. 

Unperturbed and unflappable, she stood up to her former classmate, who voted to acquit Corona. 

Two years later, she suspended an Aquino favorite, Philippine National Police chief Alan Purisima along with 11 other officers, helping set the stage for the worst crisis President Aquino  faced: the Mamasapano fiasco.

In mid-2015, she took head-on a battle with Vice President Jejomar Binay, and his son, former Makati Mayor Junjun Binay, which had her defending her position in front of her former colleagues at the Supreme Court.

She would win in a few months, suspending then dismissing and perpetually disqualifying Junjun Binay from ever running for office.

To see the lines she draws between her professional and personal lives, during that time, her son died but Morales said nothing publicly. The only way the public found out was because a photo was released by Malacañang when President Aquino attended her son’s wake. On Friday, February 5, 2016, she threw out Junjun Binay’s appeal on his dismissal order and upheld criminal charges against him and his father, who has immunity until after he steps down from office. (Because he’s campaigning for president, criminal charges can’t be filed if he wins on May 9)

The Binays have been relentless in their attacks, saying the cases are politically motivated and that Morales is under “the remote control” of the Liberal Party. She shot back, “impeach me.”

“I think I have the reputation that I cannot be influenced into doing this,” she told me.  “When I accepted this post, President Aquino told me, ‘I want you to be independent.’ To his credit, the President has never – directly or indirectly – interfered or suggested how I resolve cases. We always go by the evidence.”

She looked around the room full of files again, saying the biggest pressure came from the work itself. 

4.  Be patient and take the long view

Morales was brutal in her assessment of our culture of corruption.

“I don’t know if it’s changing,” she said. “I don’t seem to see any change in the pattern of our culture because the culture is still there. Perhaps maybe 50 years from now, and we’ll all be 6 feet below the ground. Perhaps in the next generation.”

We discussed the Priority Development Assistance Fund or PDAF, systematized corruption that funnelled government funds into fake non-governmental organizations with large kickbacks for the legislators.  

The exposés in 2013 ripped open Pandora’s box, showing a decades-long practice that was quickly declared unconstitutional and resulted in cases against three incumbent senators, five former representatives, and Janet Napoles. 

“How did that go undetected as long as it did?” I asked.

“Well, officials scratch each other’s backs,” she said forcefully.  “See? Because that was already a series of acts of congressmen and senators, and it was all manipulated by a certain group. And perhaps some naive congressmen and senators were caught in the trap.  That’s why they were all victims, but they were also conspirators. I’m sure they were aware of what they were entering into.”

“But as long as it was hidden it was okay because everyone was doing it,” I said.

“Yes, yes!” she retorted. “They thought they could get away with it.”

While there have been successes, there have also been setbacks. Like the game of whack-a-mole, fighting corruption is “frustrating” – a word she used at least six times in our interview. 

“Now that PDAF is unconstitutional, can the Filipino people get the money back?” I asked.

“We are supposed to have this petition for forfeiture, but the trouble with that is with all the publicity attendant to the investigations, by the time you are allowed to file the petition for forfeiture, the coffers are empty,” Morales replied. “Billions are gone because they have been withdrawn by the respondents. So it’s frustrating.”

Even attempts to measure progress fall short. Transparency International does an annual ranking of countries based on a corruption index. From 2010 to 2014, the Philippines jumped up 49 notches, but in the just released rankings for 2015, the country dropped 10 notches.

“Some people blame us, but you see, the Office of the Ombudsman investigates and prosecutes only,” said Morales. “They should not blame me. We only present evidence. It’s the courts which determine whether or not the accused is guilty or acquitted.”

5.  Find hope in tomorrow

When I asked her to describe her lowest point, she answered quickly.

“Lowest point? When Enrile was – I have to be very frank – when Enrile was released by the Supreme Court on a ground that he didn’t even invoke” – referring to how Senator Juan Ponce Enrile was released on bail on plunder charges, a non-bailable offense. Within two weeks, the Ombudsman filed a motion for reconsideration that is still pending.

“I was frustrated,” she added. “If I recall correctly, his being ill or sick was never raised as a ground for petition for bail at the lower court.  When I say the lower court, I refer to the Sandiganbayan. It was only, I think, when he wanted to be detained at the hospital that he raised his being ill or sick to justify detention at the hospital.”

“Doesn’t it set a dangerous precedent?” I asked. “Were you surprised?” 

“I was surprised, but whether it can be presented as a dangerous precedent – I’m not going to comment on that without risk of being cited in contempt by the Supreme Court.”

“Every leader has a low moment, right?” I followed up. “How do you keep moving forward?” 

“Well, I know there is a tomorrow,” she replied. “That things could change because nothing is permanent. So that gives me the impetus to move forward – to move on.”

Culture change, shifting accepted norms and values in a meaningful way, is a person-by-person battle. 

The May 9 elections for more than 80,000 officials can either be a sprint forward or a slide downward eroding hard-won successes in the battle against corruption. 

“I just appeal to people with integrity to vote for honest people, not to sell their votes,” Morales said. “If the leaders are corrupt, what will prevent the underlings from committing corruption? But if the leader is not corrupt, the subordinate officials will have fear, or have difficulty committing corruption.”",0
59,Maria A. Ressa,"If you have the ambition to run for the highest offices in the country, you've got to let go of controlled conditions. It comes with the job.
On January 20, Rappler and its media partners DZRH-MBC, Media ng Bayan-PTV4, road-blocked up to 3 hours of airtime on nearly 200 radio and television stations across the Philippines to help give candidates for the 2016 elections a chance to present their platforms. 

After all, given the world’s challenges, we felt a need to move the public discourse away from the daily grind of controversial news clips and give the men and women running for the Philippines’ top posts a chance to face the public they want to serve.

Nearly 2,000 people filled the auditorium at De La Salle University, which had given their students the afternoon off so they could watch and participate. Before we began, I took the microphone and asked who were registered to vote, and it seemed nearly three-quarters of the audience I could see raised their hands.  

Add to this the nearly 40 viewing parties across the Philippines with AMA schools, other DLSU campuses, Lyceum – as well as the reach of Facebook and Twitter. We felt we could get a thoughtful discussion going. As the moderator, my focus was getting to the substance and highlighting some of the key issues the next leaders would have to face.

I was involved in inviting the presidential and vice-presidential candidates. While initially, all but one tandem pencil-booked the event in their calendars, I was disappointed when the weekend before, we received 3 cancellations in 3 days – the last one the night before. All but one tandem, Duterte-Cayetano, decided this was worth their time, and they postponed a crucial scheduled signing to be there. Davao Mayor Rody Duterte and his running mate, Senator Alan Cayetano, seemed thrilled to have the stage to themselves. (READ: #TheLeaderIWant trends, supporters take advantage)

Why would the other candidates give up such an opportunity?

There are at least four reasons, each of which presents both a threat and an opportunity for them in the months leading to May 9.

1.  Nothing is certain in the 2016 campaigns. 

It’s hard to be a politician hitting the campaign trail in 2016.

Old campaign rules – hitting the road, pressing the flesh, getting as many political ads as you can afford on television, harnessing a party’s political machinery to deliver votes – well, these are no longer enough.

There’s a new generation, and that’s saying a lot in a country where the median age of our 100 million people is 23 years old.

There’s an added twist.  

This generation is coming of age at a time when technology is disrupting every industry in the world, including governance and politics. 

Will these elections become our equivalent of the 2008 US elections when technology and social media catapulted a little-known senator to the presidency?

Is any candidate poised to take advantage of this technology today? 

What does this generation want? Comelec says at least 39% of the registered voters are youth, making that a coveted demographic, but they have notoriously been absent at the polls. 

When I asked the students at La Salle whether they were going to vote, we heard a resounding “yes.”  

Will that translate to action? Will they break the patterns of the past? And if they do, is that enough to overturn old power structures in our country?

So far, if we go by statistical surveys, the December surveys putting Vice President Jejomar Binay in first place reinforce the notion that the old tried-and-tested campaign methods may still be enough: press the flesh, solidify and pull together physical networks, etc.

That’s a simplistic assumption though.

Scratch deeper, and you find that context and recent events explain this – not just campaign sorties. The recovery in Binay’s ratings were also because of other factors: Grace Poe’s disqualification cases which stopped her momentum in December; Mar Roxas’ inability to sustain his momentum (even though he’s been doing the rounds like Binay); and the aftermath of Duterte’s cursing the Pope and his first real taste of how a presidential campaign is run at the national level.

Binay’s strategy of silence, which began after corruption charges caused his ratings to decline, tackles just one aspect of the campaign, but he benefitted from the cases against Poe (which other pollsters predicted). Despite that, he hasn’t fully recovered his base. 

If you go by Rappler’s informal surveys, the most engaged and active supporters in terms of evangelizing for their candidate on social media want to see Duterte for president.

2.  No room for mistakes in a tight race. 

The presidential race is too close to call. Anyone can win it, although some say this is Mar Roxas’ to lose. The vice-presidential race is as tight and perhaps even more exciting.

In races like these in the Philippines, forums and debates are difficult because one mistake can cost you the race.

Political handlers still remember the Harapan debates in 2010 which pitted the top two for vice president against each other: Senator Loren Legarda vs then survey leader Mar Roxas. Their performance ignited a storm on the then fledgling social media and effectively sidelined Legarda, who up to the debate was second to Roxas in the surveys. She was never able to recover.

That somehow helped dark horse Jejomar Binay, who had a relatively strong showing in the forum, to race up and ultimately overtake Roxas. 

Seeing how much was at risk and the immediate impact of the debate, all presidential candidates subsequently declined invitations for similar formats.

The lesson, I had hoped, was that candidates needed to hone their platforms and debate skills, but the takeaway from that for our politicians seemed to be to avoid them at all costs.

There is just too much at stake.

Until today, political campaigns try to exercise tight control over format and questions.

It’s a disservice to both the politicians, who must develop these skills, and to the public, which could be guided by a discussion on issues and see how their candidates perform under pressure. 

Real debates show us the candidate’s facts-on-file responses: unpolished and without aides and advisers. What’s the extent of their knowledge of issues and history? How do they react under pressure? What kind of values do they show? Ultimately, the crucible of a debate often shows character and shows us what kind of person we are electing into office.

3.  Is social media a plus or a minus? 

The 2013 elections for senator showed that social media could take a candidate down one or two positions in the case of now Senator Cynthia Villar, who faced a viral negative reaction on the issue of nurses.

Since 2013, Internet penetration moved from about 30% to 44% in 2015, plus smartphone penetration increased more than 200% in 2013 alone and is expected to hit 29.9% in 2016. 

There are about 42 million Filipino accounts on Facebook in 2016, and as early as 2012, SocialBakers estimated that 5 Filipinos open a Facebook account every minute. 

Given that the top demographic on social media are 18-35 years old, the exact same 39% of registered voters pinpointed by Comelec, will social media engagement translate to votes?

These elections may very well mark the tipping point for the Philippines, that so many candidates are investing in social media. Still inevitably, the easy investment is in trying to game systems – harnessing bots and other electronic tricks that could well turn the Internet into a wasteland.

So far, we haven’t seen any sophisticated systems that merge online and offline action like Barack Obama did in 2008.

Social media is a powerful tool, but it won’t mean anything if it’s not utilized in any meaningful way.

4.  Upcoming Comelec debates

Comelec is helping sponsor 3 presidential and 1 vice presidential debates, although these are largely left in the hands of the media conglomerates.

So far, it seems all candidates have said they will attend, but the risks remain.

Each step, including topics of questions and access, are being carefully negotiated. 

Having these ahead meant candidates felt they could mitigate the early risk of not attending last week’s forum.

So who won #TheLeaderIWant last week?

It wasn’t the public – people like me, hoping to see all the candidates so I could make my choice. There was a palpable thirst for real information: platforms and clear answers to questions that matter. 

During the 2 hours Duterte and Cayetano were onstage, I felt wave after wave wash through the audience as they answered questions in thoughtful ways. They had the time to convince, and they acted like a tandem.

If you have the ambition to run for the highest offices in the country, you’ve got to let go of controlled conditions. It comes with the job.

In order to win, you’ve got to show up. ",0
60,Maria A. Ressa,"The enemy isn't out there. 'I hope I will never reach the stage when I become the ogre,' says RADM Suarez.
It was a thought-provoking conversation about change in our society, an admission that our generation has largely failed, and that change would be led by this generation.

While waiting for the wedding of TV reporter Pia Gutierrez to naval officer Errol Dela Cruz on December 26, I chatted with my partner in the procession: Rear Admiral Jose Renan Suarez of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

 

He had a quiet strength that showed a passion fueling his faith in the future – necessary for his job as the head of the Naval Education and Training Command.

We spoke about a shared focus: the ongoing battle against corruption, instilling a code of ethics, providing a clear mission, and encouraging strategic thinking – for his officers and our journalists. [Disclosure: I sit on the board of the Philippine Navy.]

We discussed problems in organizational development: breaking feudal structures of management; empowering marginalized voices; creating a culture of excellence and meritocracy; encouraging entrepreneurship and accountability. 

Over the next half hour, we spoke about what drew both of us to this couple and their wedding: the idealism of youth and our hope for change in the next generation.

 

He spoke so eloquently that I asked if I could do an interview about leadership on video, and while he said yes, it’s a shadow of our conversation. With the camera on, he became stilted and retreated into “safe” language, but our conversation stayed with me for days.

We talked about the lure of power, and when I asked him how he keeps his ideals, Suarez replied, “I hope I will never reach the stage when I become the ogre.”

Then he told me a story. 

The Ogre that Never Dies

Once upon a time in a land far away, there was a village under the control of a huge and terrible ogre. Whenever he wanted to, the ogre raped, pillaged and stole whatever he wanted. 

Every year, one champion challenged him, and every year the ogre reigned supreme. The champions would just disappear. The ogre would be especially hard on the villagers after he won the annual battle. All the poor people could do was cower in fear.

Seeing the destruction, two brothers decided they would bring down the ogre once and for all. They trained long and hard.

Then the elder brother challenged the ogre. It was a long battle, but the ogre emerged victorious. That year, the ogre was especially vicious on the villagers.

The younger brother mourned the death of his brother, and vowed he would avenge his death and liberate his village.

That pushed him to train even harder because when it was his turn to fight, he wanted to be ready. The villagers saw how hard he trained, and that began to spark hope that someday, the reign of the ogre would end.

Their battle lasted for 3 days. At the end, exhausted and bleeding, he swung his axe one final time, closed his eyes, and killed the terrible ogre. 

It took him a few minutes to catch his breath. Then he looked at the body of the ogre he vanquished. 

The hair began to fall off, and to his horror, he watched the ogre’s body transform into his brother. 

He sat in shock as he saw his axe blade sticking out of his brother’s body.

He picked up the ogre’s axe, and he felt the electricity of power surge through his body. He dropped it and vowed never to pick it up again.

It turns out that the champions win every year, but the lure of power turns them into the ogre, who rapes, pillages, and steals holding the village under a vicious reign. 

The champions didn’t die. They just turned into the ogre.

There are different versions of this parable: Suarez said they were brothers; others say they were friends. Some say the winner becomes the ogre; Suarez said they had a choice. 

The lesson is the same: that the enemy isn’t out there, it’s in you, and that power is so tempting few can resist its lure – especially when you enjoy its fringe benefits.

Suarez said as he rose up the ranks, he avoided the trappings of power: for example, he drove himself to the wedding, and he doesn’t have an aide. I understood that: I live within my means; avoid borrowing against the future. That’s allowed me to quit high-paying corporate jobs, and while I make a fraction of what I used to make, my ideals are intact. 

The enemy is within. 

As we go into the 2016 elections, these are the leaders I will be voting for: the men and women who have slayed the enemy within – who are self-aware enough to draw the lines they will never cross…before the lure of power can turn them into the ogre that never dies.",0
61,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Clear from the genealogy of PhilHealth is its continuing mandate to provide comprehensive and equitable health care. Policy-wise, there should be no more question that aside from quality education, effective public health is a good “strategy for bringing about faster economic development and improving quality of life.” It’s a direct, and no doubt, quick route to higher labor productivity and economic growth.

PhilHealth descended from martial law’s Medicare as administered by the Philippine Medical Care Commission pursuant to the Philippine Medical Care Act of 1969. Total coverage of medical services according to the needs of patients is its ultimate goal.  It was to be an evolving extension of medical care to all residents based obviously on the nation’s financial capability by mandating contribution to help build the medical care fund. 

The basic idea was first to leverage on both the SSS and GSIS medical programs while preparing to cover non-members on a compulsory and automatic basis. Not bad for a developing country in the late 1960s.

A National Health Insurance Program was established in 1995, mandating the creation of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and replacing the Commission as administrator. This law proceeds from the 1987 constitutional mandate for “an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all people at affordable cost.”

For the same reason, the Universal Healthcare (UHC) Law of 2019 automatically enrolled in PhilHealth all Filipino citizens, including overseas Filipino workers. This means any Filipino can avail himself of health care benefits even without a PhilHealth ID card. There is no better way to institutionalize universal health care than through a contributory health insurance scheme.

Yes, the operative words are accessibility and affordability. 

All citizens shall have access to health services at first “with at least a basic minimum package of health insurance benefits.” The law prioritizes a person’s health needs than his ability to pay based on the principle of risk sharing among various income and age groups. There is also unequivocal mandate for PhilHealth to contain cost to help the people afford healthcare services.

Since not every one of the 113-million Filipinos contributes to the fund, and medical cost is rising like crazy, health premium is not just enough even if it was recently jacked up. With a broad coverage of inpatient care, among others, budget support is essential. Funding is short even with contributions from PCSO and PAGCOR and from the budget itself of the Department of Health. 

For 2024, PhilHealth received more than a hundred-billion-peso budget to accommodate an expanded pool of beneficiaries and to sustain current programs. Some 1.31 million indigent and financially incapable patients are to receive medical assistance. With parallel efforts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other government programs, some 12.75 million indigent members are expected to be reached this year. 

This is far from universal even as the intent is. 

If past WHO data were to be a guide, PhilHealth has a lot of homework to do. With sustained population growth, life expectancy in the Philippines surprisingly declined from 69 years in 2000 to 66.4 years in 2021. In Western Pacific, comparable data actually rose from 72.4 years to 77.4 years. In this age, tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death for children below five. Why, this is a scourge of highly impoverished nations.

And if this is not enough, based on statistics from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the healthcare continues to be a big burden for households. Their out-of-pocket payment had the biggest share of 44.5 percent among the health care funding schemes in 2023, higher than government and voluntary healthcare system.

Comparing the Philippines with other ASEAN neighbors in terms of critical health outcome shows some embarrassing results. Three years ago, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies in a study prepared by research fellow Valerie Gilbert T. Ulip and research analyst Lyle Daryll D. Casas ('Regional Health Integration and Cooperation in the Philippines') concluded that we fell behind our ASEAN counterparts. Normally, health systems must have sufficient health facilities offering different types and levels of health services. 

This is not the case for the Philippines.

For instance, hospital beds are limited, short of 400,000 beds. Half of the Filipinos have no timely access to primary healthcare facilities. We spend only about 1.5 percent of GDP to health, really no comparison with Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Our handicap in health human resources is just enormous. Ten percent of our rural units have only one doctor each while many health facilities do not even have a nurse or a midwife. Finally, our public health capacity for emergencies is extremely low. WHO’s international health regulations gave us a score of only 53 percent, only better than Lao PDR and Cambodia.

No AI is necessary to draw the extent of the challenge for the health sector in the Philippines. There is so much ground to flesh out the universality, accessibility and affordability of healthcare system. 

Adding the regular contributions of members to subsidies from the national government and remittances from both PCSO and PAGCOR yields big, big shortfall. Yet, PhilHealth failed to spend all its money in 2024 to the tune of ₱89.9 billion. 

With dwindling fiscal space and burgeoning public debt that has exceeded the threshold of 60 percent of GDP against the commitment of NG to refrain from introducing new taxes or imposing higher taxes, the only recourse of government is to increase the dividend rate and sweep all “unused funds” from government-owned and controlled corporations.

Finance Secretary Ralph Recto was recently quoted by ABS-CBN News saying that the full remittance and appropriate use of PhilHealth’s ₱89.9 billion could add 0.88 ppts to national output and add 600,000 more jobs. Interesting quote, but first, can the remittance be properly done and second, how does one convert it to output and jobs? (To be continued)",0
62,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"As we suggested in our last column, it is no secret that the Philippines’ official sports program is not perfect. 

The first known government sports organization was the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF) in 1911, which was formed only to resolve what was then the ongoing “menace of professionalism” and erosion in Philippine sports. Around 50 years later, in the 1960s, the Association for the Advancement of Amateur Athletic (AAAA) came into being. 

Under martial law, Presidential Decree No. 604 established the Department of Youth and Sports Development in 1974 and abolished the PAAF, transferring all its resources and functions to the Department. Later renamed Ministry of Youth and Sports Development in 1979, it was mandated under Letter of Instruction No. 955 to implement Project Gintong Alay (PGA).

PGA sought to put under one roof all development programs of athletics, first for track and field, and later for some other sports. Reported prodigies include the legendary Lydia de Vega, Isidro del Prado, Hector Begeo and Elma Muros. 

Aside from these initiatives, if there’s anything that speaks best of our desire to land in the podium, it is the 1987 Philippine Constitution’s declaration of the importance of sports in establishing a healthy and functioning citizenry. 

In 1990, with the significant evolution of global sports, then President Cory Aquino signed into law a new government sports agency with stronger and more focused objectives. The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was thus born to transform the Filipino people into “a healthy citizenry through various commendable sports development programs.”

The Commission’s vision is focused on one, increased participation in sports by Filipinos, and two, excellence in sports performance by Filipinos. Its mission is to coordinate and implement our national sports program, democratize sports access and training, and elevate the level of training for highly talented and promising athletes for global competition. 

Filipinos can bet that there has never been a dearth of sports projects and programs across the country. PSC lists in its website Batang Pinoy, Indigenous People’s Games, Laro’t Saya sa Parke, Philippine National Games, Pilipinas Para Games and Gender and Development Program. 

So, what ails Philippine sports, that our medal campaigns in global competitions have been sporadic and obviously incoherent?

Veteran sportswriter Joaquin Henson explained some years ago in the Philippine Star why the Philippines has yet to win an Olympic gold after nearly a hundred years of participating in the Olympics. For him, it was “an arduous journey of frustration, exasperation and disappointment.” At that time, the Philippines held the distinction of second in the world for reaping gold-less medals with 10, Malaysia being the first with 11. 

Henson cited the lack of coordination between the PSC and the private organization Philippine Olympic Committee (POC). Government is focused on grassroots development and yet controls the budget to finance national athletes. Meanwhile, the POC consists of the national sports associations that aim to develop star athletes but is undermined by reported politics, graft, nepotism, and incompetence. We are no match to Thailand, Henson argued, which had accumulated more than 30 medals in only 70 years of its Olympics participation. 

Henson also blamed the so-called shot-gun approach in allocating limited resources to several sports, a clear exercise in dissipation. Instead, we need our sports officials to concentrate on niche sports calibrated with weight classification like boxing, judo, weightlifting and similar sports. It would be considered suicidal if we continue to spend feeble resources on sports where our likelihood of success is slim because the sports is free for all.

Funding is another reason for our weak performance not just in the Olympics, but also in the Asian Games or SEA Games. While the law requires the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) to remit five percent of its gross revenues to the PSC, or at that time, ₱200 million monthly, what goes into the operation of the Commission is much less than the required remittance.

Perhaps it’s not asking for the moon if we can also professionalize both the PSC and the POC; less politics, more action. If we can do this, the budget for sports could be rationalized and properly allocated. If the plan is intentional and executed properly, with scorecards and accountability, we should be able to see good, institutionalized results. We can finally add more numbers to our sports greats, those talents that can harvest golds and silvers in global competitions — not as a matter of luck but as a matter of course.

In the last 10 years, it was reported that the PSC received an average of around ₱180 million annually from the public treasury. On top of this meager allocation, the PSC also gets money from PAGCOR and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes (PCSO) and a few other government institutions like the National Sports Development Fund. With additional funding from the Bureau of Customs, Philippine Racing Commission and private donations, that could easily amount to nearly ₱900 million a year. While this amount can seem staggering to the normal Filipino, it’s peanuts compared to what other countries are spending on sports and their athletes. Obviously, this disparity in investment explains our suboptimal performance in international games.

Despite it all, our athletes’ podium finishes prove that we are a country of hope, and that our resilience shines not just during flash floods, but also in the international arena. If we could produce a Hidilyn Diaz in weightlifting and a Carlos Yulo in gymnastics, we must be doing something right. But we could surpass ourselves if we succeed in producing more Diazes and Yulos on a more regular, more systematic basis. 

Yes, we’ll achieve more mileage if we channel some of those prizes to our reinvented sports program. Our athletes deserve a better life after the Olympics, something that could hopefully inspire rather than slacken them. But a better sports development program that produces excellence on a more regular basis should always be the first best.",0
63,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Tik Toks have institutionalized the Carlos Yulo landings in his floor routine for which he was awarded a perfect 15. We see people ending whatever they are doing with Yulo’s trademark open arms, or a series of tumbling into their shoes. With a 3.5 twist, Yulo ascended the Olympic podium with his gold medal, the first man to win an Olympic gold for the Philippines and second to weightlifting idol Hidilyn Diaz to harvest gold from the Olympics. He surpassed himself by winning a second gold in vault competition. Some commentators and sports writers were convinced his ability is otherworldly.   

It is otherworldly because his sports mastery started in his youth. At seven, his grandfather, impressed at his initial stunts at a local playground that is the Paraiso ng Batang Maynila, motivated him to focus on gymnastics. Since they stay along Leveriza Street which is close to Paraiso, he had all the time to do his stunts and tumbling routine. Paraiso truly was once upon a time a training ground for young athletes and sports enthusiasts. In the distant past, it was equipped with some playground equipment and sports facilities including monkey bars. 

Yulo could have been born several years later and missed out on these public facilities, now rare in many localities. They should cost almost nothing compared to the local governments’ own revenues and national tax allotment. Local governments never seem to realize they could produce Olympic champions by spending on some systematic sports development programs that could just spark our young Filipinos’ interest and inspire them to get into the loop. One does not need intelligence fund to highlight the importance of this public infrastructure in nurturing young bodies to global competitiveness. 

From Leveriza, Yulo moved on with his journey with destiny. He competed in various Palarong Pambansa almost annually and won gold, silver and bronze medals in various contests in gymnastics. As a junior, he won mostly gold in the ASEAN School Games and Pacific Rim Competitions. As a senior, Yulo harvested more medals at the Melbourne World Cup, Baku World Cup and Doha World Cup, among others. 

All told, Yulo has emerged as a young and living sports icon. He is a two-time Olympic champion, six-time world champion with two each for gold, silver and bronze; ten-time Asian Games champion; and nine-time SEA Games champion. 

With Yulo’s short stature, social media seems more enamored with “the precision of his form, and the difficulty of his routines especially in the floor exercises, vault and parallel bars.” Nothing beats congenital mastery. 

As the nation awaits Yulo’s return from Paris, enormous benefits await him, too.

The Philippine government is giving him ₱20 million cash while ₱6 million will come from the House of Representatives. The Philippine Olympic Committee is also gifting him with a house and lot. What was originally a two-bedroom condo unit in McKinley Hill, BGC worth ₱24 million, Megaworld was reported to have upgraded it to a three-bedroom unit worth ₱32 million, with ₱3 million cash bonus.

As if these were not enough, Yulo will also be getting from different donors such benefits as lifetime free eating privileges both buffet and ala carte, free gastro consultations and colonoscopy, free engineering designs and free furniture worth a hundred thousand pesos. The Guardian reported that he was also offered franchises for a coffee and lemon business plus a ₱10 million brand ambassadorship contract for a beauty clinic.

Dazzling, but these acts of appreciation may miss the point.

True, these donations to Yulo, and previously to Diaz, would hopefully inspire them to do many times better in the next Olympics, and many more young athletes to follow in their footsteps. But we need more than that. We need to institutionalize excellent performance in world sports competition. Sad to say, the previous budget allocated to sports development by past comparisons is not even a 10th of what other ASEAN countries spend on sports development. GMA news once described the country’s sports budget “like loose change against the income” of boxing legend Manny Pacquiao.

In fact, for 2025, the budget allocated to the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was reduced from ₱1.156 billion in 2024 to only ₱725 million. This budget covers general operations, amateur sports, training and preparation for the SEA Games in Thailand and the Asian Winter Games in China.

So, whatever happened to the Philippine Senate’s Resolution that commended the brilliant Yulo for winning the gold medal for the men’s floor exercises at the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Competition in Stuttgart, Germany. The Senate also recognized the potentials of Filipino athletes and in particular Yulo’s achievement as a “wake up call for our government to focus and provide more support to our athletes” competing in sports where size does not matter. 

We recall what happened nine years ago when the Philippine sports contingent to the SEA Games finished a poor sixth, the PSC cried “lack of budget.” At the Tokyo Olympics of 2020, Filipino athletes complained that the Philippine government failed them. Even Diaz herself complained of insufficient funds for her training that eventually led to the Philippines’ first Olympic gold.

As Muhammad Ali once quipped, champions are made from something they have deep inside them — a desire, a dream, a vision. For Ali, the will must be stronger than the skill. A sports development program would build the skills of our young athletes, it is hard work, strong discipline and perseverance that would build their will.

Sustaining his will is going to be a tall order for Yulo. Aside from the easy life that awaits him, and this could soften him a bit, he will have to face the reported issue with his own mother and his final decision on the next chapter of his love life. In sports like artistic gymnastics, any small distraction could cost the gold.  (To be concluded next week)",0
64,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"To be sure, and we heard them from NewsWatch Plus, there were many “sanas” during the 3rd SONA (State of the Nation Address) of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Sana bumaba ang presyo ng bilihin. Sana dumami ang trabaho. Sana ipagtanggol ang West Philippine Sea. Sana ipatigil na ang POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators). The civil society demands a good scorecard from this government.

With a fine-tooth comb, NEDA as the planning authority should do the monitoring having been mandated to prepare the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028. It’s an excellent Plan because it formalizes a comprehensive roadmap complete with actionable policies and programs and sets for Congress an appropriate set of legislative priorities to address both short-term and medium-term issues. A good scorecard and monitoring system should lead to a good execution of public policy. Otherwise, the vision for this nation could just ossify on paper. 

We focus on controlling inflation because it remains the most urgent concern of the Filipinos based on the latest Pulse Asia Survey for June 17-24 and Octa Survey for June 26-July 1. Around two-thirds of Pulse Asia and Octa respondents rated inflation control as the most urgent national concern. 

Inflation is closely related to the other concerns like increasing workers’ pay, because higher prices weaken their purchasing power. Reducing poverty is also critical because prices are already high. Creating more jobs is a direct means of empowering people to mitigate their poor condition and weaker spending capacity. Finally, fighting graft and corruption is considered one big impediment to appropriate public policy to provide infrastructure and social services. 

Table 1.1 of the PDP 2023-2028 provides us with the baseline of food and headline inflation at 5.7 percent and 5.6 percent for the period January-November 2022. For both indicators, the target was set at two to four percent for 2024 and 2025. 

We consider three components behind the inflation management in the Philippines. One is appropriate monetary policy; two, is a set of strong non-monetary measures to manage the supply side; and three, responsible fiscal policy. 

On monetary policy, we give high credit to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In the last six months of the previous administration, the BSP was so behind the curve before it decided to tighten monetary policy. This was rather too late and too little. For as early as March 2022 onwards, actual inflation had already reached the 4.0 percent upper end of the target, with inflation forecasts also subsequently breaching their targets for both 2022 and 2023.

When the Marcos government took over on July 1, 2022 the new BSP leadership jacked up the policy rate by 75 basis points (bps) from 2.5 percent to 3.25 percent in an off-cycle meeting. That and more adjustments came, running a total of 450 basis points to address the surging inflation for both 2022 and 2023.

By December last year, the year-on-year monthly inflation fell within the target at 3.9 percent. For the first six months of this year, inflation averaged 3.5 percent. The new BSP leadership should also be commended for keeping its focus on price stability even as various quarters called for a monetary policy reversal in order to stimulate the credit market and stimulate economic activities. 

It is not correct to suggest that today, the BSP should have eased monetary policy because one, it is using lagging indicators; two, monetary policy has lagged effects of about 18 months; and three, inflation data masks cumulative effects of previous price movements.

In reality, the BSP sets its monetary stance not by looking at the past, but by looking into the future based on its forecasts for the next two years. Whatever monetary steps taken today would not be felt tomorrow or the following week, but over a period of about 18 months. Previous inflation rates are monitored because they are useful in discerning how the previous decisions fanned out. Finally, because inflation eats into the purchasing power especially among the daily wage earners among us, the BSP has to be stubbornly committed to win the war against inflation. Due to dominant upward risks, the BSP was correct in keeping its tight monetary policy until today.

After all, the impact on growth has been quite manageable. High inflation discourages personal consumption which accounts for around three quarters of GDP. 

Well, what the BSP could have avoided was its press statement on a possible early easing ahead of the US Fed that rattled the FX market and sent the peso past the ₱58 to a dollar exchange rate. Given the exchange rate pass through, and if prolonged, that could have some inflationary consequences. At the time, the BSP’s risk-adjusted forecasts exceeded the target.

On non-monetary measures, high mark is impossible. Food, especially rice, production is not sufficient, farmers’ productivity remains low. The ax should fall squarely on the Department of Agriculture, National Irrigation Authority, DTI and other relevant government agencies. We have yet to see a coherent food security program. No wonder for June alone, food inflation continued to be high at 6.5 percent, no farther away from the previous year’s 6.7 percent. Rice inflation remained double digit at 22.5 percent. 

There is an Interagency Committee on Inflation and Market Outlook. Its mandate is clear: address supply and logistics issues including measures to combat immoral and illegal profiteering. They have yet to deliver. For instance, it took eternity to get the tariff duties on imported rice reduced from 35 percent to 15 percent. 

A few words about public finance. There was so much in the 2023 and 2024 national budgets that could have funded priority infrastructure in agriculture and industry as well as in research and development, education and skills retraining programs that could have easily translated into higher economic growth and perhaps better supply outcome, something good for inflation management. Fiscal consolidation is also crucial because the fiscal space is slim; excessive spending could reignite higher demand pressure. This could compromise price stability. For this metric, fair score is fair.

65,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"The IMF’s Tobias Adrian talked about 10 metrics aimed at helping central banks (CBs) and policy makers fortify CBs independence. Adrian was quick to point out that “this is the first new CB independence index in 30 years.”

These 10 metrics are: CB governor’s independence from the executive; CB’s governing body’s independence from the executive; budgetary independence from the legislature; monetary policy independence from the executive; primacy of price stability; long-term direct lending to the government; short-term lending to the government; financial independence; lending outside the financial system; state audit bodies role in ensuring operational efficiency of CBs.

He admitted to his audience at the Bank of Thailand in mid-June that many of these self-explanatory metrics are based on existing indices with new variables introduced including financial and budgetary independence, board composition, and the role of state audit bodies. Based on the views of central bankers themselves, Adrian stressed that the most critical component of CB independence is financial independence. To them, the least important is short-term lending to the government.

In the Philippines, one can only imagine what would happen to the independence of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) if it were to ask Congress for annual appropriation, or seek additional capital. Members of Congress could even investigate the Monetary Board why it has kept interest rate steady for more than a year, or closed an erring bank with strong political backing. 

Good, the 1987 Philippine Constitution explicitly mandated the establishment of an independent central monetary authority and implemented by Republic Act (RA) 7653 of June 14, 1993 by establishing a new autonomous and independent BSP in the same year. After a quarter of a century in 2018, RA 7653 was amended by RA 11211 increasing its capitalization from ₱50 billion to ₱200 billion. 

However, if indeed financial and budgetary independence is most critical, the continued independence of the BSP rests on the complete capitalization from ₱50 billion to ₱200 billion. But after the BSP charter amendment six years ago, only ₱10 billion was added to the BSP’s initial capitalization. With the establishment of the Maharlika Investment Fund, the full capitalization of the BSP could be further delayed because the BSP’s annual dividend that should be reverted to the central bank for capital build-up will instead be diverted to the investment fund up to P50 billion.

But as Adrian would remind us, CB “independence is significantly stronger in the countries where inflation targets are more firmly entrenched in central bank operations.”

Weaknesses are seen at the level of CB management as well as in its budget and financial operations, monetary policy and the prohibition of lending to the government and outside the financial system. Since financial independence is considered most important, any improvements here can offer the bigger “bang for the buck.” He recognized that future legal amendments may be necessary but long and winding. 

Instead, he advised the use of several IMF tools requiring no legislation. The first tool is the IMF Central Bank Transparency Code or CBT released in 2020. The Code has five pillars consisting of transparency in governance, policies, operations, outcome and official relations. Each pillar consists of various components that could guide CBs improve their transparency and communication practices that lead to policy credibility. 

The second tool is stress testing CBs’ balance sheets. Doing this will help them assess their own financial independence. As Adrian clarified, this is particularly helpful for many advanced, and for that matter even emerging, countries that expanded their respective balance sheets due to the exigencies of the pandemic. This should also be useful for CBs with large and active foreign exchange operations that expose them to interest rate and duration risks on their FX securities. Such risks should be properly considered in CB capital policies.

A quote from Adrian should resonate too many CBs “…a deteriorating CB balance sheet would negatively affect profit distribution — ultimately creating fiscal risks, including through the possibility of having to recapitalize the CB.”

We dread the day when CBs have to lobby with their parliaments for additional capitalization. They would be forced to bite the political bullet. 

The last tool is the CB operational efficiency review. This should require the CBs to rationalize their operational costs to achieve efficiency. Policy-related costs are left out but other costs including staffing, procurement, and other logistics costs are benchmarked against best practices. This will encourage CBs to avoid unnecessary expenses especially in staffing and procurement which may be subject to corruption.

While Adrian referred to the 10 metrics as the first in 30 years, an interesting article came out from the World Bank on “Measuring the Independence of Central Banks and Its Effect on Policy Outcomes” by Alex Cukierman, Steven Webb and Bilin Neyapti 32 years ago in 1992. They developed four measures: legal index; rate of turnover of CB governors; index based on a questionnaire answered by specialists in 23 countries; and an aggregation of the legal index and the rate of turnover. 

Their interesting finding: legal independence is not inversely proportional to inflation in developing countries but it is the rate of turnover of CB governors which turned out to be a better proxy for CB independence. 

We cannot therefore resist the temptation to conclude with the World Bank’s quote of Arnold Lobel’s 1972 comics: “Frog and Toad Together:”

“Willpower is trying hard not to do something that you really want to do,” said Frog.

“You mean like trying not to eat all these cookies,” asked Toad.

“Right,” said Frog. He put all the cookies in a box. “There, now we will not eat any more cookies.”

“But we can open the box,” said Toad.

“That is true,” said Frog. He tied some string around the box. He got a ladder and put the box up on a high shelf. “There, now we will not eat any more cookies.”

“But we can climb the ladder…” ",0
66,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"It was reported last Monday that securing an “A” sovereign credit rating by the end of the Marcos Jr Administration in 2028 “may be difficult as persistent underspending and the lack of reforms to improve revenue generation continue to constrain the Philippines’ growth prospects.”
These are valid observations.
Citing various economists like UP Los Baños’ Enrico P. Villanueva, Action for Economic Reforms’ Filomeno S. Sta. Ana III, and Ibon Foundation’s Sonny A. Africa, the report focused on the country’s public finance issues as a wild card, truly not without reason. 

We know the drill, and all the points raised in the report are worth considering by those in authority. For instance, sustainable fiscal position implies the country’s ability to pay. Thus, if the Government simply managed to spend what was budgeted rather than deliberately restrained public expenditure in 2023, and pursued critical fiscal reforms without sacrificing growth, an “A” rating should be more attainable. We were set back. The report also cited that the Philippines’ macroeconomic indicators have little to show for a possible upgrade. 
There could be more charity here because growth, while lower than 2022’s 7.6 percent and the six to seven percent target, was quite resilient. With inflation showing some downtrend with the labor market stabilizing, it was poor public finance that weakened whatever macroeconomic gains we have achieved so far. 

Improving the country’s credit rating should include efforts to improve revenue collection, address smuggling, reduce corruption and ensure efficient spending consistent with the development plan. Additionally, bringing down the cost of doing business and focusing on such growth drivers as tourism and the creative industries could not be more urgent.
About four years ago, in July 2021, the discussion was equally interesting. Rappler picked up on the question of whether credit ratings could be eaten. Such a question arose because Fitch downgraded the country’s investment outlook to negative while retaining its investment grade status due to the pandemic’s economic scarring effects. Some quarters raised the importance of even discussing the issue of credit rating given the deep recession in 2020 and the loss of thousands of jobs. 

ING Bank Manila’s Nicky Mapa, formerly one of our economists at the BSP’s Department of Economic Research, correctly responded to such a question.

“Yes, you can eat it, in the sense that it leads to lower borrowing costs, and the savings on that interest cost goes a long way and can be used for more productive needs.”
We were also cited based on one of our early columns here: “PNoy did his homework and delivered on his campaign promises on the economic front. Both the government and private firms proved that good credit ratings can be eaten. His bosses (meaning, the people) rejoiced.” I was referring to the upgrades between 2010-2016.

Fitch argued that while several buffers fortified the Philippines against the pandemic, these buffers were eroded by lockdown. The medium-term growth prospects and the dynamics of public policy were undermined. Regina Capital’s Luis Limlingan stressed that with the imperatives of the pandemic, the government might reverse policy reforms and court higher fiscal deficit and lower public credibility. 

These are all valid observations because they are among those factors that credit rating agencies (CRAs) monitor in assessing sovereigns, both emerging and developed. Two years earlier, in May 2019, we joined then Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez and then Treasurer Leah de Leon in announcing the April 30, 2019 Standard and Poors’ (S&P) highest upgrade of the Philippines—before and since then—to BBB+ and the formation of an inter-agency committee to pursue the road to “A.” During the press conference highlighting the presentation of Secretary Dominguez, we shared the key variables material to S&P’s credit rating process, something that we needed to focus on if we were to pursue the road to A.
First is institutional and governance effectiveness which weighs 25 percent. This should consist of quality and competence of bureaucracy, regulatory efficiency and control of corruption—all the components of public policy that impact on the ability to service debt obligations. Our latest scores in various aspects of governance compiled by different international bodies have mostly deteriorated. 

Second is economic score which includes the country’s growth performance and prospects, as well as labor market stability. This is worth another 25 percent of the rating. With various downside risks to economic growth this year, it is quite difficult to be optimistic on this score.

With the same weight of 16.7 percent, external, fiscal and monetary scores complete S&P’s general scoring. External score includes the current account position, exchange rate, foreign exchange reserves and external debt. Fiscal score includes all the discussions then and now on government finance—budget, public revenues, and accumulation of public debt. In short, it is fiscal overhang and debt accumulation that could compromise the country’s credit worthiness. Finally, the BSP’s management of inflation, domestic credit and liquidity are the key components of the monetary score. With upside risks to inflation remaining dominant, we might fail to meet this year’s two to four percent target.
Come to think of it, credit rating prospects may also be suggested by the headlines last Monday in another business broadsheet: “BSP sees 3.4-4.2 percent inflation for March” which means inflation has not actually been tamed; “Manufacturing activity further slows in March” which is not growth-positive; “February budget gap widens” which is a no-no in public finance; and “PHL Jan. debt service up threefold to P159 billion” which is bad for debt sustainability.  

We may not be able to eat an “A” credit rating literally but its attendant benefits like tighter debt spreads and additionality of foreign investments can translate into higher public savings, better infrastructure, more jobs, stable prices and higher market confidence.",0
67,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Let me share some excerpts from my most recent In Brief piece for GlobalSource Partners this week. I thought we need to do a deep dive into the latest twist in China’s bullying of the Philippines in the West Philippine Sea because of its economic underpinnings. 

It should be clear to all that we don’t claim the whole South China Sea; we are simply asserting our territorial sovereignty over that portion called West Philippine Sea that lies within the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as mandated by the 1982 UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea). 

The problem between the Philippines and China began with the latter’s claims and aggressive actions with respect to some groups of islands that are within the former’s EEZ and CS. We decided to submit this diplomatic rift for resolution by the Arbitral Tribunal which ruled that China’s allegations of “pre-existing historic rights no longer exist as they are not compatible with … UNCLOS.” China’s claim exceeded the geographic limits imposed by this law of the sea.

The Tribunal also ruled that China’s construction of installations and significant reclamation work cannot enhance a mere rock or “low-tide elevations” (LTE) to a fully entitled island. Rocks or LTEs do not give rights to resource exploitation beyond their territorial sea. Thus, Chinese activities in the areas of the South China Sea located within the Philippines’ EEZ and CS were found to be illegal. 

There is a new twist to this maritime conflict.

To justify its actions, China has recently claimed that there is a secret arrangement between China and the Philippines. It is alleged that under this gentlemen’s agreement, the Philippines was supposed to keep the status quo in the disputed waters. Only basic supplies, and not building materials, would be sent to the BRP Sierra Madre, the old Philippine Navy ship that has served as the country’s sole military outpost in the Second Thomas or the Ayungin Shoal. Failure to maintain it could compromise our claim of sovereignty over the Shoal. 

If this is true, the Philippines effectively waived its own sovereignty. The Philippine Constitution does not authorize any official to waive, even if temporarily, Philippine sovereignty or traditional fishing rights of Filipinos. 

China’s diplomatic authorities have also begun to talk about a “new model” in managing the standoff. Defense Secretary Gilberto C. Teodoro, Jr. denounced it, calling it as China’s attempt “to advance another falsehood in order to divide our people and distract us from their unlawful presence and actions in our EEZ.”

Finally, despite the earlier ruling that China’s construction activities in the disputed territories are illegal, China has been reported to have continued to build those structures surreptitiously to make it appear that the high-tide elevation is naturally formed, rather than man-made.  Man-made high-tide elevation is not entitled to a territorial sea.

Why is China dead serious about the South China Sea to the point of bullying the Philippines? 

Strategic control of the trade route could be a paramount goal. It is estimated that 80 percent of world trade travels through the South China Sea with a value estimated at about $5.3 trillion, of which $1.2 trillion is attributable to trade with the US. Beyond this parameter, China with its aging population needs to exploit the area’s vast marine resources, crude oil and natural gas to support its aggressive economic goal to leapfrog and surpass everyone else.

The overall impact on the Philippines is hefty. With its sovereignty over its own territories ignored, it will require the Philippines to seriously consider strengthening its ability for self-defense. Higher portion of the national budget would have to be allocated to strengthen our military capability. While putting up joint patrols with friendly nations and greater alliance outside the region are necessary, it is crucial for the Philippines to rely principally on its own. We have to do our homework in judicious budget management including the complete elimination of wasteful insertions and special fund allocations. Corruption can cost our own survival. 

The economic challenge is even more difficult. With the Malampaya natural gas field about to be exhausted probably in two to five years, some 40 percent of Luzon power requirements might be at risk unless the Reed Bank is explored, surveyed and drilled for natural gas and crude oil. The Reed Bank, or Recto Bank, is an underwater reef formation reported to contain huge deposits of oil and natural gas.

Several geological surveys estimated oil deposits at over 11 billion barrels of crude oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in proved and probable reserves.

If China sustains its unfriendly behavior, the Reed Bank may never be exploited at all, and with Malampaya natural gas deposit nearly exhausted, the risk of power failure in the Philippines is a great probability. Business activities including manufacturing, services and banking would be impossible, with enormous hit on the country’s economic growth. With power failure, and the probability of rising cost of energy, the gut issue of domestic inflation could resurge. Unless this is prevented, President Marcos’ political survival is on the block.

While the Philippines could once again file for damages including the loss of livelihood of Filipino fishermen with the Arbitration Tribunal and win, the victory could be pyrrhic unless the judgment is enforced. Justice Carpio suggested that one option is to offset the country’s official loan obligations with China by the amount of the arbitral award. 

Yes, it is best to settle this issue in accordance with international law anchored in upholding national sovereignty as well as regional peace and stability. Until the ruling is respected by both sides, China especially, the cloud of uncertainty in the economy is likely to remain.

The chance for peace is higher if the Philippines starts now to strengthen its capability for self-defense, cement joint patrol in the South China Sea and broaden alliances with friendly nations.",0
68,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"There could not have been a more inspiring message from the IMF’s April 2024 World Economic Outlook than the global economy’s avoidance of a recession in 2023. With a strong financial system, steady capital flows to emerging markets, some downtrend in inflation, the Fund equated the bottom line of these indicators to soft landing. 

One way of reinforcing the resiliency of the global economy is to build fiscal buffers. Fiscal buffers allow some room in the budget by higher saving, optimal reallocation and judicious spending. The need for fiscal buffers emerged due to the sizable stimulus packages and weak revenue collection during the health pandemic in 2020-2021. They led to bloated fiscal deficit and unprecedented accumulation of public debt.

In the Philippines, one can argue that the more moderate—6.2 percent in 2023 against 2022’s 7.3 percent—though still above acceptable norms, fiscal deficit derived not from intentional, strategic fiscal consolidation plan but from what may be considered cyclical factors underlying lower public spending. During the other week’s IMF Spring Meetings, the Fund recommended in general that “government focus on consolidation to curb the rise in public debt and rebuild fiscal buffers.”

To be able to do this, public debt would have to be reduced and debt service curtailed. These are possible only if more revenues are collected and expenditures slashed. Paying less on debt is expected “to free up budgetary space for spending on developing needs, social safety nets, and climate mitigation adaptation.” Fiscal policy is to be tightened in order to help in the disinflation process. It’s imperative for countries to dial back on their previous support to mitigate the pandemic and in the process help moderate public debt. This is the only way to build more fiscal buffers.
Are we building enough fiscal buffers in the Philippines?

Quite difficult to say when the Philippines created the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) last July 18, 2023 and decided to keep it going. Although it was claimed that the MIF offers us “an opportunity to expand our fiscal space for the government’s priority program,” it actually pushes the Republic to borrow money to compensate for that part of public revenues that was sequestered, or will be sequestered, by Congress to fund it. We are dipping into the same pocket.

Being explored for potential investment of Maharlika funds, already raised from the contributions of the Land Bank of the Philippines, Development Bank of the Philippines and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas are the expansion of Clark International Airport, housing projects in New Clark City, the Clark Integrated Public Transport System, the Poro Point Seaport Modernization program and the Clark Central Business District.

Outside the budget, these proposed projects can by all means be prioritized, and if feasible, partly funded by private money based on partnership. Funds from the state banks could have delivered additional financing for these projects. Properly tweaked, the National Development Company could have made similar investments. 

It is not therefore surprising to hear the National Treasurer announcing that the national budget would require this year higher borrowing of ₱2.57 trillion with a possible bloat of debt servicing in the succeeding years. Why, we are not exactly building fiscal buffers. We are intensifying the need for them. 

With public debt at ₱14.6 trillion at the end of 2023, we face the possibility of paying back ₱17.2 trillion by the end of this year. To be sure, this will breach the 60 percent to GDP threshold of debt sustainability. 

Now that the Republic is aspiring for a lower growth from 6.5-7.5 percent to 6.0-7.0 percent, public revenues are expected to trend lower. But there is scope for upgrading our tax system, expanding the tax base and enhancing both tax administration and institutional capacity. We hope our fiscal authorities can also explore what is now referred to as pro-innovation fiscal policy mix which is more likely to produce a more sustainable fiscal outcome in the medium term. This involves a simple tax system with broad bases and low rates with space for systematic evaluation. 

Imposing no new or higher taxes this year is hardly consistent with fiscal consolidation. More efficient tax administration, the preferred linchpin of the fiscal strategy, has some limits to what it could contribute to fiscal sustainability. Avoiding new or higher taxes could indeed help mitigate the people’s living conditions today, but in the long run, in the absence of broad revenue base, delivery of social services might be compromised.

Judicious use of the budget is without question crucial.

To support tax-less fiscal strategy, government-owned or -controlled corporations (GOCCs) are now mandated to contribute higher, from 50 percent to 75 percent of their annual net earnings as cash, stock or property dividends. Our fiscal authorities also planned to “mobilize substantial non-tax revenues from GOCCs’ unrestricted fund balances to unlock the unprogrammed appropriations of the 2024 General Appropriations Act.” 

True, these latest non-tax initiatives could reduce the need for higher borrowings and taxes, but the GOCCs could be undermined. To sustain their operation, it is not unimaginable that these GOCCs would also resort to request for additional government subsidies and yes, incur higher borrowings.  

With positive growth to protect, there is thus no other option for the Republic except to increase its deficit from ₱1.39 trillion to ₱1.48 trillion, or from 5.1 percent to 5.6 percent of GDP. Funding it by what is called “strategic fund-raising plan” anchored on 75:25 borrowing mix in favor of domestic sources is only useful to the extent of minimizing any foreign exchange risks. 

Yes, Milton Friedman once said that he was in favor of cutting taxes under any circumstances and for any excuse, but he stood by this view only “whenever it’s possible.” With rising deficit and public debt, it’s clearly not possible.  

Fiscal buffers have to be built, and built now!",0
69,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Not a few market players and observers were unnerved when the Philippine peso breached ₱57 to a dollar last April 17, the lowest at that time since November 2022. It was good BSP Governor Eli Remolona tried to calm the market by saying that those movements are something we should expect from a domestic currency that is on an independent float. Nonetheless, the hit on the equities market could not be avoided. The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) sank by more than 157 points or 2.4 percent to 6,404.97, the lowest in four months. 
At first, the blame was on the US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who was pushed in a corner by a robust economy and rising inflation that previous comments on  the possibility of an early monetary easing have to be abandoned. So, risk on for higher-for-longer US policy rate which could only strengthen the dollar against other key currencies as well as those in the region. 
The BSP was correct in refraining from currency market intervention because the relative weakness of the peso is regional. It will just waste precious dollars propping up the peso. 
Make no mistake about it, but there are fundamental reasons for this recent movement of the local currency against the dollar. 
That “higher-for-longer” argument for the peso trend to weaken is based on the need to protect that interest rate differential with the US Fed rate. The US remains a safe haven, and even if the Philippines is rated investment grade, the local risks from policy uncertainty and issues of governance are just too real to ignore. Those risks are fundamental. They can truly drive out capital to safe territories without as much of those risks. 
A weaker peso is a painful result. 
Unless the adjustment is sharp and volatile, and threatens inflation, no monetary action should be undertaken. Given those parameters, some currency depreciation is good for exports and foreign investment.
Geopolitical risks may have also added fuel to the fire. With Ukraine a war in progress, the Israel-Hamas war has shifted to high gear with the involvement of Syria and Iran. Their common casualties are the supply chains of this world and petroleum prices. For us, there is a potential upset of our overseas workers. Supply effects increase our dollar expense, while overseas workers displacement can reduce inflows of dollars, both of which impinge on the peso. 
Closer to home, China’s bullying of the Philippines in the West Philippine Sea has stirred up a hornet’s nest. After the US and Australia expressed support for the Philippines, the foreign ministers of the G-7 declared that “there is no legal basis for China’s expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea.” At some point, some American military officials even went as far as arguing that if casualties result from China’s use of powerful lasers and water cannons, the Mutual Defense Treaty may be invoked. The hostilities could be enlarged beyond the Pacific.
Bottom line: this adds noise to the market, increases the political heat and the currency market becomes jittery. 
Of course, the peso could only move within the bounds of its own fundamentals, but all these monetary and military shocks can and do amplify currency movements. 
Such fundamentals derive from the country’s external payments position. Except for 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, our current account position has been in chronic deficit. It was no accident that in late 2022, we saw the peso climbing to close to ₱60 to a dollar because our current account position sank to a shortfall of $18.3 billion, the highest in years, in contrast to 2020’s big surplus of $11.6 billion when there was no demand for imports. The peso in 2019 averaged ₱51.8 and in 2021, ₱49.2 to a dollar. While the peso strengthened to ₱49.6 to a dollar during the pandemic, it dropped to ₱54.8 in 2022 and further down to ₱55.6 in 2023.
There is no denying that the peso could also react to any or all of the noises out there when we see the political lines being drawn between two powerful political families, or when the Constitution is to be amended beyond the restrictive economic provisions, or the macroeconomic consequences of El Niño becoming more of a reality than mere threat, or the Philippines’ ranking in various parameters of governance, rule of law, and ease of doing business sliding down.
How do we assess the peso against the other currencies?
It’s quite problematic if we were to use simple adjectives because any statement that proceeds from this could only be subjective. 
One way is to check the trend of the peso’s real effective exchange rate (REER) which relates the local currency’s nominal exchange rate against two baskets of currencies, that of advanced economies and of developing countries. Calibrated by trade weights and inflation differentials, REER gives us a more comprehensive measure of the peso’s standing against these baskets of currencies. Higher inflation or appreciating nominal exchange rate increases the REER and erodes external competitiveness.
Overall, the peso’s REER appreciated in 2020 when the nominal peso exchange rate strengthened to ₱49.6, but depreciated in 2022 as it sank to ₱54.5. During those two years, inflation was at a low of 2.4 percent in 2020 and 5.8 percent in 2022. Since 2017, the peso’s REER has trended up, which means the peso was strengthening but losing competitiveness, and in 2022 it was weakening but gaining competitiveness.
Next time the peso sinks to ₱58 or ₱60 to a dollar, it will be good for our nerves to first check the REER. Unless higher inflation is risked, or the financial markets may be destabilized, let us not expect the BSP to be quick on the draw. It is more circumspect than that.

70,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Last Friday, we paid our last respects for Donato “Mang Nato” Gonzales, our loyal driver of 15 years. He started working with the family in his mid-50s but he stood tall in his crew cut and with a built honed in the gym. He had a stern face, he rarely smiled, but he was always soft with my two sons Daniel and Abraham whom he drove from high school through law school. Mang Nato was a model public servant, a loyal husband and a great father to his children. 

However, he was effectively felled by this blistering heat of El Niño. He could not stand it anymore, he took a quick shower and suffered cardiac arrest. He died on the spot in their bathroom. 

Mang Nato is only one of the casualties and future casualties of El Niño.          
 
For there are hotter days ahead of us.
The country’s weather agency, Pagasa, announced such a discouraging weather bulletin. “There will be hotter temperatures in the days ahead as the easterlies, or warm winds blowing from the Pacific Ocean, continue to dominate nationwide.”

El Niño’s scourge has been worse than expected. 
Yes, the likelihood of isolated rain showers and thunderstorms is expected to be high in Eastern Visayas and Mindanao but they are impotent in mitigating this extreme heat. No low-pressure area is in the horizon to bring in typhoons and lots of rain water to cool down the air somewhat.

But Tuesday’s temperature forecasts hit danger levels. Nationwide, heat indices range from 42° to 46° Celsius, covering key cities from Luzon to Mindanao. Our weather agency clarified that heat indices of 42° to 51° Celsius are considered “dangerous.” Such reading could cause heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and even death.

Are we going to see more Mang Natos out there?

Instead of the Department of Health, it was Pagasa which advised the public to prevent the adverse consequences of high heat by limiting outdoor activities, drinking plenty of water and using protective gears against sunlight.

Equally disturbing is the prognosis that this situation of high heat is expected until the middle of May. This means we would be seeing more suspension of classes and economic activities around the country. In the beginning of April, we saw hundreds of schools transitioning from face to face to on-line learning mode of the pandemic to beat the heat. School children’s health and wellbeing are at risk.

High temperatures and frequent extreme heat events also render fisherfolk and farmers at risk because they are the most exposed. Pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases may be worsened. Health experts explain that when high heat is prolonged, as what we are experiencing today, profuse sweating and extreme dehydration could cause body cells to rupture that could ultimately lead to death. 

A few years ago, no less than the International Labor Organization (ILO) announced that the increase in heat stress due to global warming will cause productivity loss amounting to 80 million jobs by 2030. Poorest countries will be the most affected by lower productivity, reduced economic growth and elevated inflationary pressure. Unless world leaders unite, we would have to come to terms with the predicted rise in global temperature from 1.5° to 2° Celsius.

Which brings this column to a recent paper written by our former colleagues at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Monetary Policy Research Group namely Jean Christine A Armas, Ranelle Jasmin L Asi, Dyan Rose L Mandap, and Gabrielle Roanne L Moral. These promising young economists found that the short-run marginal impact of a 1-degree Celsius increase in the country’s annual mean temperature could reduce aggregate output by 0.37 percentage point (ppt). The effects are worsened at 0.47 ppt when the runs are controlled for episodes of El Niño events. Thus, palay production could go down by 1.83 ppt and corn production by 3.51 ppt.

Manufacturing and services sectors are not spared from the negative impact of high temperatures.

Entitled “Macroeconomic Effects of Temperature Shocks in the Philippines: Evidence from Impulse Responses by Local Projections” the paper argued that such impact could remain significantly persistent up to the fourth year after the initial shock.

It should be no surprise that inflation is bound to rise with El Niño and this is something of a wild card in the overall assessment of risks surrounding the inflation forecasts of the BSP. Risk-adjusted forecast for 2024 has been adjusted from 3.9 percent to 4.0 percent when the March inflation further rose from 3.4 percent in February to 3.7 percent in March.

The BSP economists wrote that “a 1-degree Celsius increase in the country’s annual mean temperature could lead to persistent inflationary pressures up to four years, with a cumulative increase of 0.77 ppt in headline inflation after the initial shock.” Short-term headline inflation could rise by an additional 0.46 ppt and in the longterm, by 0.81 ppt. Food prices which weigh the most in the consumer basket are more heavily affected by the rise in the heat index.

With the protracted impact of El Niño, it would be a stretch for one to argue that in the second half of 2024, weather conditions would start to normalize and the government growth target of six to seven percent and inflation target of two to four percent remain achievable. Things should be back to normal.

Tell that to the farmers and fisherfolk, to young pupils who have to be dismissed from classes due to extreme heat, to riders who deliver food and other items who seek the cool shade of flyovers and whatever remains of green cover in the metropolis. 

Tell that to Mang Nato and his grieving family.",0
71,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"As we wrote this piece, the election in the US was likened into a woman in travail, laboring in child birth. In a few hours, the world will know whether it’s a Donald or a Kamala. The market believes it could be problematic if the US pivots back to narrow economic nationalism which involves bringing goods and services production back to the United States, or putting up barriers to immigration. Yet, CNN’s initial exit polls indicate that only about a third of voters thought the economy is in good or excellent shape, down from about half who said the same in 2020. This is not good for Kamala. This seems to confirm Donald’s claim throughout the campaign that the Americans are not getting a fair deal. 

 

True, if the IMF’s World Economic Outlook for October 2024 is to be a lead, the projected US growth was actually revised up to 2.8 percent from July’s forecast of 2.6 percent this year. But some emerging risks could be higher. For instance, US inflation is expected to persist and keep the US Fed cautious with its easing mode. Indeed, it is about to hold its monetary policy meeting this week and the bet is on a controlled easing if not an altogether steady stance. Interest rate expectations could remain elevated and the US dollar firm. These are not actually growth-positive. 

 

Funding-wise, if the US Fed decides to be more cautious — perhaps in anticipation of the potential fallout from the election — emerging markets’ ability to borrow and service their loans in the US capital markets may be at risk. As Fitch Ratings recently reported, the Philippines is among a few sovereigns who issued foreign-currency debt in the third quarter. The country’s external debt is now at an all-time high of $130.2 billion. 

 

For emerging markets like the Philippines, monetary policy could be most appropriate, measured as necessary, but they could also be driven by geopolitical factors like the US election’s collateral impact on their trade, migration and macroeconomic policy. Beyond these, there are pressing domestic issues that could downgrade their growth prospects.

 

In this country, climate change is causing devastation to both agriculture and industry. The Department of Agriculture recently estimated that El Niño and the series of typhoons and tropical storms reduced palay supply by more than one million metric tons (MT) for the last 10 months of 2024. Historical losses averaged only 500-600,000 MT. In terms of milled rice, it means we need to import an additional 670,000 MT. If imports foul up, inflation could definitely run up and weaken personal consumption and therefore growth.

 

These weather shocks also underpin the deceleration in manufacturing activity in October. The country’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell from 53.7 to 52.9, still showing an expansion but at a slower rate. A lower reading indicates lower increase in new business orders and output. Although the highest in the ASEAN, the Philippines’ PMI reflects some slight deterioration in any of the following: new orders, output, employment, suppliers’ delivery times and stocks of purchases. 

 

The other risk is fiscal space. National government (NG) cash operations continue to bleed with a deficit reaching ₱970 billion for the first three quarters of the year which could tip at between five to six percent of GDP. With taxation relegated to the backburner, NG has ramped up public debt now at ₱15.9 trillion, about three years of the country’s annual budget. For debt servicing, NG spent ₱751 billion last year, and for the first eight months of 2024, ₱915 billion or around 15 percent of the annual budget. 

 

If the Supreme Court decides to invalidate the Department of Finance’s directive to turn over PhilHealth’s “idle, unused and excess funds” that means NG would have less ₱89.9 billion from its funding side, unless this is matched by a higher borrowing. This is hardly growth-positive. 

 

With poor allocation of the budget — pork barrel, intelligence and confidential funds, and weak monitoring of flood control projects, and all that — we doubt whether the basic issues of human capital development and infrastructure could be given sufficient support.

 

Human capital is developed when we spend enough for education and health, and when we spend more for innovation through higher levels of research and development. Our own National Innovation Council, in charge of formulating the development of the National Innovation Agenda and Strategy Document or NIASD, is just beginning. The secretariat housed in NEDA has little institutional character and funding. No government can overemphasize enough the enormous value added of education, training, skills set, innovation and digital transformation in elevating and maintaining both the growth momentum and the quality of growth. 

 

Infrastructure, on the other hand, as represented by the government’s 13 flagship projects aimed at establishing physical connectivity, water resources, digital connectivity and health, has barely taken off the ground. As of March 2024, only two have been completed. The government should assure the civil society of the higher likelihood of the other 11 being completed this year even as the August 2024 infrastructure spending actually declined by 11 percent.  To be sure, good and quality infrastructure increases the sustainability of growth. Whatever shortfall in domestic investment can be very well complemented by foreign investment which would not need additional incentive to come and invest in the Philippines. With good infra backbone and people, we have what it takes to host successful business ventures. 

 

Already, some observers of the Philippine growth story have begun to forecast lower growth for the country. For instance, the Fund at the conclusion of the 2024 Article IV consultation announced forecast below-target growth rates of 5.8 percent and 6.1 percent for 2024 and 2025, respectively, on account of the expected slowdown in major economies and potential increases in commodity prices. The Fund, however, places some confidence that if properly harnessed, the country’s abundant natural resources, untapped blue economy and its demographic advantage could by all means secure for the Philippines a more vigorous, more resilient economy.

 

Moody’s Analytics broadly shares this view in its assessment of the growth prospect for the third quarter of 5.7 percent. It is not too sanguine about the impact of the BSP’s rate cuts because of the lag time, while exports may “lose some shine” due to soft external demand and slowdown in world tourist arrivals. 

 

While the issue between Donald and Kamala could be existential for some countries, our hands are quite full with household problems and challenges. Good governance could not be more pressing than now",0
72,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"We have been participating almost every year in the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Asian Regional Forum on Investment Management of Foreign Exchange Reserves, before and after my retirement from central banking in 2019. While there was some lull during the pandemic in 2020, which actually provided ADB with a new angle. In our spirited one-on-one session in Sapporo, Japan last September, the Bank’s Deputy Treasurer Sukhumarn Phanachet asked about the important lessons of the health crisis for central banking. 

There were many for emerging markets, but for us, the key lesson is the need for monetary authorities to ensure that non-monetary measures were also deployed in the relentless fight against inflation. Rapid price movement was not a problem per se during the pandemic and the year after. Inflation in the Philippines averaged only 2.4 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, both within target. We are all familiar with the story, why — the Philippine economy was literally locked down. Any imbalance in supply and demand was suppressed by restricted business activities. 

But the next two years were nightmares for both the central bank and the government. 

Both headline and core inflation rates reached their peaks, breaching the two to four percent official inflation target, indicating that both supply and demand factors could not have been busier at work. Unfortunately, while the BSP managed domestic demand by appropriate monetary tightening, there was some difficult challenges on the supply side. 

The unprecedented monetary and fiscal support during the pandemic did not elicit appropriate response from the severely constrained business activities. Firms were not fast enough to increase their output and meet higher domestic demand. Add to this mismatch is the supply disruptions in rice, onion, garlic, meat, fruits, and vegetables.

In all the press statements and forward guidance issued by the BSP in the last two years, the need for more strategic supply-side initiatives had been consistently hammered. Of course, like the US Federal Reserve at some point before that, the BSP was less careful in looking through the supply side. For that matter, many central bankers had thought those significant price movements of rice, oil and other basic commodities were transitory. Many of them held that monetary policy could just observe and sit out their ultimate return to more normal levels. 

We are wiser now, knowing they never reverted soon enough, and as a result, monetary tightening was deployed quite late in the day. The market had begun to factor in these persistent price increases in their view. Inflation expectations were de-anchored and inflation even got more entrenched.

In the Philippines, therefore, it was correct for the BSP to have sustained contractionary monetary policy until they were convinced of the more definite decline in headline and core inflation rates. With the emergence of new risks to inflation and the peso, we share the BSP position to avoid a more substantial easing. They can afford to be more patient in monetary unwinding because the economy has remained resilient. 

This narrative is no different from what happened and what is happening in the global economy today. 

As highlighted during last week’s Annual IMF-World Bank Meetings by the presentation of the October 2024 World Economic Outlook “the decline in inflation without a global recession is a major achievement.” True, the surge of inflation after the pandemic and the subsequent decline in inflation recently demonstrated what the Fund described as a unique combination of serious supply disruptions, strong domestic demand and geopolitical crisis courtesy of the war in Ukraine and lately what started in the Gaza strip.

The importance of supply dynamics in the fight against inflation was captured by the Fund’s research showing “an upward shift and a steepening of the relationship between activity and inflation, the Philips curve.” It was the tight monetary policy and labor market stabilization that bought time for those supply logistics to ease. Monetary policy kept inflation expectations hinged which, in turn, helped keep wages broadly aligned. In other economies, though, wage adjustments were actually overdue and the surge in inflation simply made it exigent. 

Is the worst over for the global economy?

If the Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva’s take during the press conference of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) last Oct. 25 is to be the defining view, there is now a good balance between confidence and caution. We can be confident that the global economy is more resilient than we first thought and that price movements are essentially stabilizing. Public policies tamed inflation without significant disruption to economic growth. But we have to keep our guard up. Caution is imperative because even if inflation is trending down, price levels remain very elevated. More people are getting poorer. The prospect for low growth and high debt exists especially in emerging and developing countries. Trade and finance fragmentation complicates growth as it is driven by wars, security concerns and competitiveness.

Against these new challenges, the Fund expects some policy gears to refocus. Central banks need to continue remaining attentive, always looking for evidence, to guide them towards an even conduct of monetary policy, that which is neither too late nor too early. We should add that correct judgment is also critical on the amount of the adjustment. Otherwise, it could affect disinflation or growth, or worse, both, even if perfectly timed. Communication is key to keeping inflation expectations well anchored. 

On the fiscal side, fiscal consolidation should be pursued at all costs. The problem is that with the extraordinary accommodation of the pandemic, fiscal buffers have thinned out. Since taxation is not necessarily the preferred route of many governments, many economies seem to be borrowing their way to economic growth. What is worse is that, and we hope this is not the emerging option for the Philippines, some governments are borrowing their way out of debt!

Obviously, there is no substitute to abandoning business as usual. That will never bring us the spectacular quality growth that we badly need. Large infrastructure deficit, poverty, and income inequality in the Philippines require substantial and quality economic growth. We cannot always rely on more and more capital and labor, and so we should aim for greater productivity and economic efficiency mainly through technological innovation. Most important, good growth is impossible if our political leadership cannot even solve the issues of corruption, and yes, floods!",0
73,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"When the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winners of the Nobel Prize for Economics in Stockholm last Oct. 14, the role of political institutions in economic development and long-term prosperity received some kind of a revival. It’s been 12 years since the initial release of the pioneering “Why Nations Fail.”

What is interesting here is that the three Nobel Laureates were careful not to be caught in institutional determinism. While acknowledging some limitation of their approach, one can get the impression that any subtle historical interplay between geography, culture and institutions, whether extractive or inclusive, may not be completely recognized. There is some scope for clarifying what time periods in economic history of nations are critical when building appropriate institutions. 

Which brings us to King’s College London and Oxford University’s Daniel Susskind’s new book “Growth: A Reckoning,”  which was released only this year. In five parts with a total of 11 chapters, the book in chapter 4 quoted Germany’s Angela Merkel who, in 2010, said, “We need three things above all. First: growth. Second: growth. And third: growth. Growth isn’t everything, that’s true. But without growth everything is nothing.”

If the Nobel Laureates stressed on the need for good institutions to generate prosperity, one that is sustainable, Susskind is quite sanguine about the role of new ideas in driving technological progress and economic growth even as innovation thrives only when inclusive institutions are in place.

Attaining economic growth is without question an existential issue at all times. Lack of growth breeds mass unemployment, poverty, hunger, and crime. Poverty and hunger foment mass discontent and ultimately, revolution. Susskind brought to mind the front page of The New York Times on V-J Day that says it all: “Five Million Expected to Lose Arms Job.” There was fear that after the war, millions of discharged soldiers would flood the United States from the front lines to look for civilian jobs. Without growth that was produced by World War II, unemployment was inevitable. The memory of the Great Depression was just too fresh. Full employment has become a universal priority. History shows that most of the civilized world succeeded in attaining economic growth even through two world wars.

And the list of growth benefits is almost endless. Extreme poverty dropped from eight out of 10 in 1820 to one in 10 today. Susskind even commented that growth “turned obesity, rather than famine, into the rich world’s main problem.” 

“Growth: A Reckoning” observes that growth could pose a dilemma. While it’s associated with many of the world’s successes, growth is also linked with many of its failures. In his article in the IMF’s “Finance and Development” of September 2024, Susskind argued: “The promise of growth pulls us toward pursuing ever more of it, but its price pushes us powerfully away from that chase. It’s as if we cannot go on — and yet we must.”

In the Philippines, while we succeeded in attaining robust economic growth in the last 25 years, we also experienced inequality-creating type of economic growth. Some have become inordinately prosperous, but a greater many have sunk into abject poverty. Growth has also caused environmental degradation. The need for more growth in the Philippines is quite obvious because of the economic scarring of the pandemic and the continuing deficit in infrastructure and social services. A growth of six to seven percent is hardly enough when viewed against these challenges.

But Susskind takes exception of the “degrowthers” who propose that if growth abets so much social cost, then less growth could be desirable. He believes that “growth does not come from using more and more finite resources” but from “discovering more and more productive ways of using those resources.” The planet is not the limit of growth, but it is the ability to generate new ideas that would lead to technological progress, innovation, and multiple productivity. 

As we wrote in a previous column in another broadsheet, we don’t have enough labor and capital at every instance to sustain economic growth, but higher productivity can ensure sustainability and with correct public policy, inclusivity. That should help transform the Philippine economy. If we wish to reduce poverty and mitigate income inequality, we need more quality growth. 

More specifically, Susskind proposes a few steps to generate new ideas:

First, the intellectual property regime must be reformed. To him, the current regime protects the status quo, preserves the monopoly and influence of past ideas to the present, all at the cost of those who wish to use and re-use them in the future for public goods. The current copyright law across the world has not been reformed for the last 50 years.

Second, more attention and funding should be committed to research and development (R&D). In other countries, the British economist lamented the sharp   decline in R&D in France, the Netherlands, and the UK since mid-20th century. US and Israel also showed some weakening in R&D but there has been a significant increase in private companies including Alphabet, Huawei and Meta which spend 15 percent of their revenues. With very little R&D activities, it is difficult to expect new ideas to be forthcoming.

Third, inequality should be reduced and people should be supported in their entry into idea-generating economic sectors. If racial minorities, women and children from low-income families are free and helped to invent new ideas at the same rate as their white counterparts, Susskind estimated that innovations could be quadrupled. Moral arguments have been posed but economics-wise, a society where a great portion do not do research and generate game-changing ideas is just inefficient.

And finally, technology should be used to discover new ideas. Susskind cited the case of DeepMind’s AlphaFold, which solved the “protein folding” problem in 2020. It can calculate the 3D shape of millions of proteins in minutes. With this capability, human understanding of various diseases and their corresponding treatment is now higher many times over. 

With technological innovations, we could grow more and growth could be greener and less costly. Growing the economy this way would definitely make the world “fairer, greener, and less dependent on disruptive technologies, and more respectful of place.”

It’s time to be kind to ourselves.",0
74,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"It was the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences that announced the winners of the Nobel Prize for Economics at a press conference in Stockholm last week. They were Daron Acemoglu of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Simon Johnson also of MIT, and James Robinson of the University of Chicago. They collaborated in working on the linkage between political institutions, economic development, and long-term prosperity. We have been citing their work in many previous economic briefings on the Philippines’ failure to translate its decent economic growth since 1999 until the 2020 pandemic into real progress and catch up with its ASEAN neighbors. 

In particular, Acemoglu and Robinson co-authored the book “Why Nations Fail.” In addition, they produced an earlier book, “Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy,” and later, “The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, and the Fate of Liberty” (2019). Acemoglu also co-authored with Johnson “Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle over TechnoIogy and Prosperity” (2023). It is difficult to dismiss such Colossal research work. “Why Nations Fail” was anchored on 15 years of research. But the actual research collaboration among the three Nobel laureate spanned over two decades. This is definitely not a piece of cake. 

RAND Corporation’s Warren Bas in “Washington Post” of April 20, 2012, about a month after the book’s publication, described it as an engaging, in fact very absorbing, endeavor to explain the persistence of poverty among 1.29 billion people in the developing world who struggled to survive on less than $1.25 a day. At the time, the average American was seven times richer than an average Mexican, 10 times than the average Peruvian, 20 times than the average inhabitant of sub-Saharan Africa, and about 40 times than the average citizen of such poor economies as Mali, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone. 

It's not about geography or culture. It’s all about key shifts in economic and political institutions that can either be inclusive such as power-sharing, productivity, education, health, technological advances and digital transformation; or extractive which include grabbing wealth and resources away from one part in favor of a few. Inclusive institutions allow the citizenry to participate in economic activities. It is one where people’s talents and skills are best harnessed by society. 

Think of Congo’s Mobutu Sese Seko who dominated the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1965 to 1997. He made airstrips of such an impoverished economy wide enough to accommodate the giant Concordes he rented from Air France. He exploited Congo’s natural resources, sucked them dry. His country’s economic and political institutions were too weak to deliver basic services to the people but just strong enough to secure Mobutu and his cronies.

Think of Philippine politicians who had exclusive access to the nation’s forests and mining rights, even black sands, who opposed deregulating the economy and liberalizing it to make markets more contestable to business people including foreign investors. All these years, even elections have fallen to the extractive control of politicians and the ruling elite fighting over whatever is left to fight over. 

Acemoglu and Robinson would contend that a combination of corrupt regimes, exploitative elites and selfish institutions, as well as weak state apparatus could only produce poverty and backwardness, economic lethargy, intramurals among the ruling elites. This is one sure recipe for failure. 

“Why Nations Fail” is indeed “bracing, garrulous, wildly ambitious and ultimately hopeful. It may, in fact, be a masterpiece.”

Bass was correct because after 12 years, “Why Nations Fail” is one of the major reasons for the award of the Nobel Prize. 

Whether we like it or not, the Philippines should have learned from their works. One reason: it was first published on March 20, 2012, more than 12 years or two presidents ago. Second reason: the lesson can be summarized in one sentence with two words “Institutions matter.” A corollary statement may also be appropriate, and that is the importance of property rights and the rule of law. And finally, the World Bank flew Robinson, one of the book’s two authors, to Manila to explain to the country’s economic managers, academics, and business leaders why some nations are wealthy, while the rest are dirt poor. That was 12 years ago.

We could have learned that if we maintain poor rule of law and institutions that exploit, rather than uplift, the population, we would not generate enough growth to address poverty and income inequality. Democracies, on the other hand, that adhere to the rule of law and protect individual human rights are the ones that could generate growth.

We could have learned that a reversal of fortune could happen to colonized states like those in South and Central America. These countries ended up poorer after colonization. Many of us in Southeast Asia are former colonies of both European and North American colonial masters. But it looks like in the Philippines, among the ASEAN 5, time stood still. Our colonizers established mostly extractive, rather than inclusive institutions that protected property rights, enforced the rule of law, educated their population, and encouraged innovation and entrepreneurialism.

We could have learned that despite its spectacular growth as a new model of authoritarian growth, China’s model did not impress the two economists. Calling China’s institutions as extractive, Acemoglu and Robinson argued that such regimes can, and did, produce temporary economic growth but only as long as these remain politically centralized. For them, notwithstanding China’s transition from essentially extractive to more inclusive institutions, it is “still saddled with an extractive regime.” It still plays a game of catch up.  Whether it will succeed or not will be seen in the next few decades.

When nations fail, and their political system guarantees that the elites remain in the driver’s seat, this year’s Nobel laureates proposed that no one will trust the political leadership’s promises of future economic reforms. That is why, no improvement, no progress is made.

When nations fail, and the threat of a revolution becomes more imminent even if peaceful like what the Philippines mounted in EDSA in 1986, those in power and authority would face a dilemma. To keep power, they would try and placate the electorate by promising future reforms, something that disappear when the threat vanishes in thin air. But in the future, the population would grow skeptical about those promises, and there would be no ownership of public policy. By that time, the only option available is to transfer power and revive democracy.",0
75,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"The photos of those who trooped to the Manila Hotel and other Comelec offices to file their certificates of candidacy (COCs) gave us the impression that they have all figured out what they seriously intend to do in the next few years once they get elected. 

We wish them the best of luck knowing that the current state of affairs in the Philippines is more than challenging. It is daunting.

For those running for national posts, they have to deliver about 10 percent economic growth for the next few years in order to reverse the deep 9.5 percent contraction in GDP during the pandemic. It is not enough to muddle through the next few years with the Philippine government’s maximum target of eight percent.

We need to grow more than our past because, among other serious problems, learning poverty rate in the Philippines is 91 percent! This means that nine out of 10 Filipino children cannot read and understand a simple reading material by the age of 10. This is a huge handicap because good reading proficiency is the student’s key access and foundation to learning in other areas like mathematics and science. Without reading skills, one of the SDG goals, ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all, will remain as mere aspiration for years to come.

As the World Bank reported last year, this learning deficit is due to our teachers’ lack of mastery of their subject matter and absenteeism. In its report “Fixing the Foundation: Teachers and Basic Education in East Asia and Pacific,” the Philippines’ teaching method was considered one of the most ineffective in Southeast Asia. Our classroom culture is far from conducive to learning. Our students are not challenged enough, they are not engaged enough. As a result, they learn very little and their socio-emotional skills as successful learners would remain undeveloped. 

Teacher training did not fare as well; they have failed to improve our teachers’ grasp of course content. In the same World Bank report, two-thirds of Filipino teachers had “medium-low” use of effective teaching practices, some 19 percent had “low” use and only 15 percent had “medium-high” use of effective teaching practices. No one was observed having a “high” use of effective pedagogy. 

If incompetent teachers impart knowledge incompetently, this would “translate into poorer learning outcomes.” It should be no surprise that indeed in the last Program for International Student Assessment (Pisa) testing in 2022, the Philippines out of 81 countries ranked sixth from the last in mathematics with an average score of 355. In science, it ranked third from last with an average score of 356 and sixth from last in reading with an average score of 347.

With severe setback during the pandemic, student learning was also held back by low teachers’ salaries, poor working conditions and weak career progression. These issues could explain another challenge, and this is the high absenteeism of around 40 percent among teachers not only in the Philippines but also in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam.

The World Bank’s recommendation on fostering systemic improvements and supporting all teachers is most appropriate but this will require money from the Treasury. Unless this fundamental problem of human capital is arrested promptly, we should be bothered by the quality of our political leaders at all levels and those who would be joining the workforce as lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers, and yes, voters in the next 10 to 20 years. 

Of course, we are only talking here about what teachers are expected to impart to their students in terms of information and a set of predetermined skills sets in mathematics, literature, science and even programming and languages. What is implicit in this exercise is that the body of knowledge to be dispensed is what the students would need in 10-20 years. 

But as Yuval Noah Harari in his 21 Lessons for the 21st Century argued, we need more than what he called production-line theory of education involving a school, with classrooms of cohorts, and teachers paid by the government or their private employer to teach. “One of them tells you about the shape of the earth, another tells you about the human past, and a third tells you about the human body.”

Since nobody for sure knows what the next 10 or 20 years will bring, change and discontinuity will indeed be the salient feature of modern life. And transitions almost always cause stress. Thus, as Harari quoted, some experts would rather suggest that we teach beyond the 3 Rs (reading, wRiting and aRithmetic), the 4Cs: critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity. These courses could provide our young students with life skills to deal with “change, learn new things, and preserve … mental balance in unfamiliar situations.”

By 2050, the world could be so different from where we stand today. The need to adapt is essential, and we need definitely to invent new ideas and products, we need to reinvent ourselves constantly. Harari could not be closer to the truth when he wrote that “as the pace of change increases, not just the economy but the very meaning of ‘being human’ is likely to mutate.”

It must therefore be clear to those who filed their COCs for the May 2025 elections that one major constraint to a more transformative growth of the Philippine economy is therefore human capital. Our educational system is a big failure and we need more than money to turn it around. We need thinking heads. The odds are just too great because beyond education, our health system is weak, just weak. We only have a ratio of 99 hospital beds for every 100,000 of our population, something that is a just a third of what they have in other developing countries. Out of over 42,000 barangays, 44 percent do not have health stations. 

These and more legacy problems of the last 70 years await the legion who committed to render public service together with their families and associates. It’s up to us voters to disprove what John Maynard Keynes once quipped: “Before the 18th century, mankind entertained no false hopes.”",0
76,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Two days ago, Oct. 1, poll aspirants started to flock to various filing centers of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to file their certificates of candidacy (COC) for 18,280 elective positions for the May 2025 national and local elections. Filipinos will be choosing 12 senators, 254 members of the House of Representatives, 63 party-list representatives, 82 governors, 149 city mayors and 1,493 municipal mayors, among others.

Public money from taxes and other forms of revenues will pay their salaries and allowances as well as those of their assistants and staff. Our people are therefore entitled to dream that these elected officials would use their mind to bring about new ways of governance, and they are legions in the annals of public management and political science. 

Will we ever see elections like what we do every three years adhere to democracy and better choices?

Our poll aspirants promise positive change with the moons and the stars, complete with catchy slogans and jingles. But alas, after three years for most, and six years for senators, they would prove that they are no different, they are the same old bananas! Rehashed, recycled, rebranded.

For the normal pathway to electoral victory is popularity. One wins because his name rings a bell, thanks to showbiz of entertainment and comedy. But political governance is beyond cracking green jokes and mastering street fights. And no, voters scarcely distinguish between real world challenges and staged heroism. They trust false news and cold cash on E day can certainly make up for the difference. 

Once elected, our filmdom legend could not even speak, or sponsor a bill on the legislative floor, or formulate coherent positions on key issues of the day. It is asking for a miracle if their kind could figure out how the hearings on Alice Guo and POGO operations could aid legislation, or the revelation on the role of PNP in extrajudicial killings could lead to urgent cleansing of the police rank. If true, it is mind-boggling how heads of public agencies could be eliminated like premeditating rat extermination.

Comelec’s posters claim that the May 2025 elections represent “makabagong halalan.” BAGO stands for better, automation, governance and opportunities.

Will this be any different from elections past?

It is interesting that mature democracies like Switzerland could still convene a conference to reinvent democratic elections. The Bern Conference was organized May 9-10 last year through the Parliamentary Assembly and the Swiss Government in celebration of the Swiss accession to the Council of Europe in order to “ensure democratic elections even in difficult times caused by multiple crises.” In attendance were over 130 politicians from Europe and representatives of Europe’s institutional partners and electoral management bodies, international organizations, academia and civil society. 

The President of the Swiss National Council, Mr. Martin Candinas, could not have said it any clearer when he declared that “No election alone is a guarantee for a functioning democracy. But a democracy has no legitimacy without elections. Free and fair elections are indispensable means for citizens to express their opinion and to be able to make decisions.” 

Very true for the Philippines.

While innovations, especially technological in the way Comelec commits that the May 2025 elections would be better and automated, promise new and more representative form of voting, the question raised in Switzerland is whether such promises could be delivered in the long run. The recent May 2022 automated election, the result of which is being challenged in the Supreme Court due to election anomaly, did not seem to deliver new and innovative political leadership in various levels of governance. The Filipino electorate, enlightened or not, would have the opportunity to change government composition partly only in 2025, and partly only in 2028. 

No different from the cheap gimmicks of the incumbents here, the Bern Conference also highlighted the temptation for the executive powers to “misuse the state of emergency for political gains as well as the important role of media which needs to remain balanced even in such situations, where incumbents are naturally getting more coverage.”

We are quite skeptical about this statement from the Bern Conference that indeed elections conducted in a true spirit of democracy could deflect tension, sort out conflicts and invest governments with legitimacy to govern. We need to define what the true spirit of democracy is in the context of Philippine reality. Instead of deflecting tension, Philippine elections have become famous for producing tension and even open confrontation. Instead of sorting out conflicts, Philippine elections actually complicate conflicts and increase their likelihood of happening. Instead of investing the government with legitimacy, thanks to electoral fraud and cheating, Philippine elections undermine winning candidates’ claim to victory and the right to lead. 

The Bern Conference also observed the increased use and dependence on ICTs, technology if we will, and the risks of manipulation of election results. AI and cyber technology are neutral; they can be used either to protect the integrity of the election or to thwart public will. 

Based on this, the Conference stressed the need to find new ways to establish transparency of data sources and algorithms; help people recognize when they are exposed to AI-generated content; preserve ultimate human control in essential decision making; and ensure compliance of AI-driven systems with best practices in electoral norms. We are not surprised that the Conference recommended that governments intensify the fights against disinformation and propaganda, strengthen cybersecurity and protection of critical electoral infrastructure. Disinformation and propaganda are the enemies of democracy.

Finally, the Conference raised the issue of public-private partnership in service provision. Private sector participants should be held accountable for upholding security standards, that their source codes should be secured and always available for public scrutiny and auditing. It doesn’t have to require, as in the Philippines, Supreme Court ruling to release simple transmission logs during the automated May 2022 presidential elections.

To further lock in the integrity of future elections in the Philippines, we may also wish to consider the recommendation to undertake comprehensive risk assessment to ensure our processes are sufficiently robust while guaranteeing adherence to principles of democratic elections. The Philippine Government can invite international organizations with formal observation mandate to help implement electoral standards and protect the integrity of future elections. 

Why, that could help prevent those same old bananas from wreaking havoc to our politics and the economy.",0
77,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Disrespecting the law is no less than an act of insolence, and in the “Law Insider” formulation, that is arrogant, presumptuous, impudent, or in fact even insulting. It could even be at once rude because it is no less than the Philippine law that is being crushed. 

What Alice Guo did was a shameless disregard of the law, call it contempt of the law. If true, being non-Filipino made it worse, many times over. Of course, no less disrespectful of the law is how Apollo Quiboloy broke it by refusing to surrender to the authorities, until recently, despite the arrest warrant served to him in his own kingdom. 

Unfortunately, disrespect of the law, rather than the rule of law, has a long history in the Philippines.

The American expatriate businessman Harry Stonehill broke the law when he bribed high-level government officials in the early 1960s. His case also dragged at least three former presidents in order to protect his $50 million business in tobacco and various commercial crops, among others. Then Justice Secretary Jose W. Diokno caused the raid of the offices of 42 of Stonehill’s business establishments in 1962 and the arrest of Stonehill and some of his associates. 

Based on what was described as six army trucks worth of incriminating evidence, Stonehill was accused of tax evasion, economic sabotage, and various other charges that could have been established by his Blue Book which mysteriously went missing. It contained the names of Filipino politicians and government officials who were alleged to have received bribe money from the American businessman. Before the case could be tried in court, Stonehill was subsequently deported by Malacañang.

Alice Guo treated Philippine law like rag when all evidence points to her faking her birth circumstances to gain entry into the Philippines and become a Filipino citizen. If she is indeed non-Filipino and therefore disqualified, she violated our electoral law when she ran and took her oath of office as mayor of Bamban, Tarlac. This gains credence in the face of Guo’s fingerprints being a perfect match with a Chinese national, Guo Hua Ping. Guo could not explain how she was able to construct the multibillion building complex of POGO business in Tarlac. It was impossible because her tax returns and SALN could only support a modest lifestyle.

As Reuters reported, even as Philippine authorities had filed several counts of money laundering, Guo continues to insist “she is natural-born Philippine citizen facing ‘malicious accusations,’ and had no knowledge of criminality.” This is strange because she could not even remember her roots, even her playmates while growing up.

For weeks before she escaped from the Philippines to Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, our elected senators could not get through her. It was a blank wall for them when Guo would always retort that she grew up in a farm, her only close friends were the farmhands in their piggery, or when confronted by documentary evidence of her true nationality, that she could not remember anymore. 

The bigger picture is the undeniable involvement of those in authority. 

She could not have entered the Philippines without the complicity of our immigration authorities. She could not have produced her Filipino birth certificate without the knowledge of the civil registrar and the statistics authorities. She could not have run for public office if our election authorities conducted a simple due diligence. She could not have sustained her POGO and alleged illegal activities if law enforcers did not turn a blind eye. She could not have escaped from the Philippines in July without official intervention. 

It's a sad commentary that even notarization of public documents could be dragged into this scandal. As Rappler reported, a lawyer “committed lapses when he notarized the counter-affidavit of suspended Bamban Mayor Alice Guo in relation to a DOJ human trafficking complaint on Aug. 14.” By that time, Guo was already out of the country. 

When she was finally arrested by Indonesian Interpol in Tangerang, it was disclosed that a Singaporean national helped Guo book four hotel rooms in Batam island. And to the surprise of many, no less than Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos and PNP Chief PGen. Rommel Marbil who served the Senate arrest warrant to Guo. She was brought back to Manila in yes, a private plane. 

There was little progress during the Senate hearing, notwithstanding the competent leadership of Senator Risa Hontiveros. All that Guo had to do to frustrate the senators’ spirited questioning was to claim innocence, short memory or the risk of incriminating herself. 

If at all, Guo even taught the Senate what to do and this was to convert the public hearing into an executive session. Only then could she disclose to the Senate who engineered her escape. When the Senate refused, Guo was persuaded to write on a piece of paper the name of the person who helped her escape. By the disclosure of two senators, another non-Filipino disregarded the Senate arrest warrant by helping Guo and her siblings and associates avoid arrest through the southern backdoor. 

Nothing should surprise us anymore when non-Filipinos have the gall to disrespect our legal and justice system. We ourselves have nurtured such a habit of setting aside the law and just treating it as an elephant in the room, and in many cases, too, as a doormat.

This is in contrast to what the Philippines aspired for a “people-centered, clean and efficient governance” in the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022. In Chapter 5, we as a people, expressed our adherence to a high-trust society where “citizens obey the law, they willingly pay the correct taxes trusting that government will prudently manage the fiscal resources.” 

Indeed, the cornerstone of a high-trust society is the trust in government. 

But we have doubt whether the plan to “enhance the social fabric by making government worthy of people’s trust” actually bore fruit given Alice’s tale in POGO land.",0
78,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"While we were rocked by the news of alleged irregularities in the use of confidential funds in one government office, it was as shocking to know of another irregularity in the procurement of laptops in the Department of Education, of all departments. As if these were not enough, the Commission on Audit flagged the same department over its feeding program. Audit teams found “there were either unsanitary packing, questionable expiry dates, or pests and molds on the bread meant for students.” The program was funded up to ₱5.69 billion.

In the last two weeks, the Filipino people also learned that evading jail term and getting away with it, at least until yesterday, is not only for the movies. The suspended Mayor of Bamban, Tarlac Alice Guo succeeded in leaving the Philippines presumably through the southern back door without any trace of departure from the country. Her lawyers and notary public continued to maintain “she is still very much around.” Her arrest yesterday by Indonesian authorities proves they were not exactly truthful.

Again, our law enforcement authorities have more homework to do when fugitive televangelist Apollo Quiboloy and his five co-accused in a human trafficking case remain at large for months after a Pasig regional trial court (RTC) issued the arrest warrant. The authorities also failed to serve another arrest warrant against Quiboloy subsequently issued by a Davao RTC over a sexual abuse case.

And yes, while the directive to sweep all “sleeping” funds of government owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) has been justified as prudent, one that minimizes the need for higher taxes or more borrowings, this broadsheet reported last Friday the successful launch of public offshore commercial borrowing of $2.5 billion, or at ₱57 to a dollar, more than ₱142 billion. For the first half of 2024 alone, it was also reported that the country’s foreign borrowings already aggregated ₱267.4 billion.

Which brings us to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) from where another $500 million is expected, or around ₱28.5 billion. This loan is dedicated to climate finance and is part of the $10 billion commitment announced by ADB in Dubai last year. That’s ₱570 billion aimed at improving the climate resilience of local communities in the Philippines. Investments are expected to go to public transport, clean energy, disaster risk management and social protection.

With dwindling fiscal space, we have no option but to pin tremendous hope on this program loan. So far this year, we have received two deafening wake-up calls from the country’s third tropical cyclone this year, typhoon Carina which literally punished us last July 24, and tropical storm Enteng that caused no small amounts of floods and landslides in Luzon this week. 

Contrary to the allegations of some, the problem in disaster management is not the number of appropriate weather advisories issued by, in the case of the Philippines, PAGASA. PAGASA continues to monitor these types of weather developments 24 hours a day. Execution of PAR plus five remains, meaning, the advisory covers the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) but expanded by five degrees in case a tropical cyclone develops beyond PAR. 

As a global community, it is our lack of sensitivity and response to the impacts of climate change including what the ADB and the United Nations in their recent report called “slow and sudden onset of weather events” that are compromising our ability, and those of other countries, in meeting the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While some steady progress has been made in enhancing food security, mitigating malnutrition and improving public health, more progress is absolutely required. The challenges of climate change, health crisis and the scourge of inflation are wreaking havoc on agricultural and labor productivity, loss of jobs and displacement of people. As a result, our progress in promoting food security, and reducing poverty is severely hampered.

We need to do more. We need to expedite the disposition of cases involving POGO champions and their escapades, or the unmitigated incompetence or lack of accountability of some in authority. We should avoid dissipating scarce public resources in favor of non-essential but favored public projects.

Thus, the report of the ADB and the United Nations’ Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations Development Programme, “People and Planet: Addressing the Interlinked Challenges of Climate Change, Poverty and Hunger in Asia and the Pacific,” released last February 2024 could not have stressed that message enough. Incremental progress, that which we are only capable of, is considered many times inadequate in achieving the SDGs of 2015 — zero poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, among others.

The problem in many countries, if not all of them, is that “global and regional policies do not adequately support the integration of climate priorities with efforts to address poverty and hunger.” We put a wedge between economic development and health, for instance, or disaster risk reduction and poverty and income inequality, for that matter. Some governments are willing to forego strong promotion of public health or quality education in favor of petty local infrastructure projects or expansion of government plantilla positions even as digital solutions are readily available.

Before it is too late, we need to put in our spirit that weather shocks continue to be more severe over the years, that their burdens are unevenly distributed to the disadvantage of the impoverished nations and peoples. No less than UN Resident Representative Gustavo Gonzalez who declared that the Asia-Pacific region, the Philippines included, “is not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.” If this statement from the United Nations two years ago is to be believed, SDGs would only be achieved in 2065 or 40 years from today.

In fact, the Philippine Statistics Authority earlier this year reported that for us, less than 20 percent of SDG indicators were on track, with nearly 30 percent regressing. With our poor capacity to roll with the weather punches, we cannot say more than that for our efforts to reduce poverty and hunger, as well as achieve quality public health and education.

While we spend time on other things…",0
79,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Last week, we concluded our piece with the quote from Finance Secretary Ralph Recto that the full remittance and appropriate use of PhilHealth’s ₱89.9 billion could boost GDP by 0.88 ppts and employment by 600,000. It is not as simple as deciding whether there are excess funds idling in PhilHealth treasury and all that is needed to do is to direct its remittance to the Bureau of the Treasury. From there, the National Government can earmark the freed funds to finance infrastructure and other social services. In the process, to the extent that government finance leads to higher spending on capital goods and hiring people, national output and jobs creation are likely to expand.

The fundamental issue is whether the ₱89.9 billion funds are indeed excess funds. Some quarters might wish to play technical about it but when decent healthcare in the Philippines remains out of reach for many Filipinos, the so-called ₱500 billion in PhilHealth’s reserve funds are barely enough. It is unconscionable for PhilHealth leadership, then and now, to even talk about profitable operation and reserve funds. Reserve funds are supposed to be used to increase the benefits or to reduce member contributions pursuant to the law. 

Higher benefits in recent period are an empty boast when some 44 percent of health care spending consists of out-of-pocket payments. While PhilHealth’s benefits have been recently increased to 30 percent, health care industry representatives claim that such an increase came only after 10 years. PhilHealth’s actuarial responsibilities and payables remain large. How can anyone argue that the use of PhilHealth funds for the government’s priority programs “will not affect PhilHealth’s daily operations” when the law is clear that such reserve funds, or any income of PhilHealth, cannot accrue to the National Government?

True, such a diversion of funds “will not reduce even a single centavo from the benefits that members will receive.” But PhilHealth can be compelled to increase the benefits of members. It is pointless to argue that by the end of 2024, PhilHealth stands to earn about ₱61.18 billion because the public health deficit is just too wide. Another ₱70 billion in government subsidies next year should be welcome.

It is therefore to the discredit of PhilHealth that the reserve funds accumulated to staggering amount, thanks to their treasury operations, instead of being used to mitigate the health conditions of Filipinos. Health care industry representatives were correct in saying that “the solution to PhilHealth’s inability to use its funds is not to strip Filipinos of health care funding but to implement immediate and substantial PhilHealth reforms such as increasing the scope and coverage of benefits packages.”

Invoking “due diligence” is almost meaningless in ascertaining that the diverted funds exclude contributions of paying members when these are co-mingled? While the diversion was coordinated and guided by the Government Corporate Counsel, Governance Commission for GOCCs and the Commission on Audit, the alternative use to “invest in the nation’s economic growth and development particularly in government infrastructure and social programs” actually pits these items against public health in promoting economic development. We doubt whether these public agencies ever addressed the existential issue that public health is a matter of life and death, while infrastructure and other social services can wait for another day. 

We share the spirit of the letter of former Philippine health secretaries “to be sensitive to public opinion and exercise prudence and caution by not transferring the next tranche of funds and succeeding transfers” because it strikes at the very heart of public health issue. PhilHealth funds are better used to benefit, for instance, indigent patients who have to spend hours queuing at PCSO for some additional help. On the other hand, no one can take issue with the letter of former Philippine finance secretaries in support of the fiscal responsibility to optimize excess funds of public agencies. 

But the optimal use of public funds is not the issue here. It is PhilHealth’s failure to use its funds to provide health coverage to millions of Filipinos, it is PhilHealth’s incompetence in broadening public health benefits. There could only be bad fiscal management if PhilHealth continues to expand its treasury operations even as its payables to individuals and hospitals are mounting? If there are just too many unmet health needs, how can anyone assume there are excess funds in the first place?

And even assuming there are legitimate excess funds, or savings, to speak of, is the Finance department’s circularlegal or constitutional? Can the diversion of funds be properly done? 

Multisectoral opposition 1Sambayan led by Retired Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio and lawyer Howard Calleja argued that only the President is authorized by law to transfer savings from one item to another in the appropriations for the Executive Branch under the appropriations law. To 1Sambayan convenors, the delegation of power to a cabinet secretary to transfer savings from GOCCs to the Bureau of the Treasury is unconstitutional. That power exclusively belongs to the President. 

Thus, “the two transfers of idle or unused funds to date from PhilHealth result in technical malversation of public funds and constitute the crime of plunder.” 

Equally important, 1Sambayan maintained that PhilHealth’s funds are special funds raised through taxation for a specific purpose which is to promote the universal health of Filipinos. 

1Sambayan’s points also echoed in former Senator Panfilo Lacson who stressed that both PhilHealth Law and the Universal Health Care Act are special laws that specify how excess funds from the state insurer are to be used. 

Advocates led by Senate Minority Floor Leader Aquilino Pimentel III had already questioned the constitutionality of the rider in the budget law and the Finance circular itself before the Supreme Court.

If the National Government opted to reform the PhilHealth yesterday and compelled its adherence with its mandate of providing universal health care, there would have been no “excess” funds to begin with. There is nothing with which to fund infrastructure and social services, nothing to convert to 0.88 ppts in real output and 600,000 in additional jobs. 

Why, this could easily be done if Congress were to halve its unprogrammed appropriations and reduce the funding for non-priority projects.",0
80,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Clear from the genealogy of PhilHealth is its continuing mandate to provide comprehensive and equitable health care. Policy-wise, there should be no more question that aside from quality education, effective public health is a good “strategy for bringing about faster economic development and improving quality of life.” It’s a direct, and no doubt, quick route to higher labor productivity and economic growth.

PhilHealth descended from martial law’s Medicare as administered by the Philippine Medical Care Commission pursuant to the Philippine Medical Care Act of 1969. Total coverage of medical services according to the needs of patients is its ultimate goal.  It was to be an evolving extension of medical care to all residents based obviously on the nation’s financial capability by mandating contribution to help build the medical care fund. 

The basic idea was first to leverage on both the SSS and GSIS medical programs while preparing to cover non-members on a compulsory and automatic basis. Not bad for a developing country in the late 1960s.

A National Health Insurance Program was established in 1995, mandating the creation of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and replacing the Commission as administrator. This law proceeds from the 1987 constitutional mandate for “an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all people at affordable cost.”

For the same reason, the Universal Healthcare (UHC) Law of 2019 automatically enrolled in PhilHealth all Filipino citizens, including overseas Filipino workers. This means any Filipino can avail himself of health care benefits even without a PhilHealth ID card. There is no better way to institutionalize universal health care than through a contributory health insurance scheme.

Yes, the operative words are accessibility and affordability. 

All citizens shall have access to health services at first “with at least a basic minimum package of health insurance benefits.” The law prioritizes a person’s health needs than his ability to pay based on the principle of risk sharing among various income and age groups. There is also unequivocal mandate for PhilHealth to contain cost to help the people afford healthcare services.

Since not every one of the 113-million Filipinos contributes to the fund, and medical cost is rising like crazy, health premium is not just enough even if it was recently jacked up. With a broad coverage of inpatient care, among others, budget support is essential. Funding is short even with contributions from PCSO and PAGCOR and from the budget itself of the Department of Health. 

For 2024, PhilHealth received more than a hundred-billion-peso budget to accommodate an expanded pool of beneficiaries and to sustain current programs. Some 1.31 million indigent and financially incapable patients are to receive medical assistance. With parallel efforts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other government programs, some 12.75 million indigent members are expected to be reached this year. 

This is far from universal even as the intent is. 

If past WHO data were to be a guide, PhilHealth has a lot of homework to do. With sustained population growth, life expectancy in the Philippines surprisingly declined from 69 years in 2000 to 66.4 years in 2021. In Western Pacific, comparable data actually rose from 72.4 years to 77.4 years. In this age, tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death for children below five. Why, this is a scourge of highly impoverished nations.

And if this is not enough, based on statistics from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the healthcare continues to be a big burden for households. Their out-of-pocket payment had the biggest share of 44.5 percent among the health care funding schemes in 2023, higher than government and voluntary healthcare system.

Comparing the Philippines with other ASEAN neighbors in terms of critical health outcome shows some embarrassing results. Three years ago, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies in a study prepared by research fellow Valerie Gilbert T. Ulip and research analyst Lyle Daryll D. Casas ('Regional Health Integration and Cooperation in the Philippines') concluded that we fell behind our ASEAN counterparts. Normally, health systems must have sufficient health facilities offering different types and levels of health services. 

This is not the case for the Philippines.

For instance, hospital beds are limited, short of 400,000 beds. Half of the Filipinos have no timely access to primary healthcare facilities. We spend only about 1.5 percent of GDP to health, really no comparison with Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Our handicap in health human resources is just enormous. Ten percent of our rural units have only one doctor each while many health facilities do not even have a nurse or a midwife. Finally, our public health capacity for emergencies is extremely low. WHO’s international health regulations gave us a score of only 53 percent, only better than Lao PDR and Cambodia.

No AI is necessary to draw the extent of the challenge for the health sector in the Philippines. There is so much ground to flesh out the universality, accessibility and affordability of healthcare system. 

Adding the regular contributions of members to subsidies from the national government and remittances from both PCSO and PAGCOR yields big, big shortfall. Yet, PhilHealth failed to spend all its money in 2024 to the tune of ₱89.9 billion. 

With dwindling fiscal space and burgeoning public debt that has exceeded the threshold of 60 percent of GDP against the commitment of NG to refrain from introducing new taxes or imposing higher taxes, the only recourse of government is to increase the dividend rate and sweep all “unused funds” from government-owned and controlled corporations.

Finance Secretary Ralph Recto was recently quoted by ABS-CBN News saying that the full remittance and appropriate use of PhilHealth’s ₱89.9 billion could add 0.88 ppts to national output and add 600,000 more jobs. Interesting quote, but first, can the remittance be properly done and second, how does one convert it to output and jobs?",0
81,Jose Ma Montelibano,"The excitement surrounding gold and bronze medals, as well as the near-misses, has reached its peak. The first half of August has brought us more golden moments than ghostly ones, which I consider a true blessing. Now that we are in the second half of the month, the character of August is beginning to shift back to its traditional atmosphere.

The weather has been relatively mild, with no typhoons so far in August, thanks to July, which preemptively took the brunt of Typhoon Carina early on. We have experienced a few thunderstorms, but that is just typical for this time of year. This month, I’ve monitored two earthquakes so far: one in Surigao del Sur and the other off Northern Bohol. However, perhaps the more concerning issue is Taal Volcano, which has been emitting volcanic smog (or vog). Kanlaon Volcano remains restless but has been calmer since its disturbances two months ago.

What is turning increasingly sour is the political landscape, particularly the escalating feud between the Marcos and Duterte families. This conflict has sparked speculation that extends beyond mere politics, hinting at misgovernance and crime. I’ve read about congressmen pushing for the Commission on Audit (COA) to audit or disclose its findings regarding the hundreds of millions in confidential funds under the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education. Furthermore, there is tension surrounding the Vice President’s complaint about the reduction of her security detail, which has been cut from over 400 personnel to just over 300.

The more sensational news revolves around revelations from a former Customs Intelligence officer, who claims that after apprehending a large quantity of imported shabu, he was arrested and imprisoned. There is also a video from a press conference in which former President Duterte angrily and publicly orders the arrest of the Customs officer. Today, allegations suggest that the Duterte family has been involved in the importation of shabu along with controversial Chinese nationals. Adding to the troubles of August, the Bureau of Immigration reported that former mayor Alice Guo, a suspected non-Filipino citizen who managed to run for and be elected, has left the country without passing through border controls. Even more troubling is the possibility that Alice Guo might have been entering and exiting the Philippines without the knowledge of immigration and border officials. Golden moments are quickly overshadowed by embarrassing incidents, all courtesy of the pervasive corruption eroding the foundations of our governance and noble culture.

As I write this, we are in that part of August 2024 when a super blue moon lights up the sky. A super blue moon occurs due to the combination of three astronomical events: a full moon, a supermoon, and a blue moon. According to NASA, this rare alignment happens when the different cycles of blue and supermoons coincide on the calendar.

What is technical or cosmic in nature is not only beautiful to behold but also sparks many other conversations, particularly in astrology. Special meanings are ascribed to unique astronomical coincidences, and I cannot fault those who believe there is something magical or spiritual about full moons in general, and super blue moons in particular. Nature has a way of reminding us, through its beauty or power, that there is much we still do not comprehend. We do know, however, that full moons are truly a sight to see and that the moon’s movement affects ocean tides.

In our ignorance of the full context and role of the moon in earthly life, we tend to dismiss its significance—unless one is connected to life around the ocean and seashores. Or, in that ignorance, we speculate about hidden meanings, both spiritual and occult, using our intuition or imagination.

Ignorance often drives people to act in ways that can be irrational or even foolish. When we lack understanding, we feel insecure, leading us to create configurations of life that ease that insecurity. Too often, we follow blindly, either a cult leader or a herd. One thing is certain: we cannot help but speculate, even gossip, simply to vent our fears. Many politicians or religious leaders have exploited this throughout history, profiting and gathering armies of followers by tapping into the fears of the uninformed.

In more recent times, however, there are fewer spellbinders and religious fanatics, mainly because money has overtaken many of them. Money has taken on god-like powers because society has decreed it so, placing it as the primary value in life. Money is now considered the master key to all problems, replacing the deity we once revered. Our traditional value system has become warped and is now centered around money as the ultimate goal. This distortion persists until death becomes imminent and undeniable, coupled with the growing realization that money cannot halt our mortality.

The ascendancy of money is proportional to the descendancy of our capability to stand on our two feet from the power of what we can do ourselves. The more we do not know how to fend for ourselves, the more we depend on money to do it for us. This weakness is what makes the world go round, as the old saying goes, as money is the tail that wags the dog. It is pitiful to witness the way money has risen to capture mankind over my lifetime, but it is a bitter reality that must be admitted.

In the true sense, there is no learning poverty among our young. Children by divine or natural design are like sponges – they learn whether they try to or not. If there is now a measured “learning poverty” among them, it is directly proportional to the poverty of teaching – meaning what is taught is poor, impoverished, severely lacking in quality and in spirit. This is, to my mind, the greatest challenge before us today, how to undo the artificiality of the life we live and discard the alternative reality dominating us.",0
82,Jose Ma Montelibano,"August, the ghost month. I always thought it must have been the Chinese influence on our local culture, but Google says that the ghost month is part of the traditional belief systems of several other Asian countries as well. According to these beliefs, the ghost month is when the doors of the spirit world are opened, and the restless spirits search for peace, prayers, or pleasure in the earthly realm.

What complements and deepens the belief in the ghost month is that August often brings heavy rains or typhoons, resulting in floods. The ghost month is typically wet, gloomy, and inhospitable. The climate enhances the eerie atmosphere of August, as if nature itself is warning us to be cautious and to stay indoors, given the challenging weather conditions.

However, there were signs that August 2024 would be different from the typical ghost month.

Typhoon Carina arrived early, bringing torrential and record-setting rains and floods, and setting a gloomy tone after a relatively well-delivered presidential speech during the SONA had eased the negativity in the air. But that was in July, not August. Instead, August began with a bang. From being ghostly, it turned golden, thanks to Caloy Yulo, who won two gold medals. Female boxers Nesty Petecio and Ain Villegas contributed two bronze medals, bringing the Philippines’ total to four Olympic medals—the most in our Olympic history.  I know there were disappointments too, but winning medals at the Olympics is no easy feat. EJ Obiena and Bianca Pagdanganan came close to adding two more bronze medals, but fate was not kind to them. Neither were the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) and the National Golf Association of the Philippines (NGAP), which failed to provide our national golfers, Bianca and Dottie Arbina, with their uniforms. They provided many excuses, but none justified the embarrassment our golfers faced while having to paste the Philippine flag on their personal T-shirts.

Anyway, what an August this has been so far—so opposite its reputation—and I am thankful. At the same time, August still remains the ghost month, with two more weeks to go. I suggest we stay careful and cautious, even if we do not wish to focus on the negatives. The world is turbulent; it is not just the spirits who seek peace. The Middle East is a hot global flashpoint, the Russia-Ukraine war continues, and the West Philippine Sea remains troublesome for Asia.

The situation on the home front is equally troubling. The rivalries between the Marcoses and Dutertes are escalating in intensity and becoming increasingly contentious. It’s an unusual conflict arising from two partners who recently achieved success in winning the presidency and vice-presidency. However, a third of the electorate believes that the Commission on Elections (Comelec) secured this victory through a seemingly miraculous Smartmatic system. Lacking technical expertise, I reserve my condemnation on this matter. Nevertheless, I previously highlighted the illegitimacy of the 2022 elections due to widespread vote-buying.

While the two-thirds, amounting to approximately 31 million voters, who claim to have supported Marcos and Duterte are becoming embroiled in a deepening conflict, I take solace in the fact that the minimum of 15 million voters for Leni are choosing to remain detached from the struggles of the deeply divided Uniteam. They should continue to distance themselves from this escalating dispute, which could potentially turn deadly. It is enough for these 15 million to uphold their integrity, thereby fostering honesty, transparency, and accountability in their own lives.

In times of chaos, we must ground ourselves and our families in fundamental survival principles within a spirit of bayanihan. Very few among us are wealthy enough to comfortably weather sudden upheavals. We must safeguard our food supply, strive to produce as much as possible, and work together to establish a more localized food network.

If we pay attention, we notice that government projects are now often worth tens or even hundreds of billions. There isn’t much we can do about that except hope that project costs are inflated by no more than 30% since the rumored kickback is around 40%.

While some individuals can engage actively in anti-corruption initiatives, most of us should focus our efforts closer to home. Embrace sustainable practices and grow your food wherever possible. Those in the majority who face financial hardships can mitigate the effects of inflation by cultivating as much of their own food as they can.

By taking charge of our own needs instead of relying on others, we can also teach younger generations to be resourceful. A resurgence of the Do-It-Yourself culture must begin with food production. Being self-sufficient empowers us, ultimately fostering confidence and resilience. Our children and grandchildren will not learn these essential skills unless we pass them on. They are already victims of what is termed “learning poverty,” which naturally indicates an equivalent poverty in teaching.

There is a long list of things that are already wrong that can get worse, but that is not our focus in this article. Rather, like our athletes who made it against the worse of odds, we must try to go for the gold, too. We have waited for our leaders to solve our problems and, as a result, we have dug our own holes deeper. There is no Tallano gold, no 20 peso/kg rice, and no Uniteam – only budol after budol.

I pray, sooner than later, that we understand how the brighter tomorrow is in our hands first before the leaders try it themselves. But if we fail, I believe that they, too, will fail.",0
83,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I was with friends when the news of Caloy Yulo winning his first gold medal was announced. Immediately, the euphoria began. We could not help it; it felt like rain after a long, painful drought. I do not think it was just a drought of Olympic medals, even if gold. We know that we are up against the elite athletes of the whole world in their own unique arena – the Olympics. We want the gold like everyone else, but we know it is not a matter of entitlement, not something we can expect as a matter of right. That is why, when we get it, like Caloy got it for us, we celebrate like crazy – one of our own is the best among the best.

Our euphoria, however, was much more than that. Yes, Caloy’s first gold triggered it, but there was a dam about to burst and it did. Beyond sports, many Filipinos have long been in a painful drought. It is hard to put in words because then, they would sound partisan, as though the drought is only a matter of politics. No, it is not. It is more than politics, it is more than economics; it is everything that we call a better Philippines, the search for what is good and right, for peace and harmony, and freedom from poverty and the cesspool of exploitation that blankets the country.

The one thing about living long enough and being observant for most of it is that I see aspects of reality not as random events but as parts of continuing threads. This capacity is not mine alone but for every Filipino who remembers, looks, thinks, and can connect the dots, as they say. Vicious cycles remain both vicious and cycles only because the pain from experiencing them is not learned or quickly forgotten. Those who use the political slogan “Never Again” must be aware of how inutile it is for people who forget and cannot connect the dots.

It takes a deliberate decision to pursue what should be a common dream for all citizens after that dream is frustrated again and again. Septuagenarians like me, no matter how much of an activist we may have been earlier in life, also tire, also despair, also want to give up. We have witnessed the vicious cycles more times than we care to count, and it makes us wonder if reason and intelligence are truly natural features of humans. I have wondered for a long time, and I only know that I cannot count on the consistency of these great faculties. One thing that I have always counted on is the idealism of the young. It is like a guaranteed gift, a divine safety mechanism against the weakness of man when tempted by greed or lust for power. And, by the way, I do not mean only public officials, whether elected or appointed. In a democracy, the majority of citizens have to enable the greedy and power-hungry. In our democracy, the majority of citizens have truly empowered them. There may be a variety of reasons, but ultimately, citizens have empowered the greedy and power-hungry.

Staying in a democracy that needs us badly to be the citizens that a democracy needs forces us to find our hopes and aspirations in the nobility of our young. From birth to teenage years, the fire of idealism is a natural force. However, it is not invincible. During this same period, idealism is exposed to the harsher realities of life. It may be material poverty and the squalor it festers in that inflates our animalistic nature rather than grows our humanity. More deadly, though, is the squalor of corrupt values and the behavior they engender.

Understanding this as one cycle I have observed in the decades I have lived, it now makes me doubt if all the activism for good governance and good citizenship is worth pursuing. The dramatic shift of societal values from our traditional ones to the dominant ascendancy of money and power cannot be restrained simply by a Constitution, no matter how idealistic it is. In fact, the more idealistic the Constitution is, the more impossible it becomes to adhere to.

There remains only the natural idealism of our young before they lose it to compromise and the need to survive in a materialistic world. Nurturing that idealism is becoming more urgent as the strongest prevention against perennial corruption and poverty. Strange as it may seem, the greedy and corrupt try to hide their dirty ways from their own young as long as they can. Advocacy to nourish the young’s idealism should have more open access to them with the least resistance from the evildoers of society.

This idealism is being unnaturally weakened by the very system we had hoped would strengthen it – mass education. That is why I am so focused on learning poverty, especially that part which measures our almost total failure in developing among our young students the capacity to grasp instructions. I am much less concerned with language, math, and even science as subjects. It is this incapacity to grasp instructions that stunts the development of the body, emotions, and mind. We risk losing the vaunted Filipino trait that has made us resilient against man and nature – diskarte or resourcefulness.

I acknowledge the remarkable achievements of Caloy Yulo and all other athletes who have elevated our national pride before the world. I congratulate them, and I am grateful to them. I have celebrated, enjoyed the moment of victory as though my own, too.

Now, I must remain focused on the 91% of public-school students who are victims of learning poverty. Even amidst the victories and celebrations brought to us by selected heroes of the moment, I cannot shake the thought of this 91% of the Filipino public-school students and the bleak future they face. It is to them and their liberation from ignorance or incapacity that we must dedicate more of our lives.",0
84,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I chose to write this article well before my weekly deadline. My mind is full of thoughts that I don’t want to let fade away once the current crisis is over. I recall September 25-26, 2009, when Typhoon Ondoy devastated Metro Manila and surrounding provinces, dumping a record amount of rain. Who could have imagined that Typhoon Carina would follow in Ondoy’s footsteps and even surpass it in rainfall?

Fifteen years ago, I was younger and more able to actively participate in Gawad Kalinga’s relief operations. What I witnessed was heart-wrenching. It wasn’t just the extent of the damage; it was who was affected and why. Typhoon Carina’s impact was no different—it was the poor who bore the brunt.

As always, there is widespread criticism of government inefficiency and possibly neglect. This pattern remains unchanged from 15 years ago. While there are now more details about the 5,500 flood control projects that were not there in 2009, the response remains similar. Government reactions, including Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s focus on trash and climate change as primary causes, are superficial. The root causes are deeper and more complex, which is why the flooding in Metro Manila will persist beyond his term.

Trash is merely a consequence, not a root cause. It exacerbates other issues. While the poor communities along riverbanks are often blamed for the trash, we must ask a crucial question: Why are they there? Riverbanks, canals, seashores, and crevices are not suitable for habitation, yet millions of Filipinos have settled there. They only end up being displaced when natural or man-made disasters strike, such as fires in the slums. But they will return, as they have in the past. Some slums in Metro Manila have been there for 50 years or more.

The reason they are there is straightforward: they have nowhere else to go to survive. The next question is: Where did they come from?

Many are survivors of previous calamities in their home provinces, mainly in the Visayas and Bicol, which are frequently hit by typhoons. When storms, earthquakes, landslides, and floods devastate their communities, hunger drives them to seek work in cities and towns. They leave because they have no other option.

Thus, when discussing calamities, climate change, and trash, we must address poverty. We need to understand the impact of calamities on the poor and how hunger and despair force them to relocate.

Poverty, like flooding, damages lives and property. To address poverty, we must examine who is affected, why, where, and how. Poverty is a consequence of deeper issues, leading us to the root cause: corruption.

Corruption is an insatiable force that consumes everything in its path if given the chance. Addressing Metro Manila’s flooding also means tackling corruption and poverty, not just adapting to climate change.

Looking at corruption and poverty in the Philippines requires a brief historical perspective. In the past, when our population was small and land abundant, the datu system needed people to make land productive. People had real value, while land was less significant.

Colonial rule, however, introduced a greedy master. Colonizers, driven by the desire for loot and bounty, distributed land grants to favored individuals as rewards or in exchange for tribute. Since it was all agricultural then, tribute from people mostly meant what people could produce. Despite the abundance of land, people were all the more necessary for cultivation and tribute. People retained more value over land.

Modernity shifted these dynamics. Advances in science and technology, particularly in reducing infant mortality, led to a population boom. More people served the few elites, who maintained their power and wealth. The elite, both historically and currently, have exploited others. This exploitation, deeply rooted in history, continues to shape our society. And why the term elite still carries a pejorative nuance about it.

Development has followed a master-slave dynamic, making calamities disproportionately destructive to the poor. The zoning laws and their enforcement are suspect, to say the least. They produce comfort for some, luxury for a few, and almost inhuman conditions for most. The real estate developers do not plan for the poor, but the government must. And it never did with a sense of respect and dignity.

Knowing what we have known for decades from our own weather patterns, government and private developers never established clear and equitable zoning principles. Naturally, when the ratio between land and people allows density, even traffic flow is choked – all for money.

Despite the Philippines’ democratic ideals, historical and traditional patterns of superiority and entitlement persist. Until democracy evolves beyond these historical inequalities, the divide will remain, with only superficial gestures toward equality. And we can forget solving floods in a metropolis that continues to defy safety and social risks.

Democracy is not a gift but a challenge. It must be earned, and it requires sacrifice, even the possibility of death. Democracy can be a powerful shield against calamities, poverty, and corruption if it prioritizes the common good over elitism. Intervention towards a sick metropolis can correct extreme anomalies and guide future development to be more friendly to the majority.

The power of democracy lies in the hands of the people, if they choose to seize it. I do not see it coming soon, however, because the people, especially the poor, continue to endure their fate.",0
85,Jose Ma Montelibano,"The Sona is over but the rains and floods are just starting. From a special report card day with a lot of clapping and cheering, it is back to the streets – and the streets are very wet.

I used to remember as a kid that we had longer rain months 70 years ago versus today. It’s either the La Niña phenomenon was occurring quite often then, or global warming has generally shortened the annual periods of rain. Because of that memory in the 50s and 60s, I am less worried about the frequent rains than I am with the longer hot months.

Pagasa today would describe our climate as 6 months wet and six months dry. This ratio is not at all when I remember, and not also how our climate was described decades before. Maybe Wikipedia has a better description that Pagasa, maybe because it can trace global climate records further back in time. Wikipedia claims we have three seasons instead of two, and I think I understand and accept why.

The three seasons are: a hot dry season from March to May, a rainy season from June to November, and a cool dry season from December to February. If I recall correctly, a powerful typhoon visited my hometown one early December in 1951 and devastated Bacolod City among other cities and towns in Central Visayas. The whole roof was blown away and we had to abandon that house. I do not need to recall the names of other typhoons that hit the Philippines on Decembers, Januarys and Februarys. That means the cool dry season described by Wikipedia is too often visited by not only rain but strong typhoons. Perhaps, because of my later advocacy against poverty, I had personally participated in relief and rehabilitation work when typhoons hit from December to February (mostly in the Visayas and Mindanao).

In historical warfare, terrain and weather are the most critical factors. They are matters of life and death that can cause victories or great defeats. But they remain critical factors in our daily lives as Filipinos as well. Between El Niño and La Niña and the pattern of typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions we experience, I am puzzled why our national and local governance do not give terrain and weather the importance they hold over our daily lives.

It is no surprise, then, that we go through the same consequences of disasters that are already part of our national cycle. If we do not put terrain and weather front and center in our daily and annual planning, we are going to get hurt – not the terrain and weather. And it is the poor among us, many more than the official numbers used by the government, that suffer the most.

Since this pattern has been happening since our independence from the USA, the cumulative damage to lives, property, and our way of life is shocking. More than that, it is almost criminal negligence by both national and local governments. Most actions have been reactive, ending up as band aid solutions to recurring threats. I have seen many sea walls put up over the last several decades, standing there as evidence of what appears to be more than just short-term interventions.

It is sad to say but I just have to, not as a way of putting blame on the elite, that the rulers of the country, including the government, never cared enough for the poor majority. The evidence is how we treat the victims of disaster, not just after a calamity, but thereafter as well.

Landlessness was a root problem because of this elitist consciousness in society, as though there was no recognition and appreciation of a divine plan that created a sacred relationship between man and land. For such a God-fearing people, or so claimed by many, a fundamental mandate of survival was belittled, as though the vast majority without wealth or influence can live like birds on a tree or fish in the water.

Man is a mammal, and from a scientific point of view, man is also a mammal that is part of the animal kingdom of the species Homo sapiens. In other words, man needs land and cannot exist without that land as part of his environment. He needs water and air, too, of course, but so far, it is his need for land to survive and develop as a human being that is most threatened, restricted, or denied.

The Filipino poor in my lifetime, or since operational independence in 1946, has been so undervalued that control and free use of land had been denied him. Most Filipinos were squatters, unable to get titles to land where their own ancestors had been born, lived, tilled, and died for centuries. A document overtook the value of human beings, disregarded their natural rights to their ancestral lands, because others a century or more later titled lands they never originally possessed.

As a result of modernization, when those with land titles began to find greater value as real estate rather than producers of agricultural products, millions of Filipinos were restricted or evicted from lands where they and their ancestors had lived. Displaced Filipinos had to go to seashores that stayed valueless, to upland slopes where the rich had no interest, and riverbanks and canals deemed unbuildable areas.

Then came the storms, the floods, the droughts, the earthquakes, and the volcanic eruptions. Those living along seashores and upland slopes were forced by hunger to move to urbanized areas in town centers and cities where they could beg or find menial work. Because of the terrain and the climate, plus the shortsightedness of greedy businessmen and corrupt government officials, Metro Manila and similar cities absorbed refugees from calamities and witnessed slums grow.

We pay for disregarding natural and social laws, for violating our higher cultural values and norms, succumbing to personal interests over the common good.

Yes, the Sona is over and Typhoon Carina just jolted us back to reality.",0
86,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I was finalizing my article for this week and was hoping to submit it well within my deadline. Before I could do so, however, I received a strange message from a co-worker of a favorite advocacy who was in France for both business and a wedding. For over 15 years, many French college students have found their way to volunteer in the Philippines. The relationship between university students from France and our NGO has expanded in many ways, including our work being made a course accredited by some French universities.


The message I received was unusual because it was not directly related to work. It was a short report on a visit to a French Catholic cathedral, the Basilica of St. Therese of Lisieux. It was his first time to visit the basilica, probably to attend mass, and it was a big surprise for him to see a huge mural-like painting on one side that depicted the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution. The painting was also framed in what obviously was a reference to the Philippine flag.


My friend said he was surprised, then humbled. In that famous Basilica dedicated to Sainte-Therese, Lisieux, there is nothing there that is primarily secular or political. After all, the Basilica is the second most visited religious site in France, next only to Lourdes. For Filipinos to be the subject of a major painting inside the Basilica was unique and awesome. Apparently, the EDSA People Power Revolution was considered less political than an actual religious miracle by the Carmelite Order in charge of the Basilica. Also, I am sure, by the authorities of the Catholic Church in French.


Surprised, then humbled. As a Filipino, he had every reason to feel that way. Why wouldn’t a Filipino be proud to be the first to oust a dictator and plunderer through a spontaneous, peaceful attempt to stop rebel soldiers from being massacred by a vastly superior military force? Civilians were a human shield to a small rebel group holed out in two military camps, civilians who for over a decade were resentful and fearful of the same military personnel they were now protecting.


It must have been the major role played by a cardinal of the Church who asked Filipinos to protect the rebels from the rest of the military. Additionally, it must have been the sight of nuns praying the rosary joining, even leading, the multitude of ordinary Filipinos who responded to the cardinal’s appeal. Considering everything – the moment of history when only violence could succeed against violent regimes, when hundreds of thousands who found their way to EDSA hardly knew others outside of their own family and friends, when flowers and rosaries became more powerful than tanks and machine guns – those four days in EDSA had to have divine intervention.


Today, a major painting is immortalizing that miraculous peaceful revolution in a major Basilica in Lisieux, France. Sainte-Therese is revered as the patron saint of florists, among others, and EDSA was defined by flowers as much as rosaries. That the Philippines has a deep history with the Carmelite Order is another relationship that binds the miracle of Filipinos at EDSA and the Basilica of Sainte-Therese, Lisieux. Of course, Filipinos can be proud – we were enormously so. Standing inside the great Basilica in Lisieux, Filipinos can be humbled at how they were admired and honored.


It felt like I was prodded to write something about the EDSA People Power Revolution because I had to receive that message just before I could submit the original article meant for this week’s column. I might be overthinking coincidences, or I might have needed an urgent relief from the incidents of shame that Filipinos have recently been feeling. In a matter of days, many Filipinos have had to live with shocking and shameful developments.


The first was the choice of a presidential adviser who had just been disbarred by the Supreme Court – for acts and actuation not fitting a noble profession. The second is the controversy of a tourism video that included scenes of beautiful places belonging to other countries. These two developments were humbling (in the embarrassing sense), depicting the opposite of what is beautiful and noble in our race and culture.


I needed to feel humbled in the admiration of others to counter how other people and nations would be regarding us from the recent controversies. I know that many other Filipinos need to feel reassured that all is not lost, that decency and honor and unique creativity remain as great natural virtues that we strive for. A simple message about a Basilica, a painting, a flag, a peaceful revolution, and a miracle has been perfect for wounded souls.


EDSA 1986 was 37 years ago. Many have forgotten. Many were not even born there. But Filipino pride is not a thing of the past. It is our birthright – if we claim it. And claiming it is simply to live in decency, honesty, and service to others or bayanihan.


In like manner, Filipino shame has had many occasions in the past. Our history has had many betrayals where greed or ego became more important than patriotism or the common good. Our history points to local leaders who chose to earn wealth and prestige from our foreign masters rather than protect their fellow Filipinos. And as we make history today, we continue to see turncoats and traitors exploit the innocent – and idolized for doing so.


We have seen the best and the worst in ourselves. Every day, we have opportunity after opportunity to be the best we can be, or the worst. That is our challenge as citizens with the duty to be responsible, accountable, and, if possible, to go beyond our interests to help those in great need among our people.


It is never easy to pursue virtue. It is a daily struggle. But is living in shame truly an option?

87,Jose Ma Montelibano,"There are always great causes to follow, or even just good, simple advocacies that benefit the prejudiced in their respective societies. If, truly, a person wants to contribute to making the world a better place, there will be limitless opportunities.
At the same time, our passion for our chosen advocacy can make us totally invest our energy, our emotions, even our resources, with great risks of not achieving our goals. When that is the case, there comes a time when both body and spirit tire. Physical and emotional exhaustion can weaken our resolve and make us question if all had been worth it.
The practice of reflection, or the mere stepping back from the fray, so to speak, is a most critical requirement. Without reflection, we maintain a relentless pace and further heighten our emotions – even if they are heavy and negative. Until we break, until we make fatal mistakes, or until circumstances force us to submission or utter failure; sometimes, headlong into tragedy.


Three years of the pandemic and now struggling to discover what our new normal will be like, into the second year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that sent shockwaves, oil and gas disruptions, and inflation rates that made many economies plunge can sap the collective human energy. We are inside a global pressure cooker. Weaker countries, including the Philippines, will be more impacted.
Weaker countries are those whose levels of dependency for external and artificial support are high, whose people are unable to be self-sufficient in their essential needs. The Philippines and Filipinos belong there. The present disruptive global atmosphere is not going away soon. It is not only climate that is volatile but tempers as well. Violence is either in our midst or imminently threatens us. There is urgent reason to be better prepared, to be more productive, to be less dependent even as we are forced to take care of the weakest among us.
I have engaged in political exercises for several decades. It had been less for the fun of it, or for the profit of it. There is so much rot and pollution in the material and emotional dimensions. Yet, we cannot disengage with so much need among our majority marginalized people, or the laylayan. Finding ways to dismantle their cursed inheritance still seems so important to me. Along the way, one loses friends, even relatives, when as political partisanship poisons everything. Like many others, I need quiet and reflection time, to gather my thoughts and my strength.


Inevitably, I do fall back on the wisdom of others. I seldom remember their names but clearly remember their messages. I appreciate all the wisdom shared through words creatively layered as veritable art forms. There are many of these nuggets that I stumble on, always with perfect timing for their perfect content. Let me share some and the names of the authors from whom I borrow them.


Author and philosopher Howard Thurman wrote, “Don’t ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”


This one is more famous, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote, “The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.”
Funny, the wise men never asked who the president is, or was. They never asked who won or lost the elections. What one common thread is with the statements above, and many, many more that you and I have admired, is that wise men and women see life beyond oneself, and beyond one lifetime.


Thurman says that we need to find what makes us come alive – because the world needs people who have come alive. He starts with us as individuals, because we as individuals necessarily impact others and may become their inspiration.
Emerson highlights our usefulness our honor, our compassion, because these individual virtues make a difference. And without saying so, having lived, having lived well, and having made a difference, happiness may simply be the natural reward.
Having stepped back and reflected with the aid of the wisdom of others, there is now impetus in me to rise above my disappointment and exhaustion to look for what makes me feel alive, to begin anew the rigorous path towards usefulness, honor, and compassion. I look to the needs of others but I need to again come alive. I still want to make a difference, to be useful, but, hopefully, always with honor and compassion.
There are liars and thieves out there who encourage, by their examples and the kind of fame and wealth they generate, to motivate others to lie and steal as well. I believe they will always be there and will multiply in number unless a strong counterforce of helpful, honest, and inspiring role models multiply even faster.
What is crucial for our individual and collective nature is that virtue more than vice dominates our character, that productivity takes over from dependency and mendicancy, and that bayanihan, the spirit of community and sharing, rises over greed. The many ways that we can take this path and create a new trajectory for our national life depends on our resolve to do what is right, and do what we can do well. If we have the commitment, life itself will show us the way day by day.
Every year from today up to the next three decades will see the median age of Filipinos grow younger and younger. Yes, they will be younger, and we must help them grow their productive capacities. Most of all, we must show them many consistent good examples of how they can grow their character.


I will keep repeating the three fundamental national virtues highlighted in the last elections; namely: responsibility (ambag), accountability (resibo), and heroism (abonado). May they one day define the Filipino people and nation.

88,Jose Ma Montelibano,"Many have been complaining about traversing through flooded streets these past weeks. The rains are not constant but frequent enough to confirm that the rainy season has started. If the present pattern holds, there will be more flooded streets – even from just sudden downpours. Looking at weather alerts from PAGASA, there is always a good chance of thunderstorms most days of the week. Somehow, the earlier weather alerts asking us to prepare for El Niño seem to be almost like fake news because of daily thunderstorms. I think it is time that PAGASA shifts from warning us about El Niño ahead of making us prepare for floods. Or, PAGASA may again educate the public about the meaning of El Niño. I remember that El Niño was always related to extended droughts just as El Niña was supposed to be too much rain. There has been no drought, not even during the summer and hottest months. In fact, there was no alert about dams reaching critical levels and no water rationing resorted to. Yet, even the President had joined PAGASA in warning us about El Niño.


I had to Google what El Niño means because I was getting confused. It seems PAGASA may not be wrong because El Niño seems to be more about the hot climate more than a dry or rainless spell. This is what I found from Merriam-Webster Dictionary:
El Niño “is an irregularly recurring flow of unusually warm surface waters from the Pacific Ocean toward and along the western coast of South America that prevents upwelling of nutrient-rich cold deep water and that disrupts typical regional and global weather patterns.”
You will note that there is no mention of drought or a rainless period, only unusually warm surface waters. In other words, we can be flooded every week and it is still an El Niño phenomenon. Because the general interpretation of El Niño may have been leaning towards no rain or drought, we prepared for it by conserving the use of water. But when El Niño is about the temperature of water, how are we to prepare ourselves?


To think that I kept monitoring the water levels of the dams that feed the Luzon grid instead of keeping track of the temperature. I was so pleased and relieved that water levels may have gone down somewhat during the summer months but nowhere near alarming levels. At least, I can now just wait what PAGASA will tell us about preparing for an El Niño which will well be already upon us now.


I can now move forward and pay attention to our food situation. If there is no emergency from El Niño, we can reassess our situation to prevent a food problem. I have talked to some farmers who choose to wait out another season instead of planting their traditional crops. The high costs of fertilizers and fuel in the face of low selling prices discourage them from risking another planting season with little odds of earning a profit. And if El Niño decreases water supply, they are afraid they will have no irrigation as well.


We can look at food as a security issue in a world with so much turmoil from man-made and climatic disasters. That means importation is not a first option but more as a last resort. To be food secure means we must produce enough food for ourselves. Other countries may protect their own domestic supply in adverse conditions; consequently, importation is not something we must depend on.
Among different foods, rice is the most important commodity in the security totem pole. No matter what, there must be rice whatever the circumstances may be. Our farmers do not produce enough. Most likely, they will not produce more, only less. There is no profit on rice and there is no capital to keep on taking risks for small rice farmers. Rice-planting is there only because they have little option to do anything else. Many, though, will just keep going deeper in debt.


Rice farmers and their families, together with fisherfolk in our coastal communities, make up the majority of the poor in the Philippines. While they plant rice and fish, what they harvest is less for profit and more to feed themselves – or to barter with. That leaves the rest of us food consumers totally dependent on the volume of subsistence producers – or importations. No food security at all.
I wonder if our national leaders have any vision of building a producer base or just continue to depress prices of food in order to keep consumers from severe discontent. I just listened to a speech of the President where he said we should discourage dole-outs and instead empower the poor. That is very good because the poor, when empowered, will become the production base of the Philippines.
Unfortunately, the President must sit down with his officials and count the total cost of the government’s dole-out program. He might be shocked to note that his dole-outs, the ones he says he does not like but is in charge of distributing them through government agencies and programs, are quite humongous. He might then see how a fraction of that can be diverted and dedicated instead to empowering production among small farmers and fisherfolk.
Because they are national leaders, I would presume that they constantly ask themselves how government can find a good balance between production and consumption. Just like whether people ought to pay correctly for items or get them from dole-outs. Building a strong nation demands strong producers. Otherwise, a weak nation will be swallowed in endless consumption and corruption.


Looking at the majority comprising classes D & E, they are more representative of the Filipino than those from the A & B. They are the El Filipino. It is them we must all endeavor to bInqeditorsuild towards their higher productive self – and steer away from their endless consumption-dependent state. Without them, there will be no strong nation.

89,Jose Ma Montelibano,"Ten-year-old Filipinos, 91% of them, cannot read and write well, cannot grasp instructions. They have barely stepped into Philippine society and they are already on the way to becoming a lost generation.

There are wonderful statistics of Philippines demographics that will place our population in the next several decades as among the youngest in the world. Indeed, if life were about humans as the prized assets of earthly existence, this trajectory towards youthfulness is wonderful. But life today and what it is building up to be in the near future is dangerous for a budding generation unless it is rich and unless it is smart.
Our new generation, the one that will be around for the next 60 years, is neither rich nor smart. I am talking about the general rule, not the exception. The general rule says that 91% of ten-year-olds are not proficient in reading and writing, and are not capable enough of understanding instructions. This is a disabling foundation for a wannabe smart generation. Add another general rule for 80% of Filipino families who are compromised by food poverty and/or afraid of being food-poor. Not smart is also not rich.

Poor and semi-illiterate are mean gullible and vulnerable to disinformation, a ready-made generation for continued exploitation by the greedy or power-hunger. In other words, a lost generation is well on its way.
And, by the way, it will not be the first lost generation. The only difference is in the quality of the leadership of the country. It is expected that the elite, meaning the most powerful, the most wealthy, and the most learned, have traditionally governed societies, not just ours. If the quality of the elite’s leadership is cultured and rule-oriented, the rest of society is heavily influenced to follow in the same way. The opposite is just as true if the leadership is dishonest and unjust.
The previous lost generations were conditioned by history and tradition. However, a series of reasonably honorable leadership had driven the transition from blind obedience to the birth of aspirations for an improving collective life. Thus, a steeply hierarchical structure of leadership slowly morphed towards the ideals of democracy calling for equitable representation.
The impact of that transition expressed itself in more resources for mass education, social services, and regular elections. Never enough but bigger than what it had always been. The series of leaders who believed in experimenting with a greater voice to the vast but poor majority actually managed to bring democracy closer to being felt and appreciated.

Until authoritarianism crept back to being the dominant influence under martial law. It was a painful backslide considering it awakened what was the deepest embedded memory of governance from the pre-Hispanic datu system. Fortunately, modernity had penetrated the wall of ignorance effectively enough for the people to seek freedom again. It helped that the dictatorship bankrupted the economy and the Philippine government. Hunger, abuse, and frustration produced a people-led rebellion. Freedom and democracy found a second chance.

There should be no more reason for a lost generation to emerge. Reality, however, is quite harsh. The combination of corruption and disinformation, or disinformation driven and funded by corruption, has established a strong foothold in blinding the intelligence of our young generation. It is not anymore blind obedience, it is a blighted intellect in an atmosphere of false and fake news with an agenda.
I should take heart, though, with a few examples from the emerging generation, two in particular. The first is Coby Santos Lim, a Filipino chosen to be the student speaker in a commencement exercise of a graduate school in the United States. An engineer who pursued higher studies in the University of California Berkeley stood before the faculty, parents, and guests in a recent graduation exercise to say that he will strive to be an ethical engineer and use his learnings to fight disinformation afflicting Philippine society. He decried especially the use of computer-driven election results after a massive disinformation campaign.

Just a few days later, another commencement speaker in Ateneo de Davao, Gwyneth Marie Vasquez, spoke of her achievements having been made possible, not only because of her intelligence and personal diligence, but by the support system made available to her by her parents and the privileged institutions she studied in. She mentioned a friend from a lumad community who expressed her deep wish to even just finish schooling, because higher-learning opportunities for lumad children were rare. Gwyneth asked us who are part of that privileged strata to re-examine how we can share our blessings.
I know that I speak of exceptions with Coby and Gwyneth. But something in their spirit was telling me that others, too, among the tens of millions who are neither rich nor smart must also be carrying the same seed. There may be a thick crust of manipulated darkness covering that seed but there must also be some millions of Cobys and Gwyneths feeling and seeing a dream they must pursue.
I have believed for so long in the idealism and purpose for every new generation. Now, I wonder at times if I am already fooling myself. I wonder, too, if my parents had also wavered in their faith that the new generation they had given birth to could remember that facts, truth, and honesty were the main features of their operating system. I hate to tell them that many of us had forgotten, that many of us had compromised, and the evidence is in the kind of society we built in our lifetime.

At this juncture, I have to hold more strongly to the faith of a greater force out there, of a greater purpose for all of us, and the constancy of divine parameters that human deviants cannot simply disregard without grave consequences. Because life must have a deeper meaning, not only for me, but for humanity as a whole. And because we must not have more lost generations even beyond our watch.",0
90,Jose Ma Montelibano,"If you are “caught between a rock and a hard place,” you are in a difficult situation where you have to choose between two equally unpleasant courses of action. That is where we find ourselves today in our labor-and-wages situation, difficult and cannot be resolved in and by itself.

There is constant pressure between labor and the compensation it receives, even under the best of circumstances. As economic conditions improve, businessmen and corporations earn more profits while their compensation packages become more generous. Still, the pressure between labor and capital, or labor and the state in certain countries, remains albeit less contentious.

Unfortunately, there are no best circumstances in the Philippines and hardly any in the foreseeable future. The running total of all efforts so far has managed to keep a steep imbalance between capital and labor. It is the natural order of things, both the momentum and trajectory in Philippines society – and not only in the economy.

The pervading value system is also quite traditional, setting the elite and powerful miles apart from the mass population. What more for the lowest in the totem pole who still comprise a substantial percentage of the total Filipino population? All official and unofficial standards follow this value system where money and power rule absolutely.
There was a time when the virtue of honor stood in between the elite and the ordinary. Honor was a mediating force, also a deterrent against abuse by the rich and powerful. Today, honor is a rare commodity. It remains widely regarded as essential in law, especially as a code of conduct for public officials and employees. But laws that are wantonly violated and disregarded are not laws, just texts in books.

What is valuable to people is what they experience as real and dominating. If law-breaking dominates instead of law-abiding in daily life, that is the value that will be followed. It is twisted and perverse, but it will be emulated as the primary model of society.

Democracy remains a dream that is now more of a myth than an aspiration. It is not the collective pursuit by the mainstream Filipino, who remains by and large much more concerned about the food on the table. The need to survive simply comes first.

At the same time, the need to survive conditions the minds and hearts of the poor to be grateful that they do survive with the assistance from government, politicians, and patrons in society. Grateful to be alive has replaced dreams and aspirations for tens of millions who are still trapped in food poverty, or threatened by it.

How does this attitude become the platform of productivity, the base of industrialization and prosperity? Never, of course. So never, too, will there be productivity and prosperity in the near future. Not until a determined, comprehensive, and sustained effort by government and business leaders will invest in it for at least the medium term. Because it means bravely and intelligently re-arranging our value system in favor of people over money and power.

Senate President Miguel Zubiri cannot be faulted for appealing for higher wages for labor. His cause has more than enough basis because daily wages have not kept up with inflation. Proof is that 80% of Filipinos are locked up in food-poverty and the fear of it. If animals could only complain, they may just have a lower fear of hunger than Filipinos.

At the same time, many if not most businessmen, small and medium, could deteriorate or even go bankrupt if wages were increased to the level that Senator Zubiri wants. And they have more than enough basis as well. Considering that they may be employing more Filipinos than large corporations only aggravates the threat of business reversals to those they employ.

This is the classic “caught in between a rock and hard place” example. Wages are important but cannot resolve one problem without maybe creating more. Maybe social scientists may be able to understand and propose alternative ways to economic and political leaders as part of a national effort, because the very value system of society needs a vital and urgent transformation.

Of course, the standard solution is there and will most probably be applied again. And, again as well, the problem simply gets more complicated and continues to fester a social resentment among the majority. We stay in that flux where major players in society remain at odds until a trigger fires the fuse of social unrest. This time, too, the government cannot just increase the salaries of the military and police that it relies on to keep order because the financial costs are not sustainable anymore.

All of the above will be the most likely scenarios when Filipinos have to rely on those who control power and wealth. There is nothing but that throughout Filipino history in the last 500 years. There is no trickle-down of anything valuable when the source of power and wealth increase in their desire for more power and wealth. For as long as there is no honor and applied as the greatest values in our society, the imbalance will simply worsen.

I believe politicians like Senator Zubiri smell the undercurrent of the masses. It has been muted by government subsidies here and there, but many subsidies will contract as the mendicant population increases and corruption will reduce government income.
If ordinary but concerned Filipinos cannot hope and wait for effective government action, and more-humane-than-profit response from the business sector, then its ranks must reach out to mitigate (or reform by example) the rock and a hard place configuration. We have to raise our own productivity, our own honesty, and our own generosity. It is good for our individual and collective soul, it is good for those we can help and capacitate towards their own independence from mendicancy.

Nation-building, after all, is not the work of government and businessmen, it is all our work, including them.",0
91,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I need to half-digress from mainstream politics and the elections—only half, because my greatest concern is the dire learning poverty of our public-school students, which is not entirely apolitical. When Filipino students at ages 10 and 15 perform disastrously compared to their global peers, we catch a glimpse of the quality of our young workforce today and in the next 30 years.

The numbers are damning. In the 2022 World Bank Learning Poverty Brief, 91% of our 10-year-olds were classified as learning-poor. Meanwhile, in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), our 15-year-olds ranked second to last among ASEAN nations. These stark realities expose the deep crisis in Philippine education. Instead of the usual rhetoric about education being the path out of poverty, it has only widened the chasm between the rich and the poor. The underperforming majority comes from low-income backgrounds, while the small minority of high achievers comes from the wealthy.

With education failing as a viable escape from poverty, we must brace ourselves for prolonged economic hardship. I see no alternative. For centuries, since Spanish colonization, both the Church and the State have relied on ayuda as their primary response to poverty—whether through almsgiving or scholarships for a select few poor children.

Over time, ayuda has evolved into a full-fledged government program, backed by well-funded initiatives. It is estimated that cash transfers and subsidies for the poor amount to around 600 billion pesos, including the controversial AKAP program. The government has combined anti-poverty projects with traditional almsgiving under politically branded programs—essentially signaling that it “cares.”

Yet poverty persists, particularly food poverty, which affects up to 70% of the population. This proves that formalized almsgiving, in the form of cash assistance and subsidies, remains grossly inadequate as an anti-poverty strategy. These programs may be charitable at best, but they lack the power to foster development and self-reliance. In fact, the common criticism is that subsidies have only deepened dependency. Worse, they have not just made people more reliant on aid, but more reliant on the politicians who control access to these ayuda programs.

As we quietly do our part—despite believing that the primary responsibility lies with the government—we must first understand the most marginalized in our society. They are everywhere, but they remain concentrated in rural areas, on small farms and in impoverished fishing villages. These are the communities that have long been neglected. Decades ago, both government and big business rushed toward development in commerce and industry, leaving these rural populations behind. Seventy years later, they are still struggling to catch up.

We will also find that learning poverty is most severe in these same neglected agricultural areas, which continue to serve as a pipeline for future urban squatters. This rural-to-urban poverty cycle has fueled much of the rapid urbanization we see today. Yet, despite this clear pattern, we have failed to learn from it. The rural poor remain overlooked, and in turn, the ranks of the urban poor continue to swell.

Exacerbating both learning poverty and economic poverty is corruption. It is impossible to reverse these crises in isolation because corruption serves as the underlying catalyst for both. No matter how we attempt to address education or economic development, we cannot escape the fact that corruption lies at their very core.

For concerned Filipinos like myself, it is easy to list an overwhelming number of urgent issues. But what we need most are solutions. That brings our focus to three critical areas: education, economic productivity, and corruption—the force that festers within both. We may hesitate to openly discuss corruption, especially when we recognize that the billionaire elite and corporate conglomerates, alongside the government, are complicit—whether by greed, cooperation, or silent acceptance.

Yet, despite all this, not all hope is lost. In fact, today may offer the most promising opportunities for change. Throughout history, great thinkers have viewed the worst of times as the beginning of the best. The most profound transformations occur when they are needed most—when suffering and frustration reach a breaking point.

When good men and women feel most powerless, they are often on the brink of discovering their greatest strength. Time and again, history reminds us that ordinary people accomplish extraordinary feats, especially when survival is at stake. We recall countless stories of individuals who have displayed superhuman strength in moments of crisis—when they, or those they love, face life-or-death situations.

Most of us don’t see ourselves as being in a life-or-death situation—certainly not in the literal sense. As individuals, we may feel angry, frustrated, or exhausted from hard but unrewarding work. Many struggle with uncertainty over their next meal or the fear of falling ill without the means for medicine or medical care. But few would say they are at the edge of survival.

On a collective level, however, I believe we are approaching that point. We are becoming powerless against the moral and ethical decay eating away at the nobility of our culture and the values our ancestors painstakingly passed down through their sacrifices. Life is not just about our pockets, nor even just about our stomachs. As human beings, we yearn for something deeper—the spirit that sets us apart from all other life forms. Perhaps it is more than uniqueness; perhaps it is something divine.

Our spirit, our soul, our dignity, our nobility—these are integral to who we are. Without them, we would feel empty, even lifeless. But how do we sustain them when our values and actions have become barren? At what point does this struggle become a matter of life and death? When do we summon the superhuman strength that history tells us we possess?

When that moment comes, may the best in us rise from the shadows. Tayo, hindi si Batman, ang bahala.",0
92,Jose Ma Montelibano,"It is exhausting to stay focused on what I believe should be our nation’s real concerns when the environment is consumed by political drama rather than the pressing challenges to governance and societal growth. But these distractions are not just a part of life in the Philippines—they dominate it. We have no choice but to factor them into our daily landscape and learn to navigate around them.

We are facing a crisis in food security. This is nothing new, of course, but rarely does the government even admit its existence as clearly as it does today. The crisis, however, persists largely because of an even more fundamental flaw—our inability to produce essential food items despite our country’s fertile agricultural environment. We have all the necessary ingredients: land, water, climate, farmers, technology, and consumers. Yet, our agricultural output remains disappointingly low. It is no surprise, then, that poverty is most prevalent in rural areas, among small farmers, fisherfolk, and their families.

Compounding the failure of agricultural development is the failure of education. Poverty in the Philippines is no longer just an economic issue; it has taken over our education system and given rise to a new term—learning poverty. Our public school system has reached a crisis point, with a staggering 91% of ten-year-old students unable to read or comprehend age-appropriate texts. This crisis threatens the very future of our youth, undermining what should be an advantage—our growing young workforce. Instead of being a strength, this demographic is being weakened by a crippling learning deficit.

With millions already struggling to put food on the table, and tens of millions more fearing food insecurity, we do not have the luxury of time to confront these crises as a united people. Yet, we continue to be consumed by distractions—politics and elections.

Even as we face the alarming prospect of an underprepared workforce in the coming generations, our attention remains fixated on the political zarzuela of two feuding, destructive dynasties. Somehow, we fail to recognize that these political families are not the solution to our problems but rather the very cause of them. We need only look at the last nine years to measure the immense societal losses we have suffered.

At the heart of these losses is the worsening corruption in government. The Philippines’ corruption index had already fallen below 100, only to climb back up to 115—meaning corruption worsened between 2018 and 2024, the years of Duterte and Marcos. The cost of corruption is evident in the staggering foreign debts incurred by both administrations—each adding approximately P1 trillion per year, compared to just P1 trillion over the entire six years of the PNoy administration.

This growing corruption is not just a crisis; it must become a national conversation. It is as urgent and dangerous as the continued neglect of agriculture, the struggle of small farmers and fisherfolk, and the learning poverty that threatens to cripple the productivity of future generations.

With another election coming in May 2025, we are once again at a crossroads. It is another chance to change the course of our history—or to dig ourselves even deeper into the hole we are already in. If we continue to elect the same kind of leaders who have enabled the neglect of agriculture, the decline of education, and the worsening of corruption, then we can expect nothing but more of the same. Except this time, our suffering will be even worse because we have already lost so much. If we are to believe the many surveys circulating today, however, Filipinos seem to be blindly diving into an even darker abyss.

At the same time, I sense a definitive shift—an energy sweeping across the world, rapid and unpredictable, carrying the theme of change. I know the Philippines will not be exempt, though I cannot say if this shift will affect the coming elections. But I feel it, and I believe we must prepare for the unexpected.

This is why I choose to focus on what we can do individually and directly—on efforts to ease food insecurity, reduce poverty, and reform our education system. Politically, there is little I can do beyond voting for candidates who have a proven track record in small agriculture, education, and accountability. I already know who they are because they have consistently addressed these three urgent national concerns.

I have made a conscious effort to be objective in sharing my thoughts, avoiding what might seem like endorsements of specific candidates rather than the advocacies they stand for. But in the 2022 elections, I openly expressed my support for Leni Robredo because she embodied the most critical virtues for Filipino governance—transparency, accountability, sacrifice, and bayanihan. I feel no less convinced today about Bam Aquino for education, Kiko Pangilinan for agriculture, and Heidi Mendoza for accountability in fighting corruption. I pray for them, I pray for the Filipino people, and I pray for our nation.

At this moment, the forces struggling for control are failing to maintain it. Instead, their battles are only adding heat and friction to an already volatile political and economic environment—one that feels like dry powder, waiting for a spark. In other words, no one is truly in control in this hyperactive and combative landscape. It is a delicate moment in our history, but it will not stay this way for long. Something has to give—and it will.",0
93,Jose Ma Montelibano,"As expected, 2025 started with a bang—the same bang that echoed through 2024. Unfortunately, this is not the sound of celebratory fireworks, despite 2025 already witnessing two New Year celebrations. Instead, it is a bang laden with a heavy dampness—except, of course, for the billionaire class.

The greatest blunder that buried 2024 in deep disappointment and resentment was the signing of the 2025 national budget, or the General Appropriations Act (GAA). Whatever goodwill the Marcos presidency had managed to generate could not neutralize the negative impact of a budget that continues to simmer with controversy. It is not just about the amounts allocated but about the arbitrary and reckless decisions—deflating critical budgets while inflating favored programs. The unexplained cuts and bloated political pork have only fueled public distrust instead of instilling the confidence Filipinos desperately need as the year unfolds.

In my article last week, I described our current state as being “at a low and fragile point.” I thought that was the gentlest way to put it, given that others have been more scathing. After all, the regular SWS surveys show self-rated poverty at its worst in two decades, now at 63%. Food poverty figures are equally alarming, and government agencies are finally talking about prioritizing food security. Inflation is reported at deceptively low levels, yet the majority of Filipinos struggle to afford three full meals a day due to shockingly high food prices.

As we enter the second month of 2025, I had hoped we could focus on how we—ordinary yet the majority of Filipinos—can help ourselves when the government cannot. But this can only happen if we are not constantly distracted by political feuds and reactionary squabbles. With the House of Representatives impeaching VP Sara Duterte, with the official campaign period now beginning, these distractions will only worsen. It is not a good time for Filipinos, and it is not a good time for the world either.

But I exclude the billionaire class from these economic and political woes. The wealth, power, and opportunities they possess shield them from the daily struggles of ordinary Filipinos. The Philippines, after all, recorded economic growth higher than most countries. But where did that growth come from? More importantly, where did it go? When economic growth coincides with deepening poverty and food insecurity, the answer is clear: that wealth has flowed upward, enriching the billionaire class and their business associates while leaving the masses behind.

It is a cliché—one that remains powerfully true—that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. But in the Philippine context, this is not just a cliché; it is a political indictment. It means the government has failed in its most essential role: to lead its people toward collective well-being. When continuous economic growth translates to greater poverty and food insecurity, the government is not leading—it is merely catering to the rich and powerful, clinging to a failed trickle-down economy.

Development must meaningfully and substantially include the 63% of Filipinos at the bottom. The principle of ayuda is not inherently wrong—after all, the Catholic Church and the elite have used it for centuries. But it is ineffective beyond addressing immediate hunger. A real development strategy must go beyond short-term relief and move toward self-sufficiency. Protecting the weak may start with feeding and sheltering them, but it must evolve into empowering them.

This means no ayuda without a structured development plan that fosters responsibility, hard work, and productivity. It requires all sectors—government, business, private institutions, and education—to create a sustainable framework for lifting Filipinos out of dependence. Our widespread dependency, the staggering 91% learning poverty, the inability of public-school teachers to deliver effective education, corruption in government, the neglect of small farmers and fisherfolk, and the decline of patriotism—these are all interconnected ailments. They must be addressed under one comprehensive vision and mission.

The accumulated rot is seeping through, as it was always bound to. We cannot continue making blunder after blunder, driven by greed rather than service and the common good, without paying the price. And we have been paying for it—wasting opportunity after opportunity to grow from our native resources, intelligence, and noble culture. We have reversed the natural order, turning ourselves into the world’s service provider at the cost of our own dignity. Again, of course, I exempt the billionaire class, who continue to thrive many times over while those who need to thrive the most fall further behind.

Recent COA reports expose the inefficiency of project implementation in agencies like NIA, DPWH, PAGASA, and NFA. COA is not yet alleging corruption, only mismanagement and waste. But we have heard the same about DepEd, PhilHealth, and Customs. It is only a matter of time before every other agency is publicly exposed—not just for inefficiency, which likely already exists, but for outright corruption. The rot will seep through, as surely as night follows day.

I want to speak directly to the mainstream Filipino—the poor, as well as those who consider themselves neither poor nor rich. We must reclaim our sense of shame and restore what we have lost: our dignity, our talents, and our fierce drive to take care of ourselves. We suffer the most, yet we surrender our freedom and agency to a government that prioritizes the elite. We search for solutions and saviors, but rarely do we look to ourselves.

I also want to address the billionaire class. There are countless justifications for accumulating wealth—even obscene amounts of it—while most Filipinos struggle for life’s essentials. But may I ask: please, grow a conscience.

And finally, to the government. You are the father, mother, big brother, protector, enabler, the last refuge of Filipinos in need—and most Filipinos are now in need. Patriotism demands the highest standards from you. Do not take the lowest road and become the treacherous bantay-salakay.",0
94,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I suspect I’ve been infected by one of the flu-like viruses currently surging in China, though our own Department of Health (DOH) insists there’s no cause for alarm. In other words, there’s no pandemic, no epidemic, and no new or old variant of COVID-19—just human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Our medical authorities seem intent on downplaying its severity, reminding us that we’re simply in flu season, an annual cycle.

It will take a long time before I can trust the DOH again. During the pandemic, corruption tainted every major expense—from overpriced COVID-19 tests and vaccines to the misuse of PhilHealth funds for emergency medical supplies that were never even utilized. And to think the pandemic was also used as justification to borrow trillions more in debt.

But I digress from my own insignificant health issue to one of the greatest plunders our country has ever seen—one I’ve grown tired of hoping will be resolved. Instead, I’ll focus on HMPV, which has been wreaking havoc on children and senior citizens, causing flu-like symptoms that linger for weeks, even months. Not deadly, if we are to believe the DOH, but apparently not serious enough to warrant a national awareness campaign on prevention and treatment.

In other words, we are on our own. Filipinos must seek remedies wherever they can, hoping they don’t stumble upon something effective yet unlicensed by the DOH and FDA—lest the source be legally harassed. I remember the first year of the pandemic when, despite offering no curative solutions, the DOH and FDA were quick to discredit alternatives like Ivermectin, which pharmaceutical giants disapproved of.

To help myself, I left the unhealthy environment of Metro Manila for a few days and retreated to the foothills of a majestic mountain. I hoped the fresh air would help, even though the high humidity wasn’t ideal. Still, the much cooler climate—ranging from 18 to 25°C—helped my body recover, while the quiet, only occasionally broken by distant crowing roosters, soothed my mind and spirit.

But like many Filipinos who know their health fares better outside the country’s urban centers, my options are limited. I am no billionaire. And as a senior citizen, my body is more exhausted, and my life savings, like those of many others, are not limitless. That means returning to a polluted metropolis, taking solace in the company of my grandchildren, and bracing myself for the hyperactive noise of traditional and social media—both of which seem to be a curse on any senior’s pursuit of serenity. Like a rocket that has wandered into deep space, I must now prepare for re-entry.

Life on Earth for a Senior Citizen

What is life like for a senior citizen like me? For someone deeply concerned with the socio-political landscape of the Philippines, full retirement is out of the question. The nagging thought remains: Have we done enough? The answer is usually no. Then comes the harder question: What can we do with the lessons we’ve learned—mostly the hard way—and how do we pass them on to younger socio-political advocates?

At the same time, life urges us to let go—to turn inward, not in a selfish way, but toward deeper self-reflection. Yet this is no easy task. We have spent so much time immersed in the noisy, external world that detaching from it feels unnatural. And it’s even harder to step away when the causes we have fought for remain vital to building a better society.

Should advocates simply abandon the struggles they’ve dedicated decades to? Would focusing on the spiritual—on possible life after death—be a distraction from making life better for those still here and those who will come after us? Or is it possible to balance inner contemplation with meaningful advocacy?

A Collective Responsibility

As much as I acknowledge that the state of our country is at a low and fragile point, I also know that the answer isn’t me—it’s us. A national dilemma requires collective effort, where each person contributes something better: better behavior, better productivity, better vision. Only then can we shift the national trajectory. The odds are against us because reversing a bad pattern is always the hardest and most painful task.

But this realization brings me peace. I cannot carry the burden of change alone because the problem is collective. Yet I also understand that even small, personal efforts—if successful—contribute strategically to the whole. The challenge is not to do it all, nor even to do too much, but to trust that every seemingly small contribution matters. This is the secret sauce of democracy.

I have taken a brief yet powerful respite in an environment that refreshes me—where the air is pure, the waters are clean, and solitude offers a healing magic. That alone is a great blessing. I wish the same for others, wherever they may find their own places of refuge.

A great journey beckons, and we must face it with courage and strength.",0
95,Jose Ma Montelibano,"While they are not new phenomena, the persistence of poverty and corruption remains deeply troubling, both as significant issues in their own right and due to the ineffectiveness of the measures taken to address them. These twin scourges effectively stifle any potential for widespread progress and prosperity, instead ensuring that such benefits are reserved for a select few. The enormity of poverty and corruption renders them national crises, yet it has become increasingly clear that national strategies are failing to make a dent.

In the Philippines, the seeming intractability of poverty and corruption can be largely attributed to the lack of effective law enforcement. Despite having a substantial police force, a broad judiciary, and a vast bureaucracy, their size does not translate into efficiency. They are present in large numbers, yet they fall short in carrying out their duties with competence. Consequently, the disparity and social injustice that poverty and corruption embody continue to fester, eroding the fabric of society.

But this, too, is nothing new. It is such a recurring state of affairs that many are discouraged from efforts to resolve them. The decline of the Philippines, traced all the way back to the 60s, saw it toppled from its elevated position among Asian countries until where it is today somewhere near the bottom of the barrel. All sorts of prognoses and analysis point out to one consistent factor among several, and that is corruption. It is not about the corruption of the many, it is about the corruption of the few who rule through formal authority, wealth, influence, or force.

My deepening interest in the study of societal life has been fueled by the narratives and research of historians, anthropologists, and behavioral scientists. I’ve also sought insight from the wisdom of the ancients, whose teachings have been revered by many cultures around the globe. In times of uncertainty and fear, merely skimming the surface of current events seldom provides clarity. Yet, by examining the cycles of history, we can discern echoes of the past in our present – patterns that seem to recur, pleading for a more profound understanding.

It is a natural human response for those who are frustrated to yearn for immediate solutions to the pressing issues that plague their daily lives. However, we often overlook the fact that quick fixes have consistently fallen short or even exacerbated the problems. Persisting with approaches that have repeatedly failed ensures a continuation of that failure, yet breaking free from this destructive loop proves challenging for many. It dangerously invites an innovative, even radical approach—sometimes from an external source—to interrupt the cycle.

Our domestic instability is further intensified by global volatility. As our political leaders engage in internal squabbles, the international landscape fares no better. It’s crucial to acknowledge our embarrassing reliance on the economic and political climates of other nations, as their troubles inevitably exacerbate our own vulnerabilities. Consider the significant revenue that overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) contribute to the nation and their families, or the business that foreign clients of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) firms bring to our economy, bolstering national income and providing jobs for Filipino workers.

The urgency for a national vision and movement to recalibrate our foundational principles cannot be overstated. We cannot afford to prioritize real estate development on our lands over enhancing them for increased food production. Our survival hinges on empowering our rural communities and harnessing the productivity of our lands and seas to sustain ourselves independently. We must honor the natural gifts bestowed upon us, rather than racing to become one of the world’s largest food importers.

As we revel in the blessings of our naturally abundant land, I hold firm in the belief that we are a people graced with intelligence, creativity, and an innate ability for human connection and service. It is with profound sadness and frustration that I observe the squandered potential of our bountiful resources and our talented populace, which have been met not with appreciation and cultivation, but with exploitation and neglect.

The plight of Filipino farmers and fisherfolk stands as a testament to this neglect, their invaluable contributions undervalued and overlooked in favor of imported sustenance. This same pattern of disregard extends to the nurturing of our children, whose natural intelligence and talent contrast starkly with a learning poverty rate of 91%. This dire statistic paints a grim narrative of neglect, abuse, and exploitation, casting a shadow over the future of our nation—a future inextricably linked to the well-being and development of our youth.

I am convinced that no vision or movement can truly resonate with and galvanize the Filipino people unless it acknowledges and builds upon the inherent strengths and capabilities of our land and our people. We cannot flourish by striving to become something we are not. My fervent hope is that a new wave of concerned and patriotic Filipino leaders will emerge—from our barangays, towns, and cities, from our farms and offices, from our schools and churches—leaders who understand that we must unite to confront our fears and aspirations.

The challenges we face as a people and a nation transcend the divisions of politics and governance. The landscape is cluttered with the cacophony of opposition, yet the voices of those who suffer the most, whether from material want or the moral desolation that pervades, are too faint. We need a national dialogue to address our collective burdens. To allow the turbulent winds of confusion and discontent to dictate our course of action would be an act of recklessness.

We can start on a modest scale, forming close-knit groups, until we collectively recognize the shared problems, the shared good, and the shared aspirations. Change is within our grasp, but there must be enough of us to initiate the journey toward it.",0
96,Jose Ma Montelibano,"There is no urgent need any more for me to alert people about the erratic and turbulent tendencies for life in 2025. I have been consistently pointing to it these last few years because the pattern had started earlier. In fact, the 2020 Covid 19 pandemic could not have been a louder warning about the disruption about to unfold.

Recent events in the last month that includes the sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, the political upsets in France and even Germany, the spread and relentlessness of Israel’s retaliation for their horrible October 27 experience, the shocking shooting of a civilian airline as it crossed Russian airspace, the fiery crash of another airline triggered by a bird strike in South Korea, the great earthquake in Tibet, and the raging fires that destroyed so much in Los Angeles and still not totally controlled, are glaring and graphic examples of a dark global pattern. I assume Filipinos are smart enough to intuit that these are not friendly times.

Yet, life goes on. It matters little if problems are solved or further deteriorate because life will go on. What should concern us is how to navigate an unfriendly environment and make things easier for ourselves instead of just going with a negative flow. The problems that plague the world, and the Philippines, are of a scale that is beyond our individual capacity to address – unless we focus on our own capacities and pick our battles. Because the great collective can be broken down into the little individualities – we just have to trust that many others will do their part.

Most of us will deal with survival problems, about 63% of Filipino families who have most recently rated themselves poor. Luckily, 26% regard themselves as not poor (though down from 28% previously). 11% look at themselves as borderline poor, which for me means they are most vulnerable to becoming poor. But if we add the 11% borderline poor to the 63% self-rated poor, that is a whopping 74%. How does a country formulate a progressive vision considering the deep contrast of 74% poor and 26% non-poor? Do we have a leadership that knows how to manage a society with great economic and educational gaps?

It is not prudent for us to wait for visionary leadership, let alone inspiring leadership. Our current situation is a result of years without such leadership. Fear has driven us, but true growth only comes from higher aspirations. We lack a collective cause to fight for, a national leadership to guide us.

Despite this, life goes on and we must continue moving forward. Merely riding the tide has led us to desolate shores. We cannot allow our future generations to suffer in a troubled country within an equally troubled world. We must gather as concerned Filipinos, prioritize our urgent survival needs, and find ways to increase productivity and decrease costs through collective efforts.

Food, shelter, utilities, and health are essential. Collaboration among farmers, fisherfolks, and local communities is crucial. Government support from the Department of Agriculture and Department of Trade would be beneficial, but cooperation with local government units (LGUs) is more immediate. Community agriculture and connecting with food enthusiasts, such as the slow food movement, are vital pathways to explore.

Addressing food and income economics is paramount, as is investing in education for both short- and long-term benefits. Learning poverty and the inadequacy of teaching must be confronted head-on. A national dialogue and debate on these issues is imperative. We cannot wait for leaders to take action; we must initiate change and invite them to join us.

While our leaders may have other pressing concerns, such as upcoming elections, family feuds, global dynamics, and climate change, we must prioritize addressing our nation’s fundamental challenges. Only through collective action and a sense of urgency can we hope to overcome poverty and build a brighter future for all Filipinos.

We stand at a pivotal juncture. Lacking are leaders endowed with vision, integrity, and the allure of charisma. Those at the helm are perceived as being driven predominantly by a thirst for power and the pursuit of personal wealth. The archetypes we once revered, steeped in tradition and culture, now seem absent. The prospect of reform or advancement seems bleak under the stewardship of those who have plunged us into this yearning for sincere and forward-thinking governance.

Therefore, we must look inward—toward ourselves—and to the fate that unfolds, hoping it might reveal the heralds of our time. While destiny will take its course, we cannot afford to sit idly by, waiting for deliverance, before we strive for our own survival and carve out whatever prosperity we can from life. This is a truth I will reiterate time and again: we are the foremost solution to our challenges, yet we must act collectively, with unity of purpose.

Currently, our solidarity can only be drawn from our shared convictions. We may not have a Pied Piper, a Joan of Arc, or a Jose Rizal to lead us, but we all yearn for their nobility, their integrity, their bravery. Our unity must be forged in the pursuit of what is right, in our shared welfare. There may simply be no other way.",0
97,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I almost didn’t want to write an article this week. The Christmas season, as marked by the traditional calendar, ended with the Epiphany—what we used to call the Feast of the Three Kings. Over the past few weeks, buoyed by memories of my personal history and the festive spirit of Christmas 2024 and New Year 2025, I managed to lift myself above the political chaos of the past year. But now, a sense of foreboding about what lies ahead weighs on me.

This apprehension isn’t about political partisanship—there’s no need for that. Most Filipinos who aren’t part of the elite circles of immense wealth and influence share the same anxiety. While the privileged few may not be completely immune to the challenges ahead, their resources provide a cushion to soften the blows of political and economic crises. For the rest of us, preparation—both material and psychological—is imperative.

We closed last year with what I can only describe as a bizarre national budget. Professor Cielo Magno, an expert in the field, didn’t mince words and called it “the most corrupt national budget ever.” Without her level of expertise, I simply find it laughable—but in a way that makes you want to cry. It’s a budget designed not for national interests, but for politicians in the Palace, Congress, the Senate, their sycophants, the DPWH and its contractors, and the DSWD, where vast sums of ayuda will flow. Let’s not forget the public officials who cling to their confidential and intelligence funds. This budget serves vested interests, not the people.

Meanwhile, questions about the use—or misuse—of PhilHealth funds refuse to fade away. Our education system fares no better. Learning poverty threatens the quality of labor and productivity for generations to come, yet DepEd faces budget cuts. We need an actionable framework to reverse this crisis, and it cannot hinge on teacher salary increases alone. Higher pay is essential but insufficient unless it translates to improved knowledge and skills among students in public schools.

And then there’s agriculture, a perennial horror story. For decades, small farmers and fisherfolk have struggled while importers and big businesses thrive. National leadership remains woefully incapable of charting a different course. The Masagana 99 program of the 1970s had potential, but corruption derailed it, nearly bankrupting the rural banking system. Half a century later, nothing has changed except ballooning budgets, rising corruption indices, and unchecked confidential funds.

As midterm elections approach, the lingering questions surrounding the 2022 presidential elections cast a long shadow. The Comelec and the National Government insist all is well, yet simple requests—like opening ballot boxes to match physical and electronic results—are denied. Why? What harm is there in basic transparency? This refusal reeks of arrogance and a deliberate lack of accountability.

Speaking of accountability, the same standards being demanded of VP Sara Duterte regarding the use of confidential funds should apply to everyone: the President, the former President, and all other officials entrusted with public money. Billions in confidential and intelligence funds must be audited to ensure they serve national interests, not personal enrichment.

Professor Cielo Magno has shed light on how a national budget can be twisted until it reeks of corruption. Similarly, former COA Commissioner Heidi Mendoza could educate us on the primacy of accountability in public service. These two respected UP professors exemplify expertise and integrity—qualities we desperately need in our leaders. Their insights could validate the substantial public investment in the University of the Philippines.

But even as we look to individuals like them, we must remember that the ultimate responsibility lies with us. We must learn from their example and strive to embody the same values. Leaders reflect the people they serve. If we tolerate dishonesty, our leaders will be dishonest. If we are too afraid to uphold our principles, that fear will be weaponized against us.

Last week, I wrote that heroism is the only thing standing between us and ruin—not the grand, life-risking heroism we associate with revolutions, but the quiet, everyday kind. It’s the heroism of being more productive today than yesterday because the stakes are higher now. It’s the heroism that makes us love our lands, mountains, seas, keep them healthy so they can feed and protect us.

It’s the heroism of caring for the elderly and the vulnerable in our communities, of rekindling the bayanihan spirit. It’s the heroism of caring for the young and the poor, taking them out not only from hunger but helplessness, the heroism of developing their capacity to be strong and ultimately independent.

It’s the heroism of simple honesty in thought, word, and deed—the kind our ancestors wove into the fabric of our culture. It’s the heroism that will not accept compromises to integrity, and the heroism to reward good deeds and elevate the common good.

Let us embrace that heroism. It is ours to claim.",0
98,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I blinked, and it’s New Year! Somehow, 2025 has arrived without a bang, much like 2024 quietly ended. Yet, a new year signifies another beginning, regardless of how the previous one concluded or how unchanged things may appear. This time, however, we cannot let the mere turn of the calendar dictate how we approach 2025. We must will the change—good values, good people, and good progress. It will not come unbidden; it must be earned and demanded.

The 2025 budget, sadly, reflects rapacious priorities rather than a genuine commitment to education and health. I had thought education was universally acknowledged as the primary path out of poverty and that health was both an urgent necessity and a political imperative. Apparently, I overestimated the power of logic and compassion to temper political greed and ambition. Even in my seventies, despite witnessing plunderers and murderers at the pinnacle of power, I still fail to learn that hope alone does not suffice.

This is why I must summon greater willpower to actively shape the outcomes I seek, rather than passively wait for life to gift them to me. Striking the delicate balance between individual initiative and collective responsibility remains a challenge. Life is, after all, a ceaseless interplay of the personal and the universal—a dance between self-interest and the common good.

Yet, history reminds us that prioritizing personal gain over collective welfare breeds division, misunderstanding, and resentment. When we elevate what separates us above what unites us, we create a world of many losers and few winners. This, unfortunately, has been humanity’s default setting: the triumph of force over the supremacy of principle.

The ideals of democracy, as introduced by our American teachers over a century ago, offered a vision of equality, liberty, and the common good. The lessons were so compelling that we began to dream of what was not yet within our grasp. However, democracy demands something we often neglect: the hard work and discipline required to produce the fruits of collective labor. The more each citizen contributes to society’s well-being, the more there is for democracy to distribute.

Yet, Philippine democracy—designed to be inclusive and welcoming—has fallen victim to its own openness. The framers of our Constitution assumed that democracy thrives when it allows almost anyone to seek public office. This noble ideal has, instead, opened the door to incompetence and opportunism. Over the decades, this flawed assumption has inflicted incalculable harm on a fledgling democracy struggling to mature.

The quality of leadership in the Philippines has steadily declined throughout our 80-year experiment with self-governance. What began with promise under American tutelage deteriorated swiftly after independence in 1946. From a conjugal dictatorship to leaders who plundered the nation’s wealth, our history is littered with missed lessons and unlearned warnings. Instead of reform, greed and ambition found new ways to corrupt the system, emboldened by the lack of accountability and a citizenry too often resigned to its fate.

And so here we are, at the dawn of 2025, burdened by the persistent weight of history. It is enough to break the spirit but surrender only deepens our misery. Despite the odds, those who believe in a democracy rooted in the common good, national interest, and love of country have no choice but to forge hope from despair.

How this can be achieved remains a contentious question. What is certain, however, is that it will require pain, sacrifice, and relentless resolve. Without lofty aspirations, unshakable courage, and firmly grounded principles, we will falter. Blood, sweat, and tears—these are the unavoidable costs of the mission ahead.

Regrettably, many will choose not to join this struggle. For some, it will seem easier to surrender the noble for the mundane, to trade principle for survival, or to participate in the very exploitation they despise. I cannot wholly blame them, even knowing they enable the corrupt and criminal. Perhaps divine justice will teach them the lessons that human logic cannot. In the end, we must trust in the Creator and the natural order when reason fails to quell our doubts and fears.

What is required of Filipino patriots today is heroism. Yet heroism comes in many forms, and not all are grand or dramatic. We need not be martyred like Jose Rizal, betrayed like Andres Bonifacio, or lead uprisings like Gabriela Silang. Beneath their celebrated acts of bravery were quiet virtues that defined their lives—virtues they refused to compromise. They loved freedom, cherished their country, and upheld their noble principles even at the cost of their lives.

At the very least, it is this quiet heroism that must fuel our hearts. It can manifest in small yet profound ways: being honest in our dealings, and more importantly, remaining honest when dishonesty seems the easier path. It can mean working diligently—on the farm, in the factory, or at the office—doing our fair share without resorting to lies or shortcuts. And during the political season, it can mean recognizing, supporting, and uplifting fellow Filipinos who aspire to serve with integrity, even when they offer no favors, promises, or material gifts.

If we dream of a proud and prosperous Philippines, then pride and prosperity must start with us. If we long for a noble and productive nation, our contributions must embody nobility and productivity. And if we envision a brave and resilient country, then our courage must light the way.

A new year brings the chance for new beginnings, and we have the opportunity to fill it with our purest resolutions. We may falter, stumble, or lose our way at times, but what matters is that we rise again—to be honest again, to work hard again, and to persevere. 2025 may not promise happiness, but it can be a year of purpose—a year that plants the seeds of a brighter, more hopeful future.",0
99,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I write this first draft after over 24 hours of celebrating Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Once again, Christmas has lifted my spirits from what has been a challenging and often disheartening year. I hope this is true for many Filipinos who have endured economic struggles.

2024 has not been kind. But whether kind or not, the year has marched on, impervious to human efforts to slow it down. Through good news and bad, time pressed forward, and now, we are turning its final page. Despite the hardships, I witnessed how the Christmas spirit, tentative in September, finally broke through to dominate December. Thank you, Christmas, for reminding us that hope endures.

This is not the moment to dwell on what went wrong. We know the struggles; we have lived them. Instead, we deserve this reprieve—a time to come together not to argue or debate but to savor the best of family and friendship. In these moments, darkness recedes, and light breaks through: the smiles, the laughter, the hugs, and the rare sense of peace amidst the festivities.

Rest is a reward in itself. Week after week, as I write and share my thoughts on public issues, I am emotionally engaged with the events and people I write about. While objectivity demands clarity and facts, true insight requires understanding human sentiments and behavior. I strive for accuracy and balance, but my values ultimately shape how I present my opinions.

Christmas, for me, is a strategic pause. It shifts my perspective on current events and the collective trajectory of life. The negativities of the year—visible, grating, and deeply troubling—were undeniable. Yet Christmas came, bringing joy and hope, reminding us that light persists even in dark times.

At its core, Christmas is about Jesus Christ. Without Him, there would be no Christmas. Whether we are Christians or not, this historical truth matters. In the Philippines, Christmas holds special significance, transcending religion to unite us in shared celebration and hope.

But soon, the celebrations will fade. In just a few weeks, the euphoria will give way to a longing for the season to linger, only to be interrupted by the daily grind of work, school, and politics. Little by little, the shadows of negativity will encroach, competing with and eventually overpowering the inspiration of Christmas.

It will be a year until Christmas 2025, but the gift of this season lingers in its affirmation of innocence. The Holy Child embodies the innocence inherent in all of us—an innocence we may have discarded or polluted but that remains part of our nature. Recognizing and reclaiming this innocence is essential. It is not easily activated, but it is there, waiting to shield us from the corruption that undermines our integrity and cultural values.

This is why we must turn our focus to the youth. While we lament the loss of role models among our leaders, we must acknowledge the slim odds of reform within the entrenched systems they dominate. The idealism of the young, rooted in their unsullied innocence, is a formidable force for change.

For compromised adults, reclaiming integrity is no easy task. Guilt alone seldom leads to genuine repentance and atonement. The older generations need the youth to ignite the movement toward a return to honesty and integrity—not just in governance but in the home and community as well. The shining idealism of the youth can inspire a nation and lay the foundation for a reformist environment.

I am deeply disillusioned with the failures of formal leadership across nearly every field of human endeavor. Bright spots exist, but they are rare among those in elevated positions of power. The way forward lies in multiplying these bright spots, empowering the enlightened middle class, and sparking generational revolutions.

We cannot afford to let Christmas fade into obscurity. Its power, innocence, and promise must not be wasted. Above all, we must not forget its lessons. Darkness looms, with political drama and looming elections threatening to distract us from our responsibilities as citizens of a democratic nation.

Soon, we will hear endless promises from candidates—promises destined to be broken like so many before them. We will be bombarded with proposals claiming to save us, when, in truth, we must save ourselves from them. Rarely, if ever, will we hear of leaders who aim to empower citizens to contribute meaningfully to our collective progress.

As we face the challenges ahead, let us hold on to the hope and innocence of this Christmas season. These are the shields we need to navigate the difficult path forward and reclaim the integrity and light that define us as a people.

Strong shields are necessary for the immediate journey beyond Christmas. While we are concerned about the Philippines, a greater world is out there driven by anger and fear, many already writhing in pain. All of them in varying degrees impact upon our collective lives in the Philippines. Our trials and challenges are national, regional, global.

Let us remember to find the answers in ourselves, our capacity to produce, to stand on our own two feet in courage, not fear, and take care of one another as much as we can. Much is asked of us, and we must not fail.",0
100,Jose Ma Montelibano,"PhilHealth is not about its organization, infrastructure, institutional expertise, or even its funds. It embodies a dream—a material lifeline for survival. This dream may not be shared by all Filipinos, but it represents the hopes of many in the middle class, the ordinary, and the poor. PhilHealth represents a critical dream for the survival of many Filipinos, yet it is under threat by those in power who have never needed it.

Unfortunately, in the Philippines, there exists a privileged minority who can afford healthcare without needing PhilHealth. For them, what is PhilHealth when they can fly to Singapore, Europe, or the United States to receive top-tier medical treatment? This disparity is unfortunate because, unless they show genuine concern for the Filipinos who cannot access such privileges, they only exacerbate the struggles of the majority.

It is even more troubling that the key decision-makers in the House of Representatives, the Senate, and Malacañang Palace are part of this privileged minority. They do not depend on PhilHealth funds or resources to access the best medical care. This creates an anomaly: decisions about PhilHealth’s fate are made by those who have no stake in it. This is not representative democracy—it is autocracy or oligarchy.

For decades, since gaining independence from direct foreign rule in 1946, the perennial challenge of Philippine governance has been how to serve the interests of the majority. These majority interests are synonymous with national interests. In contrast, the interests of the wealthy minority fall into the category of special or vested interests.

Special or vested interests, in themselves, are not inherently wrong; they are normal for those who hold them. However, when these interests override or subvert national interests, they become criminal or even treasonous. Today, we face a dangerous reality: those with special or vested interests now hold the power to decide over matters of national importance, such as PhilHealth.

In our pursuit of national interests, our fledgling democracy has always had to be vigilant, exerting both awareness and political will to protect these interests from being undermined by the privileged few. National interests should always take precedence, as they represent the vast majority. Yet, the concentration of power and authority in the hands of a minority with special interests disrupts the ideal balance needed for a just and functional society.

The struggle for truly representative governance has always been measured by the levels of corruption and poverty in the country. Over the past 70 years, successive administrations have attempted—whether through lip service or sincere effort—to address these twin challenges. Each Filipino must critically assess how well each administration has performed in reducing corruption and poverty and vote for leaders accordingly.

Looking back at our nation’s journey since independence, the overall performance has been disappointing. Why? Fundamentally, the measure of independence lies in how free and empowered each Filipino feels today. Judging by the growing reliance on ayuda (government aid) and the stagnation of human development, it is clear that our progress has been dismal. The cumulative performance of our leaders in the so-called independence game has been nothing short of shameful.

I wonder if our political and business leaders are aware that we are deep in the Christmas season, with Christmas Day just around the corner. These weeks are supposed to be the happiest and most hopeful time of the year. If there is already noticeable dissent and resentment in the air, it suggests that the underlying situation is far worse than it appears. By the second half of January, when the positivity of Christmas fades, we may face an even more troubling reality.

The Filipino people are no longer overly ambitious. They still dream, but many know their dreams are unlikely to come true—or will only come true if they leave the Philippines. However, there are minimum aspirations that Filipinos cling to, no matter how difficult life becomes: food and health security. To frustrate these basic needs is to play with fire.

Food and health are not just aspirations; they are survival factors—primal and urgent. There is one more hope that keeps many Filipinos going: the belief that education can free their children from the hardships they have endured. This hope, though fragile, is anchored in the aspiration that the next generation might have a better life.

The national budget must prioritize these three essential concerns: food, health, and education. When Filipinos see their leaders focusing on these fundamental needs, they are often more patient and forgiving. But to exploit or pollute these priorities is to risk triggering indignation and unrest, like a spark igniting a dormant social and political volcano. I pray that the country’s leaders remain sensitive to these issues and avoid serious missteps in these areas.

There have been moments in our history when quiet disappointment and resentment boiled over, reaching a point of no return. It seems we have not learned those lessons well, as anxiety is once again building. This unease is being stoked by the political fracas between the Marcos and Duterte factions. The powder keg is dry, so to speak. The cost of living has become unbearable for many, and trust in honest governance is eroding rapidly.

It is clear to me that we, the people, are our only saviors. Let this Christmas bring families closer together and realize that the times ahead are difficult. We must confront the storm together, help one another, increase what we can do for the good of our families and community to strengthen our food and health security. Let Christmas awaken in us not only the joy of the season, but especially kindness and the sense of community.",0
101,Phind Instant,"Income inequality has reached alarming levels in the Philippines, threatening the country's progress towards becoming a middle-class society free of poverty. According to recent reports, the Philippines has one of the highest rates of income inequality in East Asia, with the top 1% capturing 17% of national income while the bottom 50% shares only 14%.

This stark divide between the rich and the poor is not just a matter of statistics - it has real-world consequences for millions of Filipinos struggling to make ends meet. Despite economic growth and poverty reduction efforts, inequality persists and even widened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic exposed existing vulnerabilities and exacerbated inequalities in healthcare access, education, and economic opportunities.

To address this pressing issue, policymakers should prioritize several key areas:

1. Improving access to quality education, especially for disadvantaged groups like girls and those from low-income backgrounds. Education is critical for breaking cycles of poverty and inequality.

2. Strengthening social protection programs and unemployment insurance for informal sector workers. This would provide a safety net during economic downturns and allow workers to weather financial shocks.

3. Promoting entrepreneurship and job creation in underserved regions. Targeted investments in rural areas could help narrow interregional disparities.

4. Implementing progressive taxation and wealth redistribution policies to reduce the concentration of wealth among the elite.

5. Enhancing labor rights and collective bargaining power for workers to negotiate fair wages and benefits.

6. Increasing public spending on essential public goods and services like healthcare, infrastructure, and social services that benefit the broader population.

7. Addressing the root causes of inequality like inequitable land distribution and promoting agrarian reform.

8. Focusing on gender equality to break down barriers preventing women from participating fully in the workforce and economy.

Reducing inequality is not just a moral imperative - it's also crucial for sustainable economic growth and competitiveness. When everyone has a chance to thrive, the entire economy benefits. As the World Bank notes, ""no country has managed to make the transition to a middle-class society while maintaining high levels of inequality.""

The path forward requires a comprehensive approach combining economic policies, social programs, and institutional reforms. It demands political will, sustained commitment, and collaboration between government, civil society, and the private sector. 

By tackling income inequality head-on, the Philippines can create a more equitable society where every citizen has the opportunity to reach their full potential. The challenge is clear - now it's time for action to build a brighter future for all Filipinos.",1
102,Phind Instant,"Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) play a vital role in supporting the Philippine economy, with their remittances serving as a lifeline for countless families and driving economic growth. These modern-day heroes face numerous challenges abroad, yet continue to send billions of dollars back home each year.

According to recent data, OFWs sent a record $36.14 billion in remittances home in 2022 alone - a figure that represents about 10% of the country's GDP. This influx of foreign currency has become crucial for supporting consumer spending, which accounts for at least 75% of the Philippine economy.

However, behind these impressive statistics lies a complex reality. Many OFWs face difficult working conditions, long periods away from family, and risks of abuse and exploitation. Female workers, who make up approximately 60% of OFWs, are disproportionately affected by gender-based discrimination and violence.

The government has taken steps to protect OFWs, including issuing deployment bans for certain countries like Kuwait after high-profile cases of abuse. However, critics argue that these measures do not address the root causes of exploitation and do not provide long-term solutions.

To truly support OFWs and reduce our reliance on labor export, policymakers should focus on:

1. Creating more domestic job opportunities through industrialization and infrastructure development

2. Strengthening social protection programs for workers who choose to stay in the Philippines 

3. Improving education and skills training to increase employability at home

4. Promoting fair labor standards and addressing corruption in recruitment agencies

5. Enhancing diplomatic efforts with host countries to improve working conditions

While OFW remittances have been a crucial economic lifeline during difficult times, we cannot continue to rely solely on exporting our workforce. It's time to build a more equitable economy that provides opportunities for all Filipinos to thrive at home as well as abroad.

The sacrifices made by OFWs deserve recognition and appreciation. As we move forward, let us work towards creating a future where every Filipino can live and work with dignity - both here and overseas.",1
103,Phind Instant,"Food security remains a pressing concern for the Philippines, with millions of Filipinos struggling to access adequate, nutritious food. Recent data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization indicates that 5.3 million Filipinos were severely food insecure between 2019-2021, while another 48 million experienced moderate or severe food insecurity. This highlights the urgent need for comprehensive action to address this critical issue.

Several factors contribute to the Philippines' vulnerability to food insecurity:

1. Reliance on imported food: With the largest food trade deficit in Southeast Asia (around -2% of GDP), the Philippines heavily depends on imports to feed its population. This makes it vulnerable to global supply shocks and price fluctuations [5].

2. Limited domestic production: Despite efforts to boost agricultural productivity, the country still struggles with low yields and inefficient farming practices in many areas. Infrastructure gaps between farmers and markets further hinder domestic food production [5].

3. Climate change impacts: Rising temperatures and more frequent natural disasters threaten crop yields and fisheries, potentially exacerbating food shortages in the future.

4. Income inequality: The concentration of land ownership among a few large landholders limits opportunities for small farmers and rural communities to participate in agriculture and improve their livelihoods [3].

To address these challenges and improve food security, policymakers should consider several key strategies:

1. Invest in agricultural infrastructure: Improving roads, storage facilities, and irrigation systems would help connect farmers to markets more efficiently.

2. Support small-scale farmers: Programs aimed at empowering small farmers, such as providing access to credit, training, and market linkages, could significantly boost domestic food production.

3. Promote sustainable agriculture: Encouraging practices like organic farming and agroforestry not only improves soil health but also enhances biodiversity and resilience to climate change.

4. Enhance social protection programs: Expanding cash transfer programs and other forms of support for vulnerable households could help them better cope with food price shocks.

5. Improve nutrition education: Educating consumers about balanced diets and proper food preparation could help maximize the nutritional value of available food resources.

6. Strengthen partnerships: Collaborating with international organizations and neighboring countries to share knowledge, technologies, and best practices in agriculture could accelerate progress.

7. Address land reform: Implementing genuine land reform to redistribute idle lands to small farmers could increase productivity and reduce inequality in the agricultural sector.

8. Invest in research and development: Supporting scientific research on crop improvement, pest management, and climate-resilient agriculture could lead to breakthroughs in increasing yields and reducing post-harvest losses.

9. Enhance food waste reduction efforts: Initiatives to reduce food waste throughout the supply chain could help make existing resources go further.

10. Improve data collection and monitoring: Better tracking of food security indicators and early warning systems would allow for more timely interventions when needed.

Food security is not just an economic issue, but a matter of human rights and dignity. Every Filipino deserves access to nutritious food regardless of income level or geographic location. By implementing these strategies and demonstrating political will, we can move closer to achieving the goal of zero hunger and ensuring that no Filipino goes to bed hungry.

The path forward requires collaboration between government agencies, civil society organizations, private sector companies, and individual citizens. Together, we can build a more resilient food system that benefits all Filipinos and contributes to national development.",1
104,Phind Instant,"The Philippines has made significant strides in embracing digital technologies, but challenges remain in ensuring equal access to these innovations across all segments of society. As we move forward with our digital transformation goals, it's crucial that we address the persistent gaps in technology accessibility that hinder full participation in the digital economy.

According to recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, only about 70% of Filipino households have internet access at home. This leaves nearly one-third of families without reliable digital connectivity, exacerbating existing inequalities in education, healthcare, and economic opportunities [3].

To bridge this digital divide and ensure technology is truly accessible to all Filipinos, policymakers should consider several key strategies:

1. Expand rural connectivity: Investing in infrastructure projects to bring high-speed internet to underserved areas would greatly level the playing field for remote communities.

This means not just expanding our digital capabilities, but ensuring that all Filipinos have the opportunity to benefit from technological advancements regardless of their location, income level, or background.

The path forward requires collaboration between government agencies, private sector companies, civil society organizations, and individual citizens. Together, we can build a more equitable digital ecosystem where every Filipino has access to the tools and opportunities that technology provides.

Let us seize this moment to create a truly connected Philippines – one where technology serves as a force multiplier for economic growth, social progress, and human development. By doing so, we can harness the full potential of digital technologies to build a brighter future for all Filipinos.",1
105,Phind Instant,"The Philippines, known for its vibrant democracy, faces ongoing challenges in ensuring equal participation in governance. However, a new generation of young Filipinos is emerging as a powerful force in reshaping the country's political landscape. Their energy, idealism, and technological savvy are bringing fresh perspectives to the table and pushing for much-needed reforms.

Recent data reveals that over 40% of Filipinos are under 18 years old, presenting a massive demographic that could either be a blessing or a curse for the country's future [1]. However, despite their numbers, youth participation in formal political structures has traditionally been limited. This disconnect between the young majority and political power has led to frustration and disillusionment among many young Filipinos.

But change is underway. Several initiatives are working to empower youth participation in Philippine politics:

1. The Sangguniang Kabataan (SK): Local youth councils in each of the country's 42,000 barangays, giving young people a voice in local governance [1].

2. The National Youth Commission: Serving as the main policymaking body on youth issues, coordinating all youth-related institutions and programs [1].

3. The Philippine Youth Development Plan: A guiding framework for youth development programs and policies, emphasizing active youth involvement in planning and implementing initiatives [1].

These structures provide platforms for young Filipinos to engage in decision-making processes and address local and national issues. However, challenges remain. Political dynasties continue to influence many areas, limiting opportunities for genuine youth representation [1]. Additionally, lack of consistent political support and insufficient funding have hindered the operationalization of some youth initiatives, particularly in remote regions [1].

Despite these obstacles, there are encouraging signs of progress:

1. Higher representation of women as Sangguniang Kabataan officials compared to adult counterparts, suggesting efforts to empower young women in leadership roles are yielding positive outcomes [1].

2. A relatively high number of young members of parliament, with 20 out of 311 MPs below 30 years old, earning the country top scores regionally and globally [1].

3. Successful implementation of reforms aimed at strengthening meaningful youth participation, such as the SK Reform Law passed in 2015 [1].

As we move forward, it's crucial that policymakers recognize the potential of this demographic dividend. By investing in education, skills training, and civic engagement programs, we can harness the energy and creativity of young Filipinos to drive sustainable economic growth and social progress.

Moreover, technology is playing a crucial role in bridging the gap between youth and politics. Social media platforms have enabled young Filipinos to mobilize, organize, and raise awareness on issues affecting their generation [1].

However, this digital divide remains a significant challenge. Only about 70% of Filipino households have internet access at home, leaving nearly one-third without reliable digital connectivity [1]. Addressing this inequality in technology access could be crucial for leveling the playing field and ensuring equal participation in the digital economy.

In conclusion, while challenges persist, the youth of the Philippines are showing remarkable resilience and determination to shape their country's future. Their involvement in politics is not just a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for the country's continued progress. As we move forward, let us work towards creating a truly inclusive democracy where every Filipino, regardless of age, has the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our governance systems.",1

111,Phind Instant,"The Persistent Shadow of Income Inequality in the Philippines

Income inequality stands as one of the Philippines' most enduring social and economic challenges, casting a long shadow over the nation's development trajectory. Despite periods of economic growth, the gap between the wealthy elite and the struggling masses remains stark, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting the country's full potential for inclusive development.

Historical Patterns and Structural Barriers

The Philippines holds the unfortunate distinction of having the highest income inequality among ASEAN nations. This disparity is particularly evident in the distribution of wealth, where historical patterns reveal a persistent concentration of resources among the elite. As documented by the Asian Development Bank, the richest 20% of Filipino families account for approximately 53% of total family income, while the poorest 80% must share the remaining 47%.

This severe imbalance is further highlighted by the striking ratio between the wealthiest and poorest segments of society. The income of the richest 10% of households stands at nearly 20 times that of the poorest 10%, demonstrating one of the most pronounced wealth gaps in Southeast Asia.

Regional Disparities and Labor Market Dynamics

While regional differences often dominate discussions of inequality, research reveals that intraregional disparities contribute approximately 82% of overall inequality. This finding challenges conventional wisdom and suggests that solutions must focus primarily on addressing inequalities within regions rather than between them.

Labor market dynamics play a crucial role in perpetuating income inequality:

•        Labor force participation rates significantly impact inequality, contributing 15.9% to total inequality
•        Employment rates show minimal disparity between income groups, suggesting that job creation alone won't significantly reduce inequality
•        Labor productivity emerges as the primary driver of inequality, accounting for 33.4% of labor income disparities.

Agricultural Sector Challenges

The agricultural sector presents unique challenges to addressing income inequality. Land distribution remains severely skewed, with historical patterns persisting despite reform efforts. Research indicates that initial land distribution significantly influences long-term economic growth and human development performance. This perpetuates cycles of poverty among rural communities, where farmers often remain landless and vulnerable to economic shocks.

Impact on Economic Growth

Income inequality doesn't merely reflect economic challenges; it actively impedes sustainable development. High levels of inequality weaken economic growth potential and slow poverty reduction rates compared to neighboring nations. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where limited economic opportunities perpetuate inequality, which in turn constrains broader economic advancement.

Moving Forward: Recommendations for Action

Breaking this cycle of inequality requires a multi-pronged approach:

1. Education and Skills Development - Investment in human capital programs
  - Vocational training initiatives
  - Enhanced access to quality education


2. Labor Market Reform - Policies supporting labor force participation
  - Productivity-enhancing programs
  - Protection of workers' rights


3. Agricultural Sector Reform - Implementation of effective land reform programs
  - Support for small farmers
  - Modernization of agricultural practices


4. Social Protection Programs - Targeted assistance for vulnerable populations
  - Progressive taxation policies
  - Enhanced social safety nets


Conclusion

The persistence of income inequality in the Philippines represents both a moral challenge and an economic imperative. While historical patterns paint a sobering picture, understanding these dynamics provides crucial insights for policy interventions. Success will require sustained commitment to addressing structural barriers and implementing evidence-based solutions that target the root causes of inequality rather than its symptoms.

The path forward demands a comprehensive approach that acknowledges the complexity of income inequality while maintaining focus on measurable outcomes. By addressing both historical inequities and current challenges, the Philippines can work toward creating a more inclusive economy where growth benefits all segments of society, rather than merely widening existing gaps.",1

121,GPT4o-mini,"Income inequality is one of the most pressing issues in the Philippines, a country often lauded for its economic growth in recent years. Despite being one of Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economies, the benefits of growth have not been evenly distributed. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, highlighting the structural inequalities that have long plagued the nation. From disparities in wealth distribution to limited access to opportunities, income inequality has profound social, economic, and political implications for the country.

A Historical Perspective on Inequality
The roots of income inequality in the Philippines can be traced back to its colonial past. Under Spanish rule, vast tracts of land were concentrated in the hands of a few elite families, creating a feudal system where wealth and power were inherited rather than earned. This inequitable distribution of land and resources persisted through American colonization and into the modern era, where economic power remains concentrated among a small group of families and conglomerates.

Today, the top 1% of the population controls a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth. A study by Credit Suisse revealed that the richest Filipinos own nearly a third of the country's total wealth, while millions of Filipinos live below the poverty line. This concentration of wealth perpetuates a cycle of privilege, where access to quality education, healthcare, and job opportunities is reserved for the affluent.

The Urban-Rural Divide
Income inequality in the Philippines is also starkly reflected in the divide between urban and rural areas. Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao serve as economic hubs, attracting investments and offering higher wages. In contrast, many rural areas remain underdeveloped, with residents reliant on subsistence farming or low-paying informal jobs. The lack of infrastructure, limited access to markets, and inadequate government support further exacerbate rural poverty.

Agriculture, once the backbone of the Philippine economy, has been left behind in favor of industrial and service sectors. Farmers often struggle with outdated tools, insufficient capital, and vulnerability to climate change. The sector's decline has pushed many rural Filipinos to migrate to urban centers in search of better opportunities, leading to overcrowding in cities and the proliferation of informal settlements.

Education: The Great Equalizer?
Education is often cited as the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, but in the Philippines, access to quality education is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status. Public schools, while accessible, are often underfunded and overcrowded, leaving students at a disadvantage compared to their peers in private institutions. The cost of tertiary education further limits opportunities for low-income families, perpetuating the cycle of inequality.

According to a report by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), individuals with higher educational attainment are more likely to secure well-paying jobs. However, the lack of access to quality education in rural and marginalized communities prevents many Filipinos from climbing the socioeconomic ladder. This highlights the need for targeted investments in education, particularly in underprivileged areas, to create a level playing field for all.

Employment and Wage Disparities
Employment is another critical factor contributing to income inequality. While the country has seen improvements in employment rates, many Filipinos remain in low-paying and precarious jobs. The informal sector, which includes street vendors, tricycle drivers, and small-scale entrepreneurs, accounts for a significant portion of the workforce. These workers often lack job security, social protection, and opportunities for upward mobility.

Even within formal employment, wage disparities persist. Workers in urban areas earn significantly more than those in rural areas, and men typically earn higher wages than women. The minimum wage, which varies by region, is often insufficient to cover the rising cost of living, forcing many families to take on multiple jobs or rely on remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).

The Role of Government Policies
The government has introduced various policies and programs aimed at reducing income inequality, but their effectiveness has been limited. Conditional cash transfer programs like the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) have provided financial assistance to low-income families, enabling them to access education and healthcare. While these initiatives have helped alleviate poverty for some, they are not enough to address the root causes of inequality.

Tax reform is another area where the government has made strides. The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, implemented in 2018, aimed to make the tax system more equitable by lowering income taxes for low- and middle-income earners and increasing taxes on luxury goods and sugary beverages. However, critics argue that the law's regressive effects, such as higher fuel prices, have disproportionately affected the poor.

To truly address income inequality, the government must adopt a more comprehensive approach. This includes investing in rural development, expanding access to quality education and healthcare, and creating policies that promote inclusive growth. Strengthening labor protections and implementing a living wage can also help ensure that economic gains are shared more equitably.

The Social and Political Implications
Income inequality has far-reaching consequences for Philippine society. Economically, it hampers growth by limiting the purchasing power of a significant portion of the population. Socially, it fosters resentment and divides communities, creating a sense of hopelessness among the marginalized. Politically, it undermines trust in institutions and fuels populism, as people turn to leaders who promise quick fixes to systemic problems.

The 2022 elections highlighted the role of inequality in shaping political outcomes. Candidates who addressed issues of poverty and inequality resonated with voters, particularly in rural areas. However, translating campaign promises into meaningful action requires political will and a commitment to long-term reforms.

A Call to Action
Addressing income inequality in the Philippines is not an easy task, but it is essential for achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. The government, private sector, and civil society must work together to create a more equitable society where every Filipino has the opportunity to succeed. This requires bold policies, targeted investments, and a commitment to social justice.

By prioritizing education, rural development, and social protection, the Philippines can bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. Empowering marginalized communities, fostering inclusive economic growth, and promoting equitable resource distribution are crucial steps toward a more just and prosperous future. The fight against income inequality is a collective effort, and it is one that the nation cannot afford to lose.

122,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is often referred to as a nation of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). With over 1.83 million Filipinos working abroad as of 2022, OFWs are celebrated for their immense contributions to the country's economy. Their remittances are a cornerstone of the Philippine economy, sustaining millions of families and providing critical support to national development. However, while OFWs are hailed as modern-day heroes, their struggles and the deeper implications of their migration expose the vulnerabilities in the country’s economic framework.

The Economic Impact of OFW Remittances
Remittances from OFWs are among the Philippines' most vital sources of income. In 2022, personal remittances reached $36.14 billion, accounting for roughly 9% of the country's GDP. These funds bolster household consumption, enabling families to afford food, education, healthcare, and housing. Remittances also help stabilize the peso, enhance foreign exchange reserves, and provide a cushion during economic downturns, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For many families, remittances are a lifeline. They help break the cycle of poverty, allowing children to stay in school and ensuring access to better healthcare. On a larger scale, remittances fund local businesses, creating jobs and stimulating economic activity in communities across the Philippines.

However, while these benefits are undeniable, the country's dependence on OFW remittances raises critical questions about long-term sustainability. The Philippines risks relying too heavily on labor exportation as a development strategy rather than focusing on building a robust domestic economy.

The Socioeconomic Cost of Labor Migration
While OFWs contribute significantly to the economy, the personal cost of migration is often steep. Many OFWs leave their families behind, sacrificing years of presence to secure financial stability. The social impact of this separation can be profound, particularly on children who grow up without one or both parents. Studies have shown that these children are more prone to emotional and behavioral issues, despite the financial advantages provided by remittances.

OFWs also face challenges abroad, including exploitative working conditions, racial discrimination, and limited labor rights. Reports of abuse, particularly among domestic workers in the Middle East, highlight the vulnerabilities of Filipino migrants in foreign lands. Despite their invaluable contributions, OFWs often endure hardships that reveal the harsh realities of labor migration.

The Brain Drain Phenomenon
One of the unintended consequences of large-scale labor migration is the phenomenon of ""brain drain."" Many of the country's skilled professionals, including nurses, engineers, and teachers, seek better opportunities abroad due to higher wages and improved working conditions. While their remittances benefit the economy, their absence creates a talent gap in critical sectors, particularly healthcare and education.

For instance, the exodus of Filipino nurses to countries like the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom has strained the local healthcare system. Hospitals face chronic staff shortages, particularly in rural areas, where the need for medical professionals is greatest. This dynamic highlights the double-edged sword of labor migration: while it alleviates poverty for individual families, it often leaves domestic industries struggling to fill critical roles.

Government Policies and Labor Exportation
The Philippine government has institutionalized labor migration through agencies like the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA). These organizations are tasked with regulating overseas employment, protecting migrant workers’ rights, and providing welfare services.

However, critics argue that the government’s reliance on labor exportation is a band-aid solution to deeper economic issues. Instead of creating sufficient job opportunities and ensuring decent wages domestically, the government has leaned on OFW remittances to sustain the economy. This reliance underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to economic development that prioritizes local job creation and industrialization.

Efforts have been made to improve the welfare of OFWs, such as the passage of the ""Migrant Workers Act"" and the establishment of the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW). These initiatives aim to provide greater protection and support for Filipino workers abroad. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure the safety, dignity, and rights of OFWs in their host countries.

OFWs and the Philippine Middle Class
Remittances from OFWs have played a significant role in the emergence of the Philippine middle class. Many OFW families use their earnings to invest in education, small businesses, and real estate, contributing to upward social mobility. This has had a ripple effect on consumer spending, driving demand for goods and services and spurring growth in sectors like retail and real estate.

However, the middle class's growth has also exposed structural inequalities. While some families benefit from remittances, others remain trapped in poverty due to limited access to opportunities. The uneven distribution of wealth underscores the need for inclusive policies that address income inequality and create a level playing field for all Filipinos.

The Path to Sustainable Development
The Philippines must find a way to reduce its dependence on labor exportation while leveraging the benefits of OFW contributions. This requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses both the push and pull factors of migration.

Job Creation and Economic Diversification: The government must prioritize creating quality jobs at home. Investments in manufacturing, technology, and agriculture can provide sustainable employment and reduce the need for Filipinos to seek work abroad.

Improving Domestic Wages and Working Conditions: Many Filipinos migrate due to low wages and poor working conditions. By implementing policies that ensure fair wages, labor protections, and benefits, the government can make domestic employment more attractive.

Investing in Education and Skills Development: Equipping Filipinos with the skills needed for high-demand industries, both locally and globally, can enhance their earning potential and reduce reliance on low-skilled labor migration.

Supporting Return Migrants: Programs that help returning OFWs reintegrate into society and utilize their savings and skills for entrepreneurship can create a multiplier effect in the economy.

Strengthening OFW Protections: While migration remains a reality, the government must continue to advocate for the rights and welfare of Filipino workers abroad. Bilateral agreements with host countries and stronger enforcement of anti-abuse measures are critical.

A Nation of Heroes
OFWs are often called modern-day heroes for a reason. Their sacrifices and hard work sustain millions of Filipino families and contribute significantly to the national economy. However, their stories also reveal the systemic issues that need to be addressed for the Philippines to achieve sustainable and inclusive development.

The challenge lies in creating a society where Filipinos no longer feel compelled to leave their families and country in search of better opportunities. By addressing the root causes of labor migration and building a resilient domestic economy, the Philippines can honor the contributions of OFWs while paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.",1
123,GPT4o-mini,"Food security—the ability of a population to have consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food—is a fundamental human right and an essential foundation for national development. However, in the Philippines, achieving food security has remained a persistent challenge. Despite being an agricultural country with fertile lands and abundant marine resources, the nation continues to grapple with issues such as rising food prices, dependency on imports, and climate-related vulnerabilities. As the country faces these hurdles, it is clear that ensuring food security is both a pressing need and a multifaceted challenge that demands immediate and long-term solutions.

The Current State of Food Security in the Philippines
According to the 2022 Global Hunger Index, the Philippines ranks in the ""serious"" hunger category, reflecting the nation's struggle to provide adequate food for its population. Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reveals that approximately 24% of Filipino families experience food insecurity, a number that has only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, when supply chain disruptions and unemployment drastically reduced access to food.

The Philippine economy has shown remarkable resilience, but the agricultural sector, which should be a cornerstone of food security, has not kept pace with the country's growing population. Agricultural productivity remains stagnant, and the sector accounts for only 9% of the gross domestic product (GDP), despite employing nearly 25% of the workforce. This mismatch underscores the inefficiencies and structural issues within the sector.

Dependency on Food Imports: A Double-Edged Sword
One of the most concerning aspects of food security in the Philippines is its heavy reliance on food imports. Rice, a staple food for Filipinos, is a prime example. While the Philippines is one of the world's largest rice consumers, it has consistently struggled to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production. Instead, it relies on imports from countries such as Vietnam and Thailand to meet its domestic demand.

This dependency on imports leaves the country vulnerable to external shocks, such as rising global food prices and trade restrictions. For instance, the ongoing geopolitical tensions and global supply chain disruptions have caused significant spikes in the cost of imported goods, further straining the budgets of Filipino households. While the government has implemented policies to stabilize rice prices, such as the Rice Tariffication Law, these measures have had mixed results, with some farmers struggling to compete with cheaper imported rice.

Climate Change: A Growing Threat
The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, frequently hit by typhoons, droughts, and other climate-related events. These natural disasters devastate crops, disrupt food supply chains, and exacerbate food insecurity. Typhoon Odette (Rai) in 2021, for example, caused significant damage to agricultural lands, affecting millions of Filipinos' access to food.

Climate change amplifies these challenges. Rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns disrupt planting and harvesting schedules, reduce crop yields, and increase the prevalence of pests and diseases. Coastal communities, which rely on fishing for their livelihoods, are also severely affected by rising sea levels and declining fish stocks due to overfishing and marine pollution.

The Role of Government Policies
The Philippine government has launched numerous initiatives to address food security, but their effectiveness has been mixed. Programs like the ""Plant, Plant, Plant"" initiative, introduced during the pandemic, aimed to boost local food production by encouraging backyard gardening and urban agriculture. While these efforts have had localized successes, they are insufficient to address systemic issues.

The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) was another ambitious policy aimed at redistributing agricultural land to farmers. However, it has been criticized for poor implementation and lack of support for beneficiaries. Many farmers who received land titles under CARP lack access to credit, technology, and infrastructure, leaving them unable to maximize productivity.

Urbanization and Its Impact on Agriculture
Rapid urbanization has further complicated the Philippines' food security. As cities expand, agricultural lands are being converted into residential and commercial spaces. This trend not only reduces the land available for food production but also displaces farming communities, pushing them into poverty and food insecurity.

Metro Manila, for instance, has become heavily reliant on food supplies from neighboring provinces. This dependency creates logistical challenges, particularly during natural disasters or pandemics, when transportation and supply chains are disrupted.

Addressing Food Security: A Multi-Sectoral Approach
Ensuring food security in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. Here are some key strategies:

Investing in Agricultural Development
Increasing investments in the agricultural sector is crucial. This includes providing farmers with access to modern technology, improving irrigation systems, and expanding access to affordable credit. Research and development in climate-resilient crops and sustainable farming practices should also be prioritized.

Promoting Sustainable Practices
Sustainable farming and fishing practices are essential for long-term food security. Initiatives to reduce overfishing, combat marine pollution, and promote organic farming can help protect the country's natural resources and ensure their sustainability for future generations.

Strengthening Local Food Systems
Encouraging local food production through urban agriculture and community-supported farming initiatives can reduce reliance on imports and create more resilient food systems. Government programs should focus on empowering small-scale farmers and fisherfolk, who are often the most vulnerable to food insecurity.

Enhancing Climate Resilience
To mitigate the impacts of climate change, the government should invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant irrigation systems and typhoon-resistant storage facilities. Early warning systems and disaster risk reduction programs can also help protect agricultural communities.

Improving Food Distribution and Logistics
Efficient food distribution systems are critical for reducing food waste and ensuring that food reaches all regions of the country. Investments in transportation infrastructure, cold storage facilities, and digital platforms for supply chain management can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Addressing Poverty and Inequality
Tackling food insecurity requires addressing its root causes, particularly poverty and inequality. Social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, can help vulnerable families access food, while job creation and inclusive economic growth can provide long-term solutions.

The Role of the Private Sector and Civil Society
The private sector and civil society also play a critical role in addressing food security. Private companies can invest in agricultural innovation, create market opportunities for small-scale farmers, and adopt sustainable practices. Civil society organizations can advocate for policy reforms, provide technical assistance to farmers, and raise awareness about food security issues.

A Call to Action
Food security is not just a matter of economic growth or agricultural output; it is a matter of human dignity and national stability. The Philippines has the potential to overcome its food security challenges, but doing so requires collective action from the government, private sector, and civil society.

As the country moves forward, it must prioritize policies and programs that address the root causes of food insecurity while building a more sustainable and resilient food system. The goal should not just be to feed the nation but to nourish it, ensuring that every Filipino has access to the food they need to lead healthy and productive lives.

The time to act is now. Ensuring food security is not just an economic imperative—it is a moral one. By working together, the Philippines can build a future where no one goes hungry, and every Filipino can enjoy the benefits of a truly food-secure nation.",1
124,GPT4o-mini,"The Accessibility of Technology in the Philippines: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities

Digital literacy programs are needed to educate users on topics such as online safety, e-commerce, and basic IT skills.

Policy and Regulation Issues:
Bureaucratic red tape and inconsistent policies have slowed down efforts to expand connectivity. Delays in granting permits for cell tower construction and spectrum allocation have hampered the efforts of telecom companies to improve their services.

Opportunities for Improvement

Despite these challenges, the Philippines presents numerous opportunities to improve technological accessibility and inclusivity.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):
Collaboration between the government and private sector players can accelerate the rollout of digital infrastructure. Initiatives such as the ""Free Wi-Fi for All"" project by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) aim to provide internet access to underserved areas through public Wi-Fi hotspots.

5G Expansion:
The introduction of 5G technology presents an opportunity to revolutionize connectivity in the Philippines. Faster internet speeds and lower latency can support innovations in telemedicine, online education, and e-commerce, particularly in underserved communities.

Affordable Financing Options:
Telecom companies and financial institutions can work together to provide installment plans and microfinancing solutions that make smartphones and data plans more accessible to lower-income individuals.

Community-Based Digital Training:
NGOs and educational institutions can play a vital role in providing grassroots-level training programs that focus on digital literacy, helping bridge the knowledge gap and enabling Filipinos to participate fully in the digital economy.

Localized Solutions:
Technology companies can develop localized apps and platforms that cater to the unique needs of Filipino users, such as content in local languages, financial inclusion tools, and services tailored for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

The Role of Government Initiatives

The Philippine government has taken proactive steps to improve technological accessibility, recognizing its importance for economic growth and social development. Initiatives such as the National Broadband Plan (NBP) aim to expand internet coverage and lower costs by developing a national fiber optic backbone. Meanwhile, the recently passed SIM Card Registration Act and the push for digital ID systems under the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) are steps towards enhancing cybersecurity and streamlining access to online services.

Conclusion

The accessibility of technology in the Philippines is a story of both remarkable progress and persistent challenges. While millions of Filipinos have embraced the digital age, gaps in infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy continue to hinder full inclusion. To ensure that all Filipinos can reap the benefits of digital transformation, a concerted effort from the government, private sector, and civil society is needed. With strategic investments and targeted policies, the Philippines has the potential to bridge the digital divide and create a more inclusive and connected future for all its citizens.",1
125,GPT4o-mini,"The youth of the Philippines have long been considered the hope of the nation. As inheritors of the country's future, they play a pivotal role in shaping its political landscape. In recent years, the involvement of young Filipinos in political discourse, activism, and governance has grown significantly, reflecting their desire to create meaningful change. Their influence extends beyond traditional political avenues, embracing digital platforms and grassroots movements to drive social and political transformation.

Historical Involvement of Filipino Youth in Politics

Throughout Philippine history, the youth have been instrumental in key political movements. The Katipunan, a secret revolutionary society that fought against Spanish colonization, was founded by young revolutionaries like Andres Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto. Decades later, during the Martial Law era in the 1970s, student activists courageously voiced their opposition to the Marcos dictatorship, organizing protests and demanding democratic reforms.

Fast forward to the present day, and the Filipino youth continue to wield significant political influence. The 2016 and 2022 national elections saw record-breaking youth voter registration and participation, highlighting their increasing interest in shaping the country's leadership and policies.

The Digital Revolution and Political Awareness

One of the most profound ways in which the youth have influenced Philippine politics is through digital platforms. Social media has become a powerful tool for political engagement, enabling young Filipinos to stay informed, share their views, and mobilize others. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become battlegrounds for political discourse, fact-checking, and advocacy.

Digital activism has empowered the youth to challenge misinformation, hold leaders accountable, and push for transparency in governance. Online campaigns addressing issues such as climate change, corruption, and human rights violations have gained traction, often leading to real-world actions and policy discussions.

Youth Participation in Governance

Beyond social media activism, young Filipinos are increasingly entering the realm of governance and policymaking. Youth-led organizations and initiatives have emerged to bridge the gap between government and the younger generation. The Sangguniang Kabataan (SK), a youth council within local government units, serves as an avenue for young leaders to engage in public service and policymaking.

While the SK has faced criticism for inefficiency and corruption, recent reforms aim to improve its credibility and effectiveness. With proper guidance and genuine commitment, the youth can harness the potential of the SK to address community issues and advocate for meaningful policies.

Challenges Facing the Youth in Political Engagement

Despite their enthusiasm and potential, the youth face numerous challenges in their political involvement. Misinformation, political disillusionment, and economic constraints often hinder their ability to engage effectively. Some young Filipinos feel discouraged by systemic corruption and the perception that their voices are not being heard.

Additionally, the commercialization of politics and the prevalence of traditional political dynasties present barriers to genuine youth representation. Overcoming these challenges requires sustained efforts in political education, capacity-building, and the promotion of youth-centric policies.

The Way Forward: Empowering the Filipino Youth

To maximize the impact of youth in shaping Philippine politics, various stakeholders must collaborate in fostering an environment that nurtures their political engagement. Schools and universities should strengthen civic education programs, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to critically analyze political issues and engage in constructive dialogue.

Moreover, policymakers and civil society organizations must create more platforms for youth participation in decision-making processes. Encouraging mentorship programs, youth summits, and policy dialogues can help bridge the gap between young people and political leaders.

Lastly, the youth themselves must continue to embrace their role as catalysts for change. Whether through activism, public service, or community involvement, their collective efforts can drive the Philippines toward a more inclusive and progressive political landscape.

Conclusion

The Filipino youth are not just the future of the nation; they are its present. Their growing influence in shaping Philippine politics is a testament to their passion, resilience, and commitment to a better tomorrow. With their continued engagement and empowerment, they hold the power to transform the country's political system and pave the way for a more just and democratic society.",1
126,GPT4o-mini,"The Case for Federalism in the Philippines: A Path to Decentralization and Regional Empowerment

The debate over federalism in the Philippines has been a recurring theme in the nation’s political discourse. As a country with a unitary form of government, power is heavily concentrated in Metro Manila, leaving the regions with limited autonomy and resources. Proponents argue that shifting to a federal system would address long-standing issues of uneven development, bureaucratic inefficiency, and regional neglect. However, critics fear that it may lead to greater disparities and even political instability. As the debate continues, it is essential to explore the merits and challenges of federalism in the Philippine context and examine whether it is the right path for the nation.

Understanding Federalism

Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and regional governments. Countries like the United States, Germany, Canada, and Australia operate under this system, allowing states or provinces to have significant control over their own policies, economy, and governance. In contrast, the Philippines follows a unitary form of government, where decision-making is largely concentrated in the national government based in Metro Manila. While local governments have some degree of autonomy through the Local Government Code of 1991, their fiscal and political powers remain limited.

Why Federalism?

1. Decentralization of Power

One of the most significant arguments in favor of federalism is the decentralization of power. The current centralized system places much of the decision-making authority in the hands of national agencies, often leading to inefficiencies and neglect of local concerns. A federal system would grant regional governments the ability to craft policies tailored to their unique economic, social, and cultural contexts. This would empower local leaders to address issues more effectively without excessive dependence on the national government.

2. Economic Development and Regional Growth

The Philippines has long suffered from the problem of economic inequality, with Metro Manila enjoying the bulk of investments and development while other regions lag behind. Under federalism, each region would have more control over its own economy, taxation, and resource allocation. This could lead to more balanced economic growth, as regions would have the incentive to develop their industries, attract investments, and improve infrastructure based on their own needs and strengths.

3. Improved Public Services

Under a federal setup, regional governments would have greater control over public services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. This could lead to more efficient service delivery, as policies would be crafted to address local concerns rather than being dictated by a centralized authority that may not fully grasp the unique challenges faced by different regions. Additionally, reducing bureaucratic red tape could facilitate faster and more responsive governance.

4. Addressing Historical Grievances

Certain regions, particularly Mindanao, have long called for greater autonomy due to historical and cultural differences. The current Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is an example of how granting autonomy can lead to more effective governance and peace-building efforts. Expanding this model to the entire country through federalism may help resolve long-standing grievances and conflicts, leading to greater national unity.

The Challenges of Federalism

While federalism presents several potential benefits, it is not without risks and challenges. Critics argue that shifting to a federal system could exacerbate existing problems rather than solve them.

1. Risk of Widening Regional Disparities

One of the primary concerns is that wealthier regions, such as Metro Manila and Cebu, may prosper under federalism while poorer regions struggle due to limited resources. Without a proper equalization mechanism, federalism could further entrench economic inequalities instead of alleviating them. Ensuring that all regions have the capacity to govern effectively will require significant planning and resource allocation.

2. Potential for Political Dynasties and Corruption

The Philippines has a long history of political dynasties, particularly at the local level. Under a federal system, these dynasties may gain even more power, as regional governments would have increased control over taxation, law enforcement, and development projects. If not properly regulated, this could lead to an increase in corruption and misuse of public funds.

3. Transition Costs and Implementation Challenges

Transitioning to a federal government would require massive structural changes, including amending the Constitution, reorganizing government agencies, and redistributing resources. This process would be costly and time-consuming, potentially causing economic disruptions in the short term. Additionally, determining how resources and powers will be distributed among the regions will be a complex task that could lead to political conflicts.

4. Threats to National Unity

Some critics fear that federalism may lead to a weakening of national identity and even potential secessionist movements. If not properly managed, increased regional autonomy might encourage separatist tendencies, particularly in historically distinct areas like Mindanao. Safeguards must be put in place to maintain national cohesion while allowing for regional self-governance.

The Road Ahead: A Pragmatic Approach

Given the potential benefits and risks of federalism, any move toward this system must be approached with careful planning and national consensus. Several steps must be taken to ensure that the transition is smooth and beneficial to all regions:

Public Awareness and Dialogue – The public must be well-informed about federalism, its implications, and its potential impact on their daily lives. Extensive consultations with stakeholders, including local governments, businesses, and civil society, should be conducted.

Gradual Decentralization – Instead of an immediate overhaul, the government can gradually increase regional autonomy through amendments to existing laws, strengthening local governance, and improving fiscal management at the local level.

Anti-Corruption Safeguards – Strict regulations must be implemented to prevent abuse of power by local politicians. Transparency measures, independent audits, and strong legal frameworks should be in place to combat corruption.

Equalization Mechanisms – Federalism should include mechanisms to ensure that poorer regions receive adequate support to develop and compete with wealthier regions. A national equalization fund could be established to distribute resources more equitably.

Legal and Constitutional Reforms – A well-crafted constitutional amendment must clearly define the powers, responsibilities, and limitations of regional governments to avoid ambiguity and potential conflicts.

Conclusion

The push for federalism in the Philippines is driven by the need for regional empowerment, economic balance, and improved governance. While the system offers promising advantages, it also carries significant risks that must be carefully addressed. A successful transition would require a well-thought-out approach that includes legal reforms, institutional safeguards, and extensive public engagement. Federalism is not a silver bullet for the country’s problems, but if implemented correctly, it could be a transformative step toward a more inclusive and equitable Philippines.",1
127,GPT4o-mini,"Ensuring Financial Transparency in Philippine Election Campaigns: A Call for Reform

Election campaigns in the Philippines are often characterized by grand rallies, extensive advertisements, and large-scale mobilizations. However, the financial mechanisms behind these campaigns remain opaque, raising concerns over transparency, accountability, and potential corruption. The lack of strict enforcement of campaign finance regulations has allowed questionable donations, excessive spending, and illicit funding sources to persist. Addressing these issues is critical to ensuring that Philippine democracy remains fair, transparent, and free from undue influence.

The State of Campaign Finance Transparency in the Philippines

Under Philippine law, candidates and political parties are required to submit Statements of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE) to the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). These reports should disclose sources of campaign funds, how they were spent, and whether expenditures stayed within legal limits. However, in practice, compliance with these regulations is weak, and enforcement mechanisms are insufficient. Many candidates fail to submit accurate reports, and penalties for non-compliance are often minimal or inconsistently applied.

Key Issues in Campaign Finance Transparency

1. Lack of Accountability in Fundraising

Campaigns in the Philippines rely heavily on private donations, including contributions from business interests, political allies, and sometimes even illicit sources. The lack of strict auditing makes it difficult to determine whether these funds come from legal and ethical sources. This opacity creates opportunities for corruption and potential conflicts of interest, as politicians may feel indebted to wealthy donors once in office.

2. Undisclosed or Underreported Spending

Despite the legal requirement to disclose campaign expenditures, many candidates underreport their actual spending. The use of unofficial or third-party funding mechanisms allows candidates to bypass legal spending limits. For example, campaign ads, logistics, and grassroots mobilization efforts are sometimes funded by supporters without being formally declared, making it challenging to track the true cost of elections.

3. Vote-Buying and Election Fraud

One of the most persistent issues in Philippine elections is vote-buying, which is often facilitated through undisclosed campaign funds. Despite legal prohibitions, reports of money, goods, or services being distributed in exchange for votes remain widespread. The secrecy surrounding campaign finances makes it difficult to trace the origins of funds used in such illicit activities.

4. Weak Enforcement of Campaign Finance Laws

COMELEC is tasked with regulating campaign finances, but it lacks the necessary resources and authority to conduct thorough investigations and impose stringent penalties. Political considerations and limited funding further hamper its ability to effectively monitor and enforce compliance. As a result, many violations go unpunished, encouraging continued financial misconduct in elections.

The Need for Reform

To ensure fair and transparent elections, the Philippine government must undertake significant reforms to strengthen campaign finance regulations and enforcement mechanisms. Several steps can be taken to address the existing issues:

Strengthening COMELEC’s Oversight Powers – Providing COMELEC with enhanced authority to conduct real-time audits, investigate discrepancies, and impose stricter penalties would deter non-compliance and financial malpractice.

Mandatory Public Disclosure of Campaign Finances – Requiring candidates and political parties to publish their campaign finance reports in easily accessible platforms would increase transparency and allow the public to scrutinize political funding.

Independent Financial Audits – Establishing independent oversight bodies to review campaign expenditures and donations would help ensure accuracy in reporting and compliance with legal spending limits.

Limiting Corporate and Foreign Donations – Implementing stricter regulations on corporate and foreign contributions would reduce the risk of undue influence and conflicts of interest in government policies.

Criminalizing Vote-Buying with Harsher Penalties – Strengthening anti-vote-buying laws and increasing penalties for violators, including candidates who engage in such practices, would help curb electoral fraud.

Public Funding for Campaigns – Introducing a system of public funding for elections could reduce reliance on private donors, ensuring a more level playing field for all candidates.

Conclusion

The need for greater financial transparency in Philippine election campaigns cannot be overstated. Without stronger regulations and enforcement mechanisms, the electoral process remains vulnerable to corruption, undue influence, and fraudulent practices. Implementing meaningful reforms in campaign finance laws is essential to fostering a more transparent, accountable, and democratic political system. It is time for policymakers, civil society, and the public to demand greater financial integrity in elections to uphold the principles of fair and honest governance.",1
128,GPT4o-mini,"Breaking the Stigma: Addressing Mental Health in the Philippines

Mental health remains one of the most misunderstood and overlooked aspects of healthcare in the Philippines. Despite increasing awareness, stigma continues to persist, preventing many Filipinos from seeking help and receiving adequate support. Cultural attitudes, lack of education, and limited access to mental health services contribute to this ongoing crisis. Addressing the stigma surrounding mental health is crucial in fostering a society that values the well-being of all its citizens.

Understanding the Mental Health Stigma in the Philippines

Mental health stigma in the country is deeply rooted in traditional beliefs and cultural misconceptions. Many Filipinos associate mental illness with weakness, laziness, or even supernatural causes. This results in widespread discrimination against individuals struggling with mental health conditions, making them hesitant to speak openly about their experiences or seek professional help.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Philippines has one of the highest rates of depression in Southeast Asia, yet mental health remains a low priority in the national healthcare system. The lack of awareness and the fear of being judged or ostracized often lead individuals to suffer in silence, further exacerbating their condition.

Key Challenges in Overcoming Mental Health Stigma

1. Cultural Misconceptions and Discrimination

Mental illness is often viewed as a sign of personal failure rather than a medical condition. Many Filipinos believe that individuals suffering from mental health issues should simply ""snap out of it"" or ""pray harder."" This dismissive attitude discourages open discussions about mental health and reinforces feelings of shame among those affected.

2. Lack of Mental Health Education

There is a significant lack of awareness and education about mental health in the Philippines. Many schools and workplaces do not offer mental health programs, leaving individuals uninformed about the importance of psychological well-being. The absence of education contributes to the perpetuation of myths and misconceptions surrounding mental health disorders.

3. Limited Access to Mental Health Services

Despite the passage of the Mental Health Act in 2018, access to mental health services remains inadequate, especially in rural areas. The country faces a severe shortage of mental health professionals, with only a small number of psychiatrists and psychologists available to serve a population of over 110 million people. High consultation fees and the stigma associated with seeking therapy further discourage individuals from seeking help.

4. Discrimination in the Workplace and Schools

Mental health stigma extends to workplaces and educational institutions, where individuals with mental health issues often face discrimination. Many employers and school administrators lack the knowledge and policies to support those struggling with mental health conditions. Fear of losing a job or being labeled as ""unstable"" prevents many from disclosing their struggles or asking for accommodations.

Steps Towards Breaking the Stigma

To create a more inclusive and supportive society, the Philippines must take proactive measures to break the stigma surrounding mental health. Here are some key steps that can be taken:

Promoting Mental Health Education – Integrating mental health awareness programs into school curriculums and workplace policies can help educate individuals about the importance of psychological well-being and dispel common misconceptions.

Increasing Access to Mental Health Services – Expanding mental health facilities, hiring more professionals, and providing affordable therapy options can make mental healthcare more accessible to all Filipinos.

Encouraging Open Conversations – Public figures, influencers, and media outlets should use their platforms to normalize discussions on mental health, encouraging individuals to share their experiences without fear of judgment.

Strengthening Workplace and School Policies – Implementing mental health-friendly policies in schools and workplaces, such as counseling services, mental health days, and support groups, can help create safe environments for those struggling.

Supporting Legislation and Government Initiatives – The government should allocate more funding to mental health programs and ensure the full implementation of the Mental Health Act, making mental healthcare a national priority.

Combating Discrimination – Strict anti-discrimination laws should be enforced to protect individuals with mental health conditions from workplace bias, school bullying, and social exclusion.

Conclusion

The stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines remains a significant barrier to progress. However, through education, policy reforms, and collective societal efforts, change is possible. It is time for Filipinos to break the silence, challenge misconceptions, and foster a culture of empathy and understanding. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and every individual deserves access to proper care and support. By working together, the nation can build a future where mental well-being is valued, and no one has to suffer in silence.",1
129,GPT4o-mini,"Urban Congestion and Housing Shortages in the Philippines: A Growing Crisis

The Philippines is facing an escalating urban congestion and housing crisis, particularly in major metropolitan areas such as Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao. With rapid population growth, rural-to-urban migration, and inefficient urban planning, the country struggles to provide adequate housing and infrastructure for its growing urban population. The result is overcrowded cities, worsening traffic congestion, and an increasing number of informal settlers living in substandard conditions. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach that combines better urban planning, investment in infrastructure, and policies that promote sustainable housing development.

The Root Causes of Urban Congestion and Housing Shortages

1. Rapid Urbanization and Population Growth

The Philippines has one of the fastest-growing populations in Southeast Asia, with millions of Filipinos moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities. This rapid urbanization has outpaced the development of necessary infrastructure, leading to congestion and housing shortages in major urban centers.

2. Inadequate Urban Planning

Many Philippine cities lack comprehensive and sustainable urban planning. Unregulated urban sprawl, poor land-use policies, and inefficient zoning regulations have resulted in chaotic cityscapes, where business districts, residential areas, and industrial zones are poorly integrated. The absence of long-term planning has led to high-density living conditions and worsening traffic problems.

3. High Cost of Housing

Affordable housing remains out of reach for many Filipinos, particularly for minimum-wage earners. The rising cost of land and real estate development has made homeownership an unattainable dream for many urban dwellers. As a result, low-income families resort to informal settlements, where they lack access to basic services such as clean water, electricity, and sanitation.

4. Proliferation of Informal Settlements

With limited access to affordable housing, many Filipinos have no choice but to settle in slums and informal settlements. These areas are often located in hazardous zones—under bridges, near railways, or along riverbanks—making residents vulnerable to natural disasters and displacement. Government relocation programs have historically struggled to provide sustainable alternatives, often moving communities to distant relocation sites with little access to jobs or public transportation.

5. Severe Traffic Congestion

Urban congestion in the Philippines is not just about housing; traffic gridlock is one of the most visible consequences. Metro Manila consistently ranks among the most traffic-congested cities in the world, with commuters spending hours on the road daily. Poor public transportation, inadequate road networks, and inefficient traffic management exacerbate the problem, reducing productivity and economic growth.

The Social and Economic Impact

The consequences of urban congestion and housing shortages are far-reaching. The lack of adequate housing contributes to social inequality, as informal settlers remain marginalized and deprived of essential services. Meanwhile, traffic congestion affects both individuals and businesses, resulting in lost economic opportunities and increased transportation costs. Public health is also at risk, as overcrowded living conditions and pollution contribute to higher incidences of respiratory diseases and mental health issues.

Strategies for Sustainable Urban Development

1. Improving Urban Planning and Zoning Laws

The government must enforce stricter urban planning policies to regulate land use and prevent unplanned urban sprawl. Smart city planning, which incorporates efficient transportation networks, green spaces, and mixed-use developments, should be prioritized.

2. Investing in Affordable Housing

The government and private sector must work together to develop more affordable housing projects. Subsidized housing programs, rent-to-own schemes, and incentives for developers to build low-cost housing can help address the growing demand.

3. Upgrading Public Transportation

Expanding and modernizing public transportation systems, including railways, buses, and alternative transport modes, can help alleviate congestion. Projects such as the Metro Manila Subway and expanded railway networks should be fast-tracked to improve mobility and reduce dependence on private vehicles.

4. Developing Secondary Cities

Decentralization efforts should encourage investment in secondary cities to reduce overpopulation in Metro Manila and other major urban areas. By promoting economic development in regional hubs, the government can create more job opportunities outside the capital, easing migration pressures.

5. Implementing Slum Upgrading Programs

Instead of forced evictions, the government should focus on upgrading informal settlements by providing basic services, improving infrastructure, and integrating these communities into the formal housing market.

Conclusion

Urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines are critical issues that require immediate and long-term solutions. Through better urban planning, investment in infrastructure, and policies that promote equitable housing access, the country can create livable cities that offer better opportunities for all. It is time for a collective effort from the government, private sector, and civil society to address these challenges and build a future where every Filipino has access to decent housing and efficient urban mobility.",1
130,GPT4o-mini,"Tackling Plastic Pollution in the Philippines: A Call for Urgent Action

Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues in the Philippines, threatening marine ecosystems, public health, and the economy. With the country ranked among the world’s top contributors to ocean plastic waste, urgent and sustained action is needed to address this crisis. Despite various government policies and initiatives, plastic waste continues to accumulate in waterways, landfills, and communities, exacerbating climate change and biodiversity loss.

The Scope of the Problem

The Philippines generates approximately 2.7 million metric tons of plastic waste annually, with an estimated 20% ending up in the ocean. The country’s heavy reliance on single-use plastics, such as sachets, straws, and plastic bags, has significantly contributed to the growing plastic waste problem. Poor waste management infrastructure, coupled with a lack of proper recycling facilities, has made it difficult to mitigate plastic pollution effectively.

Key Factors Contributing to Plastic Pollution

1. Widespread Use of Single-Use Plastics

The Filipino consumer market is dominated by single-use plastic packaging, particularly in the form of sachets and small plastic containers used for food, toiletries, and household products. These are popular due to their affordability, but they contribute significantly to plastic waste because they are rarely recycled.

2. Inefficient Waste Management System

Many parts of the Philippines lack proper waste disposal and recycling infrastructure. Inadequate collection systems, limited landfill space, and ineffective waste segregation practices lead to plastic waste being dumped into rivers, which eventually carry it to the ocean.

3. Lack of Policy Implementation

While the Philippines has environmental laws such as the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (RA 9003) and the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) law, enforcement remains weak. Many local governments struggle with implementation due to budget constraints and lack of technical expertise.

4. Corporate Responsibility and Greenwashing

Many large corporations contribute to the plastic crisis by producing massive amounts of plastic packaging. While some companies have initiated sustainability programs, critics argue that these efforts often fall under “greenwashing,” where businesses appear environmentally responsible without making significant changes to their production processes.

Environmental and Economic Impacts

Plastic pollution is not just an environmental issue; it has direct economic and social consequences. The damage to marine ecosystems affects the country’s fishing industry, which supports millions of Filipinos. Plastic waste also clogs drainage systems, exacerbating flooding in urban areas. Additionally, microplastics have been found in food and water sources, posing serious health risks to the population.

Solutions and Recommendations

Addressing plastic pollution in the Philippines requires a multi-sectoral approach involving the government, private sector, and civil society. Here are some key measures that can help mitigate the crisis:

1. Strengthening Policy Enforcement

The government must enhance the enforcement of existing laws, such as RA 9003, and impose stricter regulations on single-use plastics. Local governments should also be empowered with the resources needed to implement waste management programs effectively.

2. Encouraging Sustainable Packaging Alternatives

Businesses should transition towards eco-friendly packaging solutions, such as biodegradable materials, refillable containers, and reusable packaging systems. Incentives should be provided to companies that adopt sustainable practices.

3. Expanding Recycling Infrastructure

Investment in waste management infrastructure, including modern recycling facilities and waste-to-energy plants, is essential. Encouraging public participation in waste segregation and recycling programs can also improve efficiency.

4. Promoting Public Awareness and Behavioral Change

Educational campaigns should be intensified to change consumer behavior towards responsible plastic use and waste disposal. Schools, businesses, and communities must be involved in promoting sustainable practices.

5. Corporate Accountability and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)

Manufacturers and corporations must take responsibility for the waste generated by their products. The full implementation of the EPR law should ensure that producers are responsible for the collection and proper disposal of their plastic packaging.

Conclusion

Plastic pollution in the Philippines is a growing crisis that requires immediate and sustained action. By enforcing stronger regulations, investing in waste management infrastructure, and fostering a culture of environmental responsibility, the country can reduce its plastic waste and protect its natural resources for future generations. The fight against plastic pollution is not just the responsibility of the government but of every Filipino. It is time to take action before the problem becomes irreversible.",1
131,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is a nation of contrasts. Its economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience, boasting steady GDP growth over the past decades. Major urban centers like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have become hubs for commerce, technology, and innovation. Yet, beneath these economic achievements lies a persistent and growing issue: income inequality.

The Stark Divide Between Rich and Poor

Despite progress in economic development, the wealth gap in the Philippines remains significant. According to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), income disparities are evident across regions, social classes, and employment sectors. The richest 10% of Filipinos continue to amass a disproportionate share of the country's wealth, while millions of Filipinos struggle to make ends meet.

The pandemic exacerbated this divide. The lockdowns disproportionately affected low-income workers, many of whom were employed in the informal sector without social safety nets. Meanwhile, large corporations and high-income earners were better equipped to weather the crisis, benefiting from remote work setups and digital commerce.

Root Causes of Income Inequality

Unequal Access to Education and OpportunitiesEducation remains one of the strongest indicators of economic mobility. However, quality education is not easily accessible to all Filipinos. Wealthier families can afford private schooling and international education, ensuring better job prospects for their children. In contrast, many public schools struggle with underfunding, leading to a cycle where underprivileged children have fewer opportunities to advance.

Regional Economic DisparitiesEconomic growth is often concentrated in urban areas, while rural communities—where a large portion of the population resides—lag behind. The agriculture sector, which employs millions, remains underdeveloped, with farmers earning far less than their urban counterparts. Infrastructure gaps and limited access to financial services hinder rural communities from fully participating in economic growth.

Job Market Inequality and Wage DisparitiesThe job market in the Philippines favors those with higher educational attainment and connections to established networks. While the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry has created well-paying jobs, other sectors, such as manufacturing and agriculture, remain stagnant in terms of wages. The minimum wage also varies across regions, with Metro Manila workers earning significantly more than those in the provinces.

Weak Labor Protections and Informal EmploymentA significant portion of Filipino workers are in informal employment, meaning they lack access to job security, healthcare, and retirement benefits. This sector includes street vendors, tricycle drivers, and domestic workers, who often earn below the living wage. Without formal protections, these workers remain vulnerable to economic shocks.

Political and Economic Elites’ InfluenceEconomic power in the Philippines is concentrated among a few elite families and business conglomerates. This concentration of wealth influences policymaking, often leading to laws and regulations that favor big businesses over the working class. Corruption and patronage politics further entrench economic disparities.

The Consequences of Widening Income Inequality

If left unaddressed, income inequality can lead to dire consequences for the country’s long-term stability and development. Social unrest is a potential outcome, as economic frustration fuels protests and demands for systemic change. Additionally, a significant portion of the population struggling with poverty means lower consumer spending, hindering economic expansion.

Moreover, income inequality contributes to brain drain. Skilled professionals often seek opportunities abroad due to limited career growth and lower wages in the Philippines. This loss of talent weakens industries that are crucial to national development, such as healthcare and engineering.

Bridging the Gap: Policy Recommendations

Invest in Education and Skills TrainingThe government must prioritize education reforms that enhance access to quality schooling for all, particularly in rural areas. Scholarship programs, vocational training, and digital literacy initiatives can help equip workers with skills relevant to modern industries.

Strengthen Labor Laws and Social ProtectionPolicies ensuring fair wages, job security, and benefits for informal workers are necessary. Expanding the coverage of social security and healthcare programs will provide a safety net for vulnerable populations.

Promote Inclusive Economic GrowthDeveloping rural economies through investments in infrastructure, agriculture, and digital connectivity can help bridge the gap between urban and rural incomes. Supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and encouraging entrepreneurship can also create more opportunities for upward mobility.

Enforce Progressive TaxationImplementing higher taxes on the wealthy and ensuring corporations pay their fair share can help fund social programs that benefit the poor. Proper tax collection and eliminating loopholes will be crucial in achieving this.

Combat Corruption and Strengthen GovernanceEnsuring transparency in government spending and preventing corruption can redirect resources toward essential services that help reduce inequality. Strengthening institutions that uphold democratic processes will also ensure that economic policies serve the interests of the majority, not just the elite.

A Call for Collective Action

Addressing income inequality in the Philippines requires collective effort from the government, private sector, and civil society. Economic growth should not just benefit the privileged few—it must translate to better opportunities and improved living conditions for all Filipinos.

The road ahead is challenging, but with the right policies and commitment, the Philippines can move toward a more equitable society. A nation’s true progress is not measured solely by its GDP but by the well-being of its people, especially its most vulnerable citizens. It is time to take meaningful steps to bridge the wealth gap and build a more inclusive future for all.

132,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is often recognized as one of the world’s largest labor exporters, with millions of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) scattered across various countries. Their contributions to the economy are undeniable, as remittances from OFWs form a crucial pillar of national development. While their economic impact is often highlighted, the struggles and sacrifices of these workers must also be examined to create policies that protect and empower them.

The Economic Significance of OFWs

For decades, the Philippine economy has relied on the financial support of its migrant workers. In 2022, remittances from OFWs reached over $36 billion, accounting for approximately 9% of the country’s GDP. These funds provide for families back home, boosting household consumption, real estate investment, education, and small businesses.

The money sent home by OFWs supports millions of Filipino families, helping them afford better healthcare, education, and a higher standard of living. This financial flow also fuels domestic spending, creating a ripple effect that benefits various industries, from retail and construction to banking and tourism.

Additionally, OFWs alleviate domestic unemployment. With limited job opportunities and often insufficient wages in the Philippines, working abroad allows many Filipinos to earn substantially more, improving their financial well-being while also lessening pressure on the domestic labor market.

Challenges Faced by OFWs

Despite their invaluable contributions, OFWs face numerous difficulties, from exploitation to family separation. Many OFWs endure long working hours, poor living conditions, and abuse from employers. Reports of maltreatment, wage theft, and even human trafficking highlight the vulnerabilities of Filipino migrant workers, particularly those in domestic and construction sectors.

Family separation is another critical issue. Many OFWs spend years—sometimes decades—away from their loved ones. This distance can strain relationships, affect the upbringing of children, and lead to social challenges such as the so-called ""OFW phenomenon,"" where families struggle with absentee parenting and emotional disconnection.

Another significant concern is the dependency on remittances. While these funds are crucial for daily survival, they do not always translate into long-term financial stability. Many OFW families become overly reliant on remittances, failing to invest in sustainable income sources. This dependency creates a cycle where future generations also seek work abroad, perpetuating labor migration as a necessity rather than a choice.

Government Policies and Support for OFWs

Recognizing the contributions and struggles of OFWs, the Philippine government has implemented various policies to safeguard their welfare. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) oversee programs to protect and assist Filipino workers abroad. These include pre-departure orientations, legal assistance, and financial aid for repatriated OFWs.

However, despite these efforts, gaps remain in ensuring the long-term well-being of OFWs. Strengthening diplomatic ties with host countries, enforcing stricter regulations against abusive employers, and expanding reintegration programs for returning OFWs are essential steps in improving their conditions.

Reintegration and Sustainable Economic Plans

One of the most pressing challenges is ensuring that OFWs have opportunities upon their return to the Philippines. Many returning OFWs struggle with reintegration, often finding it difficult to secure stable jobs or start businesses after years of working abroad.

To address this, the government must invest in reintegration programs that provide financial literacy training, skills development, and entrepreneurial support. Encouraging OFWs to invest their earnings in sustainable ventures will help break the cycle of overseas labor migration.

Additionally, creating more local job opportunities by boosting industries such as manufacturing, agriculture, and technology will lessen the need for Filipinos to seek work abroad. Strengthening the local economy through infrastructure projects and foreign investments can provide higher wages and better working conditions, making migration a choice rather than an economic necessity.

Conclusion

OFWs play an indispensable role in sustaining the Philippine economy, yet their contributions often come at a high personal cost. While remittances fuel growth, they should not be seen as a long-term solution to economic stability. The government must prioritize policies that protect OFWs abroad and create viable opportunities at home, ensuring that Filipinos can thrive without having to leave their families behind.

A sustainable future for the Philippines means not just celebrating the sacrifices of OFWs but also crafting a nation where working abroad is an option, not a necessity. Through comprehensive policies, economic diversification, and strengthened labor protections, the country can transition towards a more self-sufficient economy—one that values both its workforce and its long-term prosperity.

133,GPT4o-mini,"Food security remains a pressing issue in the Philippines, affecting millions of Filipinos across urban and rural areas. Despite being an agricultural country, the Philippines faces persistent challenges in ensuring access to sufficient, nutritious, and affordable food. Climate change, inadequate agricultural policies, and economic disparities continue to threaten food security, making it imperative for the government and society to take urgent action.

The State of Food Security in the Philippines

The Global Hunger Index ranks the Philippines as a country with a ""serious"" level of hunger. Many Filipinos, particularly those in low-income households, struggle to afford three meals a day. Malnutrition and undernourishment remain widespread, especially among children, contributing to stunted growth and developmental issues.

Despite the country's fertile lands, food production has not kept pace with the growing population. The reliance on food imports for staples such as rice further exacerbates vulnerabilities, as global market fluctuations and supply chain disruptions can lead to price hikes and shortages.

Factors Contributing to Food Insecurity

Climate Change and Natural DisastersThe Philippines is highly vulnerable to typhoons, droughts, and other extreme weather events that disrupt agricultural production. Flooding and soil degradation decrease crop yields, making farming increasingly unpredictable and unsustainable for many rural communities.

Declining Agricultural ProductivityThe country’s agricultural sector has suffered from underinvestment, outdated farming techniques, and a lack of support for small-scale farmers. Many farmers struggle with low incomes, forcing younger generations to seek work in urban centers rather than continue farming.

Heavy Reliance on ImportsThe Philippines imports large quantities of rice, wheat, and other essential commodities. This dependence makes the country susceptible to global price changes and supply chain disruptions. Import reliance weakens domestic food production and discourages local farmers from expanding their operations.

Land Use and UrbanizationRapid urbanization and infrastructure projects have encroached on fertile farmland. As cities expand, agricultural lands shrink, reducing the available space for food production and increasing food scarcity in certain regions.

Economic Disparities and Access to FoodWhile food may be available in markets, it is often unaffordable for many low-income families. The rising cost of living, stagnant wages, and inflation contribute to food insecurity, forcing many Filipinos to rely on less nutritious but cheaper alternatives.

Strategies to Improve Food Security

Invest in Agricultural InnovationModernizing agriculture through sustainable practices, improved irrigation, and access to technology can increase productivity. Providing farmers with better seeds, fertilizers, and machinery will help boost food production.

Strengthen Local Food ProductionReducing reliance on imports by promoting local farming and agribusiness initiatives can enhance food security. Incentivizing smallholder farmers through subsidies, loans, and training programs can encourage more sustainable agricultural growth.

Enhance Disaster Preparedness and Climate ResilienceImplementing climate-smart agriculture, building resilient infrastructure, and developing early warning systems can help mitigate the effects of climate change on food production.

Promote Sustainable Land Use PoliciesBalancing urban development with agricultural preservation is crucial. Implementing zoning regulations that protect farmlands and encourage urban farming initiatives can contribute to food sustainability.

Improve Access to Nutritious FoodExpanding social welfare programs, food subsidies, and school feeding initiatives can ensure that vulnerable populations receive adequate nutrition. Encouraging community gardens and local food cooperatives can also enhance food availability at the grassroots level.

Conclusion

Food security is a fundamental issue that requires urgent and sustained action. While the Philippines faces significant challenges, strategic investments in agriculture, climate resilience, and economic policies can help build a more secure and self-sufficient food system. A future where every Filipino has access to nutritious and affordable food is not just an ideal—it is a necessity for national development and stability.

134,GPT4o-mini,"The rapid advancement of technology has transformed societies worldwide, improving communication, education, and economic growth. In the Philippines, technology plays a crucial role in daily life, from enabling remote work to enhancing digital banking and e-commerce. However, despite these advancements, a significant portion of the population still faces barriers to accessing technology.

The Digital Divide in the Philippines

While major cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao boast high-speed internet and widespread smartphone usage, many rural areas lag behind due to poor infrastructure and high costs. The disparity in digital access creates a gap between those who can take advantage of technology and those who are left behind, reinforcing socio-economic inequalities.

A key indicator of this divide is internet accessibility. The Philippines has one of the most expensive yet slowest internet connections in Southeast Asia. High costs and unreliable service make it difficult for students, small business owners, and remote workers in underserved areas to fully participate in the digital economy.

Barriers to Technology Access

Limited Infrastructure DevelopmentMany remote and rural areas suffer from poor telecommunications infrastructure, making it difficult to provide stable internet and mobile connectivity. The lack of cell towers and fiber-optic networks hinders digital inclusion.

High Cost of Devices and Internet ServicesSmartphones, laptops, and internet plans remain unaffordable for many low-income families. Without subsidies or budget-friendly options, a large segment of the population is unable to afford essential digital tools.

Digital Literacy and Education GapsMany Filipinos, particularly older individuals and those in underprivileged communities, lack digital literacy skills. Without proper training in using technology effectively, access alone is not enough to bridge the digital divide.

Urban-Rural DisparitiesThe concentration of technology investments in urban centers leaves rural communities struggling to keep up. This affects local businesses, schools, and government services that rely on digital solutions for efficiency.

Cybersecurity and Privacy ConcernsWith increased digital activity comes the risk of cyber threats. Many Filipinos are unaware of online safety measures, making them vulnerable to scams, data breaches, and misinformation.

The Role of the Government and Private Sector

To address these challenges, both the government and private sector must work together to implement solutions that promote equitable technology access. Some key steps include:

Expanding Infrastructure InvestmentsThe government must push for nationwide broadband expansion projects, particularly in remote areas. Encouraging public-private partnerships can accelerate connectivity improvements.

Affordable Internet and Device ProgramsSubsidizing internet costs for low-income families and promoting local manufacturing of affordable digital devices can help lower barriers to entry.

Enhancing Digital Literacy ProgramsSchools, NGOs, and private firms should collaborate to provide digital skills training, ensuring that more Filipinos can safely and effectively navigate online spaces.

Promoting E-Government and Online ServicesStreamlining government services through digital platforms can make public transactions more efficient while encouraging wider adoption of technology in daily life.

Strengthening Cybersecurity MeasuresRaising awareness about digital safety, enforcing stricter online security policies, and providing resources to combat cybercrimes will protect users from potential threats.

135,GPT4o-mini,"The youth of the Philippines have always played a crucial role in shaping the nation’s political landscape. As the country’s largest demographic group, young Filipinos have the numbers, the voice, and the influence to drive significant change. With advancements in technology, increased access to information, and a growing sense of civic responsibility, today’s youth are more engaged than ever in political discourse and activism.

The Growing Political Awareness Among Youth

The rise of social media has given young Filipinos an unprecedented platform to express their political views, organize movements, and hold leaders accountable. Unlike previous generations, today's youth are more informed and critical of policies that affect their future. This awareness has led to increased voter participation, advocacy for social justice, and a push for transparency and good governance.

The 2022 national elections saw a historic surge in youth voter turnout, demonstrating their collective power in influencing political outcomes. Youth-led organizations, campus debates, and digital campaigns played a significant role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing voters.

Challenges Facing Youth Participation in Politics

Despite their growing influence, young Filipinos face several challenges in their quest to shape Philippine politics:

Political DisenfranchisementMany young Filipinos still feel disconnected from the political system, believing that their voices do not matter. Traditional political structures often exclude youth participation, making it difficult for them to have a direct impact on decision-making.

Misinformation and Political ManipulationThe spread of fake news and propaganda on social media has made it challenging for young voters to distinguish fact from fiction. Political groups often exploit digital platforms to sway public opinion, sometimes leading to polarization and misinformation.

Economic Barriers to Political EngagementMany young Filipinos, especially those from marginalized communities, struggle with economic hardships that limit their ability to engage in political activities. For some, survival takes precedence over civic engagement, reducing opportunities for political participation.

Limited Representation in LeadershipWhile youth are active in advocacy and grassroots movements, their representation in formal political institutions remains low. Traditional political dynasties and established elites continue to dominate leadership positions, making it difficult for young leaders to rise through the ranks.

How Youth Can Shape Philippine Politics

Maximizing the Power of the VoteVoting is one of the most direct ways for young Filipinos to influence governance. Encouraging voter registration, political education, and participation in elections ensures that youth voices are represented in policymaking.

136,GPT4o-mini,"The debate over federalism in the Philippines has been ongoing for decades, gaining momentum in recent years as various political leaders advocate for a shift from a unitary to a federal system of government. Proponents argue that federalism would bring governance closer to the people, allowing regions more autonomy and control over their resources. However, critics warn of the risks, including increased regional disparities, political dynasties, and potential instability. As the nation continues to grapple with this contentious issue, it is essential to examine the potential benefits, risks, and viability of federalism in the Philippine context.

Understanding Federalism

Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and regional governments. In a federal setup, local governments have more control over their economic policies, infrastructure projects, and governance, rather than relying heavily on directives from the national government.

Currently, the Philippines operates under a unitary system, where most powers and resources are centralized in the national government based in Manila. Shifting to a federal system would mean granting greater autonomy to regions, allowing them to have their own policies on taxation, law enforcement, and governance.

Arguments in Favor of Federalism

Decentralization and Regional EmpowermentOne of the strongest arguments for federalism is that it would reduce the overconcentration of power in Manila and distribute authority to regional governments. This would allow local leaders to craft policies tailored to the needs of their specific communities.

Economic DevelopmentProponents believe that federalism would lead to more balanced economic growth, as regions would have more control over their revenues. Instead of waiting for allocations from the national budget, regions could manage their own resources and invest in local development projects.

Improved Public ServicesWith regional governments having greater control over budgets and decision-making, public services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure could be better managed and tailored to local needs.

Reduced Bureaucracy and Faster Decision-MakingUnder a federal system, governance would be more localized, reducing the bureaucratic red tape that often slows down development projects and public service delivery in a centralized system.

Concerns and Challenges of Federalism

Risk of Widening Economic DisparitiesSome regions in the Philippines, such as Metro Manila and Cebu, are more economically developed than others. Critics argue that poorer regions might struggle without sufficient national support, further widening economic disparities.

Political Dynasties and CorruptionDecentralization could empower political dynasties that already dominate local politics, making it harder to implement transparency and good governance. With more resources and autonomy, some fear that federalism could lead to increased corruption at the regional level.

Complexity and Cost of TransitionShifting from a unitary to a federal system would require constitutional amendments, restructuring of government institutions, and the creation of new regional governments. This transition could be costly and disruptive.

National Unity and StabilitySome critics worry that giving too much autonomy to regions could foster separatist movements, particularly in areas with strong ethnic or cultural identities. Ensuring national unity while granting regional autonomy is a delicate balance that must be carefully managed.

Viability of Federalism in the Philippines

For federalism to work in the Philippines, comprehensive planning and safeguards must be in place. Key factors to consider include:

Equalization mechanisms to ensure that less-developed regions receive adequate funding and support.

Strict anti-corruption policies to prevent local leaders from misusing newfound autonomy.

Clear delineation of powers between the national and regional governments to avoid conflicts.

Gradual implementation to allow a smooth transition and adaptation to the new system.

Conclusion

The idea of federalism presents both opportunities and challenges for the Philippines. While decentralization could empower regions and promote economic growth, it also carries risks that must not be overlooked. A well-structured federal system with strong institutions and safeguards could benefit the country, but hasty implementation without addressing key concerns could lead to further political and economic instability.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt federalism should be guided by thorough studies, expert consultations, and the voices of the Filipino people. It is a bold step that requires careful planning, ensuring that the shift would serve the greater good rather than merely redistributing power among the political elite.",1

Election campaigns in the Philippines require substantial funding. Candidates spend millions on advertisements, rallies, transportation, and other logistical needs. While the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) mandates campaign finance reports, many candidates and parties fail to fully disclose their expenses and funding sources, leading to widespread speculation about illicit contributions.

One of the biggest concerns is the role of business interests and political dynasties in campaign financing. Wealthy individuals and corporations often fund political campaigns in exchange for policy favors once a candidate wins office. This practice perpetuates a cycle where the interests of the elite overshadow the needs of ordinary citizens.

Challenges in Ensuring Financial Transparency

Lack of Proper EnforcementWhile campaign finance laws exist, their implementation remains weak. COMELEC lacks the necessary resources to thoroughly audit campaign finance reports and penalize violations effectively. Many candidates circumvent regulations by underreporting expenses or funneling funds through third parties.

Opaque Donation SourcesPolitical contributions from businesses, foreign entities, and interest groups are often hidden through intermediaries. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the undue influence of donors on government policies and decision-making.

Vote-Buying and Patronage PoliticsVote-buying remains rampant in many parts of the country. Candidates allocate large portions of their campaign funds to direct cash handouts, gifts, or incentives in exchange for votes. This undermines the democratic process and skews election results in favor of those with deeper pockets.

Unregulated Online Campaign SpendingWith the rise of digital campaigns, candidates increasingly rely on social media advertising and online influence operations. The lack of clear regulations on digital campaign spending makes it difficult to track where the money comes from and how it is used.

Strategies to Improve Election Campaign Financial Transparency

Strengthening Campaign Finance LawsStricter legislation should be passed to close loopholes that allow for unregulated campaign donations and expenditures. Laws should require detailed disclosure of all contributions and expenditures, with penalties for non-compliance.

Enhancing COMELEC’s Oversight and CapacityCOMELEC should be given more resources and authority to monitor and audit campaign finances. Establishing an independent auditing body dedicated to election finance oversight can further ensure compliance.

Implementing Real-Time Disclosure of Campaign FundsCandidates and parties should be required to disclose campaign donations and expenditures in real time through a publicly accessible online platform. This will allow voters to assess financial influences in elections more transparently.

Regulating Online Campaign SpendingThe government should implement policies that require political ads on social media to disclose their funding sources. Social media platforms should also be mandated to maintain transparency reports on political advertisements.

Cracking Down on Vote-BuyingStronger measures, including stricter penalties and community education campaigns, should be implemented to combat vote-buying. Citizens should be encouraged to report cases of vote-buying through anonymous tip lines and secure reporting platforms.

Conclusion

Ensuring financial transparency in election campaigns is essential for protecting the integrity of the Philippine democratic process. Without proper regulations and enforcement, elections risk being dominated by moneyed interests rather than the genuine will of the people. By strengthening campaign finance laws, empowering oversight bodies, and leveraging technology for transparency, the Philippines can take meaningful steps toward a more accountable and democratic electoral system.",1
138,GPT4o-mini,"Mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, yet in the Philippines, it remains a largely misunderstood and stigmatized issue. Despite increasing awareness, deep-rooted cultural beliefs, limited mental health services, and social misconceptions continue to prevent many Filipinos from seeking help. Addressing mental health stigma is crucial in fostering a society that supports individuals struggling with mental illnesses and promotes mental well-being for all.

The Reality of Mental Health Stigma in the Philippines

Mental health conditions affect millions of Filipinos, yet discussing these issues is often met with skepticism or dismissal. Many people still associate mental illnesses with weakness, laziness, or even spiritual affliction. As a result, individuals experiencing depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia often suffer in silence, fearing discrimination from their families, workplaces, and communities.

While legislative progress has been made—such as the passage of the Mental Health Act in 2018—many barriers to mental healthcare remain. Limited access to professional help, financial constraints, and a shortage of mental health professionals contribute to the ongoing crisis.

Factors Contributing to Mental Health Stigma

Cultural and Religious BeliefsIn Filipino culture, resilience and strong family ties are highly valued. Mental illness is often perceived as a sign of weakness, and individuals struggling with mental health issues may be told to simply “pray harder” or “snap out of it.” While faith and spirituality can be sources of comfort, they should not replace professional intervention when needed.

Lack of Awareness and EducationMisinformation about mental health conditions is widespread. Many Filipinos still believe that mental illness is a result of supernatural forces or personal failure. Without proper education, misconceptions continue to thrive, reinforcing negative stereotypes.

Fear of Social JudgmentThose who openly discuss their struggles with mental health often face discrimination. In the workplace, employees fear being labeled as unstable or incapable, potentially risking their careers. In families, individuals may be dismissed or ridiculed instead of being given the support they need.

Limited Access to Mental Health ServicesWhile the Mental Health Act aims to improve accessibility to mental healthcare, services remain insufficient, especially in rural areas. Many public hospitals lack the necessary resources, and private therapy is often too expensive for the average Filipino.

Media Representation and StereotypesPopular culture often portrays individuals with mental illness as violent or dangerous, reinforcing negative biases. Films, television shows, and news reports sometimes sensationalize mental health crises rather than promote understanding and empathy.

The Consequences of Stigma

The stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines has severe consequences. Individuals who fear judgment often avoid seeking treatment, leading to worsening conditions. This can result in higher rates of self-harm and suicide, particularly among young people who feel isolated and unsupported.

Furthermore, untreated mental health issues can affect productivity, relationships, and overall quality of life. When individuals do not receive proper care, the burden extends to families, workplaces, and communities, creating a ripple effect that impacts society as a whole.

Steps Toward Breaking the Stigma

Promoting Mental Health EducationSchools, workplaces, and community organizations should incorporate mental health education to debunk myths and encourage open conversations. Teaching young people about emotional well-being can help normalize discussions about mental health from an early age.

Expanding Access to Mental Health ServicesThe government must continue investing in mental health infrastructure, including hiring more professionals, improving facilities, and making services more affordable. Teletherapy and digital mental health platforms can also help bridge the gap for those in remote areas.

Encouraging Supportive ConversationsFamilies and friends play a crucial role in supporting individuals struggling with mental health. By fostering a culture of understanding and empathy, loved ones can create safe spaces where people feel comfortable seeking help.

Strengthening Workplace Mental Health PoliciesCompanies should implement mental health programs that provide employees with resources, support systems, and accommodations when needed. Recognizing mental health as part of overall employee well-being can lead to a more productive and compassionate work environment.

Using Media as a Tool for ChangeResponsible storytelling in television, film, and news can help change public perception. By portraying mental health struggles with accuracy and sensitivity, the media can play a significant role in breaking down stereotypes.

Conclusion

The stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines remains a significant barrier to progress, but change is possible through collective effort. By fostering education, improving healthcare access, and normalizing conversations about mental well-being, Filipinos can move toward a society where seeking help is not a sign of weakness but a step toward healing.

Breaking the stigma requires both institutional reforms and cultural shifts. It is time to prioritize mental health as an integral part of national development and individual well-being. After all, a mentally healthy nation is a stronger, more resilient one.

139,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is facing a growing crisis in urban congestion and housing shortages. As cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao continue to expand, the influx of people searching for better economic opportunities has placed immense pressure on urban infrastructure, transportation, and housing availability. This rapid urbanization has led to overcrowding, traffic gridlock, and an increasing number of informal settlements. Without decisive action, these issues will continue to hinder economic growth and the quality of life for millions of Filipinos.

The Reality of Urban Congestion

Metro Manila, the country’s capital region, is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. With over 13 million residents crammed into a limited space, daily life is characterized by hours-long traffic jams, overburdened public transportation, and high pollution levels. The economic cost of congestion is staggering, with estimates suggesting that the country loses billions of pesos annually due to lost productivity and increased fuel consumption.

Public transport systems, including jeepneys, buses, and trains, struggle to accommodate the daily commuter influx. While efforts have been made to expand infrastructure, such as the MRT and LRT extensions, these projects have yet to significantly alleviate congestion. Limited road networks and the prioritization of private vehicles over mass transit have further compounded the problem.

Housing Shortages and Informal Settlements

The housing shortage in the Philippines is another pressing issue linked to urban congestion. The backlog of housing units has been estimated at over 6 million, with demand increasing yearly. Many low-income families cannot afford decent housing, leading to the proliferation of informal settlements, or ""squatter areas,"" in cities. These communities lack access to clean water, sanitation, and electricity, exacerbating poverty and public health risks.

Skyrocketing property prices also contribute to the problem. Real estate in prime urban areas remains unaffordable for the average worker, forcing many to live in overcrowded rental spaces or commute from distant provinces, adding to the congestion problem. Meanwhile, government housing programs have struggled to keep up with demand, often falling short in providing sustainable, affordable housing solutions.

Causes of the Crisis

Uncontrolled Urban MigrationRural-to-urban migration continues to drive population growth in major cities. Limited economic opportunities in the provinces push many Filipinos to relocate, exacerbating housing and transport issues.

Lack of Comprehensive Urban PlanningPoor urban planning and inconsistent zoning regulations have contributed to chaotic city layouts, inefficient land use, and a lack of sustainable infrastructure.

High Land and Housing CostsReal estate developers often prioritize high-end condominiums and commercial buildings, making affordable housing a low priority. Government policies on land use and housing development need urgent reforms to address this imbalance.

Inadequate Public Transport SystemsThe focus on road expansions instead of efficient mass transit solutions has led to car-dependent urban centers, worsening congestion and pollution.

Weak Implementation of Housing ProgramsWhile the government has initiated housing projects, delays, corruption, and lack of funding have hampered their effectiveness. Many projects fail to reach those who need them the most.

Possible Solutions

Invest in Mass Transit and Smart Urban PlanningExpanding and modernizing public transportation, such as metro rail systems, bus rapid transit, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, can help decongest cities. Implementing smart city planning and decentralizing economic hubs can also encourage balanced regional development.

Affordable Housing DevelopmentThe government should incentivize developers to build low-cost housing through subsidies and tax incentives. Mixed-income housing projects can help integrate different social classes and promote inclusive urban growth.

Decentralization of Economic CentersEncouraging business growth in secondary cities and provinces can reduce migration pressure on Metro Manila. Improving rural infrastructure, such as roads and internet connectivity, can help create jobs outside major urban areas.

Strengthening Housing Policies and RegulationsImplementing stricter zoning laws and enforcing policies that prevent speculative real estate pricing can help stabilize housing costs. Land reform and efficient titling processes can also increase housing supply.

Sustainable and Inclusive Community DevelopmentSlum upgrading programs, community-led housing initiatives, and improved access to basic services can help integrate informal settlers into the formal housing market. Public-private partnerships can also be leveraged for more innovative housing solutions.

Conclusion

Urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines require urgent and coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and civil society. Sustainable urban planning, mass transit expansion, and affordable housing development are critical to making cities more livable and inclusive. The future of the Philippines depends on proactive policies that balance economic growth with social equity, ensuring that every Filipino has access to decent housing and a better quality of life.",1
140,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines, an archipelagic nation known for its stunning beaches and rich marine biodiversity, is facing a crisis that threatens its environment, public health, and economic well-being: plastic pollution. As one of the world's top contributors to ocean plastic waste, the country is grappling with an overwhelming volume of discarded plastic that clogs waterways, suffocates marine life, and infiltrates the food chain. Despite various efforts to curb this issue, plastic pollution remains a persistent and growing problem. It is time for immediate, collective action to address the root causes of this crisis before irreparable damage is done.

The Magnitude of the Problem

According to a 2021 study by the environmental advocacy group Ocean Conservancy, the Philippines contributes approximately 36% of the world’s plastic waste that enters the ocean. This staggering figure is largely attributed to the country's inefficient waste management system, high plastic consumption, and a reliance on single-use plastics. With over 7,000 islands and an extensive coastline, the Philippines is particularly vulnerable to the consequences of marine plastic pollution.

One major culprit is the sachet culture, wherein small, single-use plastic packaging is widely used for household products such as shampoo, coffee, and condiments. These sachets, often marketed as affordable options for low-income consumers, are nearly impossible to recycle, resulting in massive waste accumulation. Additionally, inadequate waste disposal infrastructure, especially in urban areas, has led to garbage piling up in waterways, further exacerbating the pollution problem.

Environmental and Societal Consequences

The impact of plastic pollution on the Philippines' environment is catastrophic. Marine biodiversity suffers greatly, as marine animals mistakenly ingest plastic debris, leading to starvation, poisoning, and death. Coral reefs, which are vital ecosystems for fish and marine organisms, are also smothered by plastic waste, hindering their growth and ability to support marine life.

Beyond environmental degradation, plastic pollution affects human communities in profound ways. Coastal towns and fishing villages bear the brunt of the crisis, as plastic-ridden waters drive away fish populations, threatening the livelihoods of millions who depend on fishing as a primary source of income. Furthermore, plastic waste contributes to flooding in urban centers like Metro Manila, where clogged drainage systems exacerbate typhoon-related disasters. This results in significant economic losses, displacement, and health risks from waterborne diseases.

Microplastics, tiny plastic particles that result from the breakdown of larger plastic debris, have infiltrated the food chain. Studies have shown that seafood, salt, and even drinking water contain microplastics, raising concerns about long-term health implications, including hormone disruption and potential carcinogenic effects.

Government and Industry Response

Recognizing the urgency of the problem, the Philippine government has taken steps to mitigate plastic pollution. In March 2022, the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Act was signed into law, requiring large enterprises to take responsibility for the plastic waste they produce. The law mandates these corporations to establish recovery and recycling programs, reducing their overall plastic footprint.

Local governments have also implemented ordinances banning or limiting single-use plastics. Cities like Quezon City and San Fernando, Pampanga, have introduced policies to curb plastic bag usage, promote reusable alternatives, and encourage waste segregation. However, enforcement remains inconsistent, and many communities still struggle with improper waste disposal due to limited resources and infrastructure.

On the industry side, some businesses have pledged to reduce their plastic use, with initiatives such as biodegradable packaging, refilling stations, and reusable container programs gaining traction. Fast-moving consumer goods companies, which have long relied on sachet packaging, are being pressured by environmental groups and consumers to transition toward sustainable alternatives.

The Role of Communities and Individuals

While government policies and corporate responsibility are crucial, individual actions and community initiatives also play a vital role in tackling plastic pollution. Grassroots movements, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local advocates have been instrumental in cleanup drives, educational campaigns, and sustainable waste management programs.

Organizations like the Plastic-Free Philippines Movement and Save Philippine Seas work tirelessly to promote plastic alternatives and hold companies accountable for their waste. Community-led programs, such as eco-brick projects—where plastic waste is repurposed into construction materials—offer innovative solutions for reducing waste and repurposing discarded plastic.

Consumers can also contribute by making conscious choices: using reusable bags, bottles, and containers, supporting brands with sustainable practices, and actively participating in local recycling programs. Public awareness and behavioral change are essential in shifting away from a disposable culture toward a more environmentally responsible society.

A Call to Action

Plastic pollution in the Philippines is not an insurmountable problem, but it requires a unified effort from the government, industries, communities, and individuals to implement lasting solutions. Strengthening waste management infrastructure, enforcing stricter regulations on plastic production and disposal, and investing in sustainable packaging alternatives must be prioritized.

Moreover, corporate accountability should go beyond compliance with laws—companies must actively innovate and transition to eco-friendly materials. The government must also support policies that incentivize businesses and consumers to adopt sustainable practices. Education and community engagement will remain critical in fostering a culture that values environmental responsibility over convenience.

As the Philippines faces mounting challenges from climate change and environmental degradation, addressing plastic pollution should be at the forefront of national priorities. Protecting the country’s natural beauty and biodiversity is not just an ecological concern—it is a socioeconomic imperative. The time to act is now, before the plastic tide overwhelms the nation’s shores and future generations inherit an ocean of waste instead of a thriving marine paradise.",1
141,Llama3.2,"As one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, the Philippines has been touted as a beacon of hope for economic development and prosperity. However, beneath its impressive GDP growth rate lies a stark reality that has left millions of Filipinos struggling to make ends meet. The country's income inequality crisis is a ticking time bomb, threatening to destabilize social cohesion and undermine the very foundations of democracy.

The numbers are alarming. According to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country's Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, has been steadily increasing over the past two decades. In 2020, it reached a staggering 40.3, ranking the Philippines alongside South Africa and Brazil as one of the most unequal countries in the world. This means that nearly half of the population lives below the poverty line, with many more struggling to survive on meager incomes.

The effects of income inequality are far-reaching and devastating. Families are torn apart as parents sacrifice their own well-being for the sake of their children, who often drop out of school or enter the workforce at an early age to support their families. Communities are fragmented, with the rich and powerful wielding disproportionate influence over local politics and development projects.

The root causes of income inequality in the Philippines are complex and multifaceted. One major factor is the country's labor market, which has been driven by a series of neoliberal reforms that prioritize foreign investment and economic growth over social welfare and job security. The resulting ""gig economy"" has created an army of precarious workers who are denied basic rights and protections.

Another significant contributor to income inequality is the Philippines' skewed distribution of wealth. According to a report by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the country's wealthiest 10% hold over 30% of its total wealth, while the bottom 40% have less than 1%. This concentration of wealth has been fueled by decades of crony capitalism and corruption, which has allowed a small elite to accumulate vast fortunes at the expense of the majority.

The government's response to income inequality has been woefully inadequate. While President Rodrigo Duterte has made some token gestures towards social welfare and poverty reduction, his administration's focus on economic growth and infrastructure development has largely ignored the needs of the most vulnerable segments of society.

In recent years, there have been calls for a more radical approach to addressing income inequality in the Philippines. Some advocates have proposed a wealth tax or inheritance tax to redistribute wealth and fund social programs. Others have suggested implementing a universal basic income (UBI) to ensure that every citizen has access to a minimum standard of living.

However, such proposals are often met with fierce resistance from politicians and business leaders who see them as threats to economic growth and stability. The Philippines is a major recipient of foreign investment, and its government has been reluctant to implement policies that might alienate potential investors or stifle economic development.

As the global conversation around income inequality continues to grow, it is clear that the Philippines cannot afford to ignore this crisis any longer. The country needs a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of poverty and inequality, while also promoting inclusive growth and social welfare. This requires a fundamental transformation of its economic policies and institutions, as well as a renewed commitment to social justice and human rights.

One potential solution is the implementation of progressive taxation, which would shift the burden of taxation from the poor and middle class to the wealthy elite. Another approach could be to increase access to education and job training programs, which would enable more Filipinos to acquire skills and secure better-paying jobs.

Ultimately, addressing income inequality in the Philippines will require a sustained effort from government, civil society, and the private sector. It demands a willingness to challenge entrenched interests and power structures, while also promoting greater economic inclusivity and social cohesion.

As we look to the future, it is clear that the Philippines cannot afford to ignore its income inequality crisis any longer. The country has a unique opportunity to learn from other nations and pioneer new models of inclusive growth and poverty reduction. By working together, we can build a more just and equitable society for all Filipinos – where everyone has access to opportunities and resources to thrive.

142,Llama3.2,"As one of the world's top remittance-receiving countries, the Philippines has long been synonymous with the sacrifices made by its Overseas Foreign Workers (OFWs). These dedicated individuals have been the backbone of our economy for decades, sending home billions of pesos every year to support their families and loved ones back home. However, despite their immense contributions, OFWs continue to face unimaginable hardships and exploitation.

The Philippine government has often touted OFWs as a symbol of national pride, highlighting their dedication and resilience in the face of adversity. And while it is true that many OFWs embody these traits, it is equally important to acknowledge the numerous challenges they face on the job and back home.

One of the most significant issues affecting OFWs is the lack of adequate protection and support from their employers. Many OFWs are forced to work in hazardous conditions, with minimal benefits and no social security. They are often subjected to physical and emotional abuse, as well as exploitation by unscrupulous employers who take advantage of their vulnerability.

The Philippine government has implemented various measures to address these concerns, including the passage of the Migrant Workers Act of 2004 and the establishment of the Department of Labor and Employment's (DOLE) Migrant Workers Division. However, despite these efforts, many OFWs continue to suffer from poor working conditions and inadequate compensation.

Another critical issue affecting OFWs is the lack of access to quality healthcare and social services back home. Many OFWs face long waiting periods for medical treatment, and those who fall ill often have to rely on their families or charitable organizations for support.

The economic impact of OFWs cannot be overstated. According to a report by the World Bank, remittances from OFWs account for approximately 10% of the country's GDP, making them a crucial component of our economy. In fact, remittances have been instrumental in mitigating poverty and reducing income inequality in the Philippines.

However, despite their significance, OFWs often receive little to no credit for their contributions to the Philippine economy. Their sacrifices are frequently overlooked, and their earnings are often seen as mere pocket change by those who reap the benefits of their labor.

This oversight is particularly galling given the historical injustices faced by Filipino migrants abroad. For generations, Filipinos have been forced to seek employment in foreign lands, often under exploitative conditions. The United States, Japan, and other major economies have long exploited Filipino migrant laborers, denying them basic rights and protections.

In recent years, however, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of OFWs to our economy and society. The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives aimed at improving working conditions and providing support services for OFWs, including the establishment of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).

The private sector has also begun to take notice of the critical role OFWs play in our economy. Many companies have started to recognize the value of their migrant workers and are implementing measures to improve working conditions and provide better compensation.

As we look to the future, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being and rights of our OFWs. This requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of exploitation and neglect. It also demands greater recognition and appreciation for the sacrifices made by these dedicated individuals.

One potential solution is the implementation of stricter regulations on employers of migrant workers, including mandatory health checks and regular inspections to ensure compliance with labor laws. Another approach could be to increase access to quality healthcare and social services back home, particularly in rural areas where OFWs often reside.

Ultimately, addressing the plight of our OFWs requires a fundamental shift in how we view their contributions to our economy and society. We must recognize that these individuals are not just workers or sources of remittances; they are also human beings deserving of dignity, respect, and protection.

As the Philippines continues to grow and develop as an economy, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being and rights of our OFWs. By doing so, we can create a more just and equitable society where all individuals, regardless of their nationality or employment status, are treated with dignity and respect.

143,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, boasting some of the world's most fertile soil and diverse ecosystems. However, despite its natural endowments, the country is facing a growing crisis that threatens the very foundation of our national identity: food security.

Food security, defined as access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food at all times, is a fundamental human right. Yet, for millions of Filipinos, this right remains an unattainable dream. The Philippines ranks among the world's most food-insecure countries, with over 40% of the population relying on non-food cash income or other means to purchase basic necessities.

The root causes of our food insecurity are multifaceted and complex. Climate change is a major contributor, as rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters have led to reduced crop yields, decreased agricultural productivity, and disrupted food systems. The country's dependence on imported rice, for example, has become unsustainable due to the increasing costs associated with transportation, storage, and logistics.

Another significant factor is the Philippines' vulnerability to external shocks in the global market. Trade wars, price volatility, and supply chain disruptions have all taken a toll on our agricultural sector, making it difficult for farmers to maintain profitability and invest in sustainable practices.

Domestically, our food security situation is further complicated by inadequate policies and lack of investment in agriculture. The Philippine government's priorities have historically been skewed towards economic growth and infrastructure development, leaving the country's agricultural sector to fend for itself.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to address these challenges and prioritize food security as a national priority. The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting agricultural development, improving access to markets, and increasing support for small-scale farmers.

One notable example is the country's National Food Security Program (NFSP), launched in 2013 with the aim of increasing rice production and reducing import dependence. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done.

Another critical area is the need for climate-resilient agriculture. The Philippines is vulnerable to various types of natural hazards, including typhoons, droughts, and floods, which can have devastating impacts on agricultural productivity. Climate-smart agriculture practices, such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture, offer promising solutions that can help farmers adapt to these challenges.

However, despite these efforts, the Philippines still faces significant hurdles in achieving food security. One major challenge is the lack of access to basic services for small-scale farmers, including credit, extension services, and market information.

Moreover, our country's agricultural sector remains heavily reliant on monoculture farming practices, which can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices, such as permaculture and agroecology, is essential for building resilience in the face of climate change.

The solution to our food security crisis lies not just in policy or technology, but also in behavioral change. We need a cultural shift that prioritizes food sovereignty, recognizes the value of traditional farming practices, and promotes sustainable consumption patterns.

In conclusion, the Philippines' struggle for food security is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and collective action. By addressing our dependence on imported rice, investing in climate-resilient agriculture, and promoting sustainable food systems, we can build a more resilient and equitable food future for all Filipinos.

As we look to the future, it is essential that we engage in an open and inclusive dialogue with stakeholders across sectors – policymakers, farmers, researchers, and consumers. Together, we must chart a course that balances economic growth with social justice and environmental sustainability.

The Philippines' food security crisis is not just about meeting our basic needs; it's about preserving the country's rich cultural heritage and protecting its natural resources for future generations. By working together, we can create a more food-secure and sustainable future – one where every Filipino has access to nutritious, affordable, and locally produced food.",1
144,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is one of the most digitally advanced countries in Southeast Asia, boasting a growing middle class and a vibrant tech industry. However, despite its progress, the country still lags behind in terms of access to technology, particularly for rural communities.

In today's digital age, having access to technology is no longer a luxury but a necessity. It has become a key driver of economic growth, social mobility, and overall well-being. Yet, for millions of Filipinos, especially those living in rural areas, the internet remains a distant dream.

The digital divide in the Philippines is a stark reminder of the country's unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. While urban centers like Manila and Cebu have made significant strides in adopting technology, many rural communities remain disconnected from the digital world.

One of the primary reasons for this disconnect is the lack of infrastructure. Many rural areas lack access to reliable internet connectivity, making it difficult for residents to stay connected with family, friends, and businesses.

The government has implemented various initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide, including the creation of the Department of Science and Technology's (DOST) National Broadband Plan. However, these efforts have been slow to materialize, leaving many Filipinos frustrated and disappointed.

Another significant challenge is the lack of affordable technology. Many rural communities struggle to afford basic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, making it difficult for them to access online services.

The impact of this digital divide cannot be overstated. Rural communities are missing out on essential services such as online banking, e-commerce, and healthcare. They are also being left behind in the global economy, with limited opportunities for education, employment, and social mobility.

However, there is hope. The private sector has stepped up to fill the gap, with companies like Globe Telecom and PLDT launching initiatives aimed at increasing internet penetration and affordability in rural areas.

One notable example is Globe's ""Globe at Home"" program, which provides affordable internet access to rural communities. This initiative has already made a significant impact, with thousands of households now enjoying reliable internet connectivity for the first time.

Another promising development is the growth of mobile payments and digital wallets. Initiatives such as PayMaya and GCash have made it possible for Filipinos to access financial services online, increasing convenience and reducing transaction costs.

However, more needs to be done. The government must prioritize investments in rural infrastructure, including broadband networks, to ensure that everyone has access to reliable internet connectivity.

Additionally, there is a need for greater awareness about the importance of digital literacy. Many rural Filipinos lack basic computer skills, making it difficult for them to navigate online services and take advantage of new technologies.

In conclusion, the Philippines' digital divide is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. While progress has been made, much more needs to be done to ensure that everyone has access to technology, regardless of their location or socio-economic status.

As we move forward, it is essential that we prioritize investments in rural infrastructure and digital literacy programs. We must also work with the private sector to increase affordability and accessibility of technology.

By bridging the gap between urban and rural communities, we can create a smarter nation where everyone has access to the opportunities and services they need to thrive. It's time for the Philippines to become a leader in the digital age, and it starts with making our country more accessible to all Filipinos.

145,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is at a crossroads. As the country navigates the complexities of modern politics, it is clear that the youth will play a pivotal role in shaping its destiny. With over 60% of the population under the age of 30, young Filipinos are increasingly taking center stage in Philippine politics.

For decades, the Philippines has struggled with an aging leadership. The country's politicians have often been out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of younger generations. However, with the rise of social media and increased access to information, young Filipinos are now more empowered than ever to engage with politics and demand change.

One of the key drivers of this shift is the growth of youth activism in the Philippines. Organizations such as the Youth Against Corruption (YAC) and the Kabataan Partylist have become powerful voices in Philippine politics, advocating for issues such as climate change, education, and social justice.

Young Filipinos are also increasingly using social media to express their opinions and mobilize support for their causes. The hashtag #Election2019, which trended on Twitter during the 2019 presidential election, was a testament to the power of young people's activism.

However, despite these efforts, young Filipinos still face significant barriers when it comes to participating in politics. Many are excluded from the electoral process due to lack of registration or identification documents, while others may not have access to quality education or job opportunities that would allow them to pursue careers in public service.

To address these challenges, the government must prioritize initiatives that increase youth participation in politics. This includes expanding voter registration drives, improving access to education and job training programs, and increasing awareness about civic engagement and voting.

Another key strategy is to empower young Filipinos as leaders and decision-makers within their communities. This can be achieved through mentorship programs, leadership training, and opportunities for internships and volunteer work in government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The Philippines also needs to recognize the value of youth voices in policy-making. The country's current leadership often overlooks the concerns and opinions of younger generations, instead prioritizing the interests of established politicians and business leaders.

To change this narrative, the government must create more inclusive decision-making processes that incorporate diverse perspectives and age groups. This can be achieved through the establishment of youth-focused councils or advisory boards that provide input on key policy decisions.

Finally, young Filipinos need to take ownership of their own empowerment. They must demand greater representation in politics and government, and be willing to challenge the status quo when necessary.

In conclusion, the Philippines is at a critical juncture in its development as a country. As the youth population continues to grow and become more influential, it is imperative that policymakers recognize their value and empower them to shape the country's destiny.

By prioritizing initiatives that increase youth participation in politics, empowering young Filipinos as leaders and decision-makers, recognizing their value in policy-making, and taking ownership of their own empowerment, we can create a brighter future for all Filipinos. The future of Philippine politics is in the hands of young people – let us give them the tools and support they need to succeed.

146,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is at a crossroads in its history. For decades, it has struggled to find its footing as a young and nascent nation, grappling with issues of governance, economy, and identity. One solution that has been touted as a panacea for these woes is federalism – a system of government where power is distributed among different regions or states. The concept may seem foreign to Filipinos, but it is time to consider the benefits that federalism can bring to our country.

The current system of government in the Philippines is a unitary one, where power is concentrated in the central government in Manila. This has led to a plethora of problems, including uneven development across different regions, limited local autonomy, and a lack of representation for the marginalized communities. The result is a country where some provinces are booming economically, while others are mired in poverty.

Federalism offers a solution to these problems. By dividing power among different states or regions, federalism ensures that each region has a say in how its own affairs are managed. This allows for more localized decision-making, which can lead to more effective and targeted development strategies. For instance, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) has been able to implement its own socio-economic agenda, thanks to its autonomy under the federal system.

One of the key benefits of federalism is that it promotes regional diversity and inclusivity. By recognizing and respecting the distinct identities and cultures of different regions, federalism ensures that every Filipino citizen has a voice in the country's governance. This can lead to greater national cohesion and a more inclusive society. In contrast, the current unitary system has often marginalized certain groups and regions, leading to feelings of exclusion and disenfranchisement.

Another advantage of federalism is that it promotes economic growth and development. By allowing each region to manage its own economy, federalism can lead to more efficient allocation of resources and investments. For example, the Ilocos Region has long been known for its rich agricultural land and natural resources, but its economy has often been hindered by inadequate infrastructure and limited access to markets. Federalism could enable the Ilocos to take a greater share in managing its own economic development, leading to faster growth and prosperity.

However, some critics of federalism argue that it would lead to fragmentation and instability. They point out that the country's history has been marked by conflicts between different regions, such as the Mindanao separatist movement. But these concerns are overstated. Federalism is not about dividing the country along ethnic or regional lines; rather, it is about giving each region more autonomy and agency in its own governance.

Furthermore, federalism is not a new concept in the Philippines. The country's founding fathers envisioned a federal system of government, as evident in the 1935 Constitution. However, the current constitution has been amended repeatedly to make it more unitary-friendly. It is time for us to revisit our constitutional framework and give federalism the chance to thrive.

Of course, implementing federalism would also require significant changes to our country's institutions, laws, and practices. This includes revising our electoral system, creating new regional governments, and reconfiguring our national budget. But these challenges can be overcome with careful planning and consultation.

In conclusion, federalism offers the Philippines a chance to break free from its current limitations and achieve greater prosperity and inclusivity. By embracing this system of government, we can unlock the potential of each region and create a more equitable society for all Filipinos. It is time for us to seize this opportunity and shape our country's future in a positive direction.

Some Possible Reforms to Federalism

While federalism offers many benefits, it also requires significant reforms to its implementation. Here are some possible reforms that could be considered:

Constitutional Review: The 1987 Constitution should be revised to include provisions for federalism, such as creating a new regional government framework and allocating more powers to local governments.
Regional Autonomy: Regions or states should have greater autonomy in managing their own affairs, including economic development, infrastructure, and social services.
Electoral Reforms: The electoral system should be revised to ensure that each region has an equal number of representatives in Congress and the Senate.
Budget Reallocation: A significant portion of the national budget should be allocated to regional governments to support their development programs and projects.
Regional Development Plans: Each region or state should have its own socio-economic agenda, which can be implemented through a coordinated effort between local government, private sector, and civil society.
International Examples

There are many countries that have successfully implemented federal systems of government. For instance:

United States: The US is often cited as an example of successful federalism. Its system of government has allowed for the creation of diverse regional cultures and economies.
Canada: Canada's federal-provincial system has enabled the country to promote economic growth, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability.
Germany: Germany's federal system has helped it maintain peace and stability, even in the face of a complex and divided history.
These examples demonstrate that federalism is not only feasible but also beneficial for countries seeking to build more inclusive and prosperous societies.",1
147,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is on the cusp of another highly anticipated election, one that promises to be as contentious as it is crucial. As Filipinos head to the polls, they must do so with eyes open to the very real possibility of electoral irregularities, manipulation, and outright cheating. But there's a reason why transparency in elections is essential – it's not just a matter of fairness; it's also a fundamental human right.

For decades, the Philippines has struggled with election-related issues. From vote-buying scandals to ghost candidates, our electoral system has been marred by corruption and malpractice. These problems are deeply entrenched, affecting not only the legitimacy of our democratic process but also the very fabric of our society. It's time for us to take a hard look at our election campaign financing laws and demand greater transparency.

The current system is woefully inadequate. With little oversight and lax enforcement, wealthy candidates and parties can shower their supporters with cash, influence, and favors – all under the guise of ""donations"" or ""philanthropy."" This creates an uneven playing field where those with deep pockets have a distinct advantage over their opponents. It's no wonder that our elections often resemble a game of poker, where the stakes are high, but the transparency is virtually nonexistent.

One of the most pressing concerns is the lack of disclosure requirements for campaign finance. Unlike in many other countries, there's no centralized database or public registry of all donations made during an election period. This makes it easy for candidates to hide their sources of funding and conceals the true extent of their financial muscle. How can we trust the integrity of our elections when we don't even know who's backing whom?

To address these concerns, it's essential that we establish a robust campaign finance transparency framework. Here are some proposed reforms:

Disclosure Requirements: Candidates and parties must publicly disclose all donations received during an election period. This includes specifying the donor's identity, donation amount, and purpose.
Centralized Registry: A national registry should be established to track all campaign contributions, allowing for real-time monitoring and verification of donations.
Transparency in Political Ads: To prevent fake news and propaganda, there must be stricter regulations on political advertisements, including clear labeling of sponsored content and regular audits of ad spend.
Increased Penalties for Non-Compliance: Those who fail to disclose their campaign contributions or engage in other illicit activities should face stiffer penalties, including fines and even imprisonment.
By implementing these reforms, we can significantly reduce the influence of money in our politics. When candidates are forced to be transparent about their funding sources, voters will have a better understanding of who's backing whom – and make more informed decisions as a result.

International Benchmarks

The Philippines is not alone in its struggle for campaign finance transparency. Many countries around the world have implemented robust regulations to ensure that elections remain free from corruption and undue influence. For example:

Norway: Norway has one of the most transparent election systems in the world, with strict disclosure requirements and regular audits of campaign contributions.
Germany: Germany's electoral laws require candidates to disclose their donors and expenditure amounts, helping to prevent money laundering and ensure a level playing field for all parties.
Australia: Australia's Electoral Commission has implemented innovative technologies to track donations and spending during election campaigns, providing citizens with real-time information on who's backing whom.
These countries demonstrate that campaign finance transparency is achievable and crucial for maintaining the integrity of democratic processes. It's time for us to follow suit.

A Call to Action

As Filipinos head to the polls, we have a unique opportunity to shape our country's future. We must demand greater transparency in our elections, including robust campaign finance regulations. By working together, we can create a more level playing field where every candidate has an equal chance of winning based on their policies and ideas – not just their wealth or influence.

Let us rise above the noise and corruption that often characterizes our elections. Let us choose to prioritize transparency, accountability, and fairness in our democratic process. Together, we can build a stronger, more inclusive democracy that truly represents the will of the Filipino people.

A Brighter Future

The Philippines is at a crossroads in its history. Will we continue down the path of corruption and inequality, or will we choose to forge a new course based on transparency, fairness, and accountability? The answer lies with us – the next generation of Filipinos who deserve better, smarter, and more inclusive governance.

It's time for us to take back our democracy and ensure that every vote counts. Let us march toward a brighter future where elections are fair, free, and transparent – not just for ourselves, but for generations to come.",1
148,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is a country known for its vibrant culture, stunning natural beauty, and resilient people. However, beneath the surface of this idyllic facade lies a shocking reality: mental health stigma that perpetuates suffering, isolation, and even death.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression and anxiety are among the most prevalent mental health issues worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people in the Asia-Pacific region alone. Yet, despite these alarming statistics, mental illness remains shrouded in taboo and shame in our country. The consequences of this stigma are dire: delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment, and even suicide.

The Philippines' mental health crisis is often overlooked or ignored by policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public. This lack of attention contributes to the perpetuation of stigma, as those struggling with mental illness feel forced to hide their struggles for fear of social ostracism, ridicule, or worse.

A Culture of Shame

The Philippines' cultural context plays a significant role in maintaining this stigma. Traditional values emphasize family honor, respect for elders, and the importance of social harmony. Mental illness is often seen as a reflection of personal weakness or moral failing, rather than a legitimate health condition that requires treatment and support.

This shame-based approach to mental illness has led to devastating consequences. Many individuals who struggle with mental health issues are forced to live in secrecy, hiding their symptoms from family members, friends, and even healthcare professionals. This isolation can exacerbate symptoms, making it more challenging for those seeking help to access the care they need.

The Consequences of Stigma

The effects of stigma on mental health outcomes are multifaceted:

Delayed Diagnosis: Fear of being labeled as ""crazy"" or ""weak"" prevents individuals from seeking medical attention, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.
Inadequate Treatment: Healthcare professionals may be hesitant to provide effective care due to concerns about the individual's mental state or reputation.
Social Isolation: Mental illness can lead to social withdrawal, further exacerbating feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
Suicide: The stigma surrounding mental illness increases the risk of suicidal behavior, particularly among vulnerable populations such as young people and those with a history of trauma.
Breaking the Silence

It's time for us to shatter the silence surrounding mental health issues in the Philippines. By promoting awareness, reducing stigma, and increasing access to care, we can create a society that values mental well-being and supports individuals struggling with mental illness.

Here are some steps we can take:

Public Education: Launch nationwide campaigns to raise awareness about mental health, its effects on individuals and families, and the importance of seeking help.
Mental Health Training: Provide training for healthcare professionals, educators, and community workers to recognize and respond effectively to mental health issues.
Increased Funding: Allocate more resources to mental health services, including increasing the number of counselors, therapists, and support groups available.
Legislative Reform: Enact laws that protect individuals from discrimination based on mental health status, ensuring equal access to employment, education, and social services.
A Brighter Future

The Philippines has the potential to be a global leader in mental health care. By addressing the stigma surrounding mental illness and promoting awareness, we can create a society that values the well-being of all its citizens. Together, we can break the silence and build a brighter future for ourselves and those struggling with mental health issues.

As Mahatma Gandhi once said, ""The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed."" Let us strive to create a world where everyone has access to quality mental health care, free from stigma and judgment. The time for change is now.

A Call to Action

To all Filipinos who are struggling with mental illness or know someone who is, we urge you to speak out against the silence surrounding mental health issues. Share your story, seek help, and support loved ones in their journey towards recovery. Together, we can create a society that values mental well-being and supports individuals struggling with mental illness.

149,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is on the move, rapidly urbanizing as millions of Filipinos flock to cities in search of economic opportunities and a better life. However, this rapid growth comes with a steep price – congested roads, overcrowded public spaces, and a severe shortage of affordable housing.

Urban congestion is a pressing issue in the Philippines, affecting not only the quality of life but also the economy and national security. The country's urban areas are plagued by gridlocked roads, inadequate public transportation, and extreme air pollution. This situation is further exacerbated by the lack of proper planning and zoning regulations, leading to sprawling metropolises with little thought for sustainability or environmental impact.

The housing shortage is another pressing concern in the Philippines. With a growing population and limited land availability, the demand for affordable housing far outstrips supply. Low-cost housing projects are often plagued by corruption, inadequate construction standards, and poor management practices. This has led to substandard living conditions, increased poverty rates, and a lack of social mobility.

The Human Cost

Urban congestion and housing shortages have severe consequences on human well-being:

Poor Air Quality: The Philippines' cities are notorious for their air pollution, which can lead to respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even premature death.
Increased Inequality: Urban congestion perpetuates inequality by limiting access to basic services like healthcare, education, and employment opportunities for low-income residents.
Strain on Public Services: The lack of affordable housing exacerbates the strain on public services like sanitation, water supply, and waste management.
Human Rights Abuses: Substandard living conditions in low-cost housing projects can lead to human rights abuses, including exploitation of workers and residents.
Causes and Consequences

The causes of urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines are complex:

Lack of Urban Planning: Poor planning and zoning regulations have contributed to the development of sprawling metropolises with inadequate infrastructure.
Corruption: Corruption is a significant obstacle to affordable housing, as it perpetuates the allocation of limited resources for personal gain rather than public benefit.
Limited Land Availability: The Philippines' geography and land tenure laws limit the availability of land for development, exacerbating the shortage.
Inadequate Infrastructure: Insufficient infrastructure, including roads, public transportation, and utilities, hinders economic growth and reduces the quality of life.
Solutions

Breaking the cycle of urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multifaceted approach:

Urban Planning and Zoning Regulations: Strengthening urban planning and zoning regulations can help promote sustainable development and reduce the sprawl of cities.
Affordable Housing Initiatives: Implementing affordable housing programs, such as social housing projects and rent-to-own schemes, can provide access to basic services like sanitation, water supply, and healthcare for low-income residents.
Public Transportation Upgrades: Investing in public transportation infrastructure, including buses and trains, can alleviate traffic congestion and reduce air pollution.
Innovative Financing Mechanisms: Exploring innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and green bonds, can help fund infrastructure projects and affordable housing initiatives.
A Brighter Future

The Philippines has the potential to be a model for sustainable urban development in Southeast Asia. By addressing the root causes of urban congestion and housing shortages, we can create cities that are not only livable but also economically vibrant and socially inclusive.

As the country continues to urbanize, it is essential that we prioritize planning, zoning regulations, and affordable housing initiatives to ensure a brighter future for all Filipinos.

A Call to Action

To policymakers, private sector stakeholders, and civil society organizations, we urge you to join forces in addressing the pressing issues of urban congestion and housing shortages. We need to create a comprehensive plan that prioritizes sustainable development, social equity, and human well-being.

Let us work together to build a better future for the Philippines – one that is marked by vibrant cities, affordable housing, and quality of life for all.",1
150,Llama3.2,"The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, is facing a crisis that threatens its very existence. Plastic pollution, once confined to the farthest reaches of our oceans, has now become an omnipresent menace that affects every aspect of our lives. From the pristine beaches to the polluted rivers, plastic waste has invaded every corner of our country, leaving behind a trail of destruction and chaos.

The statistics are staggering:

Over 4 million tons of plastic waste enter the Philippines' waters every year.
The country's oceans are filled with over 100 billion pieces of plastic debris, including bags, bottles, straws, and microbeads.
Plastic pollution is responsible for the death of over 100,000 marine animals annually in our country alone.
The impact of plastic pollution goes beyond the environment. It affects human health, the economy, and our way of life. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that exposure to microplastics can cause serious health problems, including cancer, reproductive issues, and respiratory diseases.

The Root Cause

So, what is driving this plastic pollution crisis? The answer lies in a complex web of factors:

Lack of waste management infrastructure: Our country's inadequate waste management systems lead to the overflowing of landfills and the disposal of trash into rivers and oceans.
Single-use plastics: The proliferation of single-use plastics, such as bags, straws, and water bottles, has created a culture of disposability that encourages waste generation.
Lack of public awareness: Many Filipinos are unaware of the impact of their actions on our environment and the consequences of plastic pollution.
Solutions

Breaking the cycle of plastic pollution requires a collective effort from individuals, communities, organizations, and government agencies. Here are some solutions:

Implement extended producer responsibility (EPR): Hold manufacturers accountable for the waste generated by their products.
Increase recycling efforts: Improve our waste management infrastructure to increase recycling rates and reduce waste disposal into landfills and oceans.
Promote sustainable consumption patterns: Encourage individuals to adopt a more mindful approach to consumption, reducing single-use plastics and opting for reusable alternatives.
Establish marine protected areas: Establish sanctuaries for marine life, protecting our oceans from plastic pollution and other threats.
A Call to Action

To every Filipino, we urge you to join the fight against plastic pollution:

Reduce your use of single-use plastics: Bring a reusable bag when shopping, refuse straws and water bottles, and choose products with minimal packaging.
Participate in beach cleanups: Join local organizations and participate in beach cleanups to raise awareness and collect trash.
Support plastic-free initiatives: Encourage businesses and government agencies to adopt plastic-free policies and practices.
A Brighter Future

The Philippines has the potential to be a leader in reducing plastic pollution. We can break the cycle of waste generation, protect our environment, and promote a healthier lifestyle for all Filipinos.

As we move forward, let us remember that every small action counts. Together, we can make a difference and create a better future for ourselves, our children, and generations to come.

151,Llama3.2,"The Elephant in the Room: Confronting the Philippines' Growing Income Inequality

As the Philippines celebrates its economic growth and progress, a pressing concern is being swept under the rug – income inequality. The country's GDP has been steadily increasing over the past decade, but behind the numbers lies a stark reality: one-third of the population lives below the poverty line, while the wealthiest 10% control over half of the nation's wealth.

Income inequality in the Philippines is not just a moral issue; it's an economic ticking time bomb. The widening gap between the rich and the poor has severe consequences on social cohesion, human development, and overall economic performance. It's time for policymakers to acknowledge this elephant in the room and take concrete steps to address this pressing issue.

The Roots of Inequality

Income inequality in the Philippines is rooted in its colonial past, when the wealthy elite controlled the means of production and exploited the labor force. The country's current economic policies have only exacerbated this problem. The neoliberal agenda that dominated the economy from the 1980s to the 2010s prioritized export-led growth over social welfare, leading to a concentration of wealth among a few.

The Philippine government's reliance on remittances from overseas workers has also contributed to inequality. While remittances are essential for the country's economy, they create an uneven playing field, where those who have left the country often bring back higher-paying jobs and investments, while those who remain are left behind.

Consequences of Inequality

The consequences of income inequality in the Philippines are far-reaching:

Poverty: The poor face significant challenges in accessing basic services like healthcare, education, and sanitation.
Social Unrest: The widening gap between the rich and the poor has led to increased social unrest, as marginalized communities demand their share of the country's wealth.
Economic Stagnation: Inequality hampers economic growth by stifling innovation, reducing consumer spending, and discouraging investment in education and human capital.
Brain Drain: The Philippines loses talented individuals to other countries due to limited job opportunities and low wages.
Policy Responses

To address income inequality, policymakers must adopt a multi-faceted approach:

Progressive Taxation: Implement a more progressive tax system that targets the wealthy and large corporations, ensuring they contribute their fair share to the country's social welfare.
Invest in Human Capital: Invest in education and training programs that equip workers with skills relevant to the modern economy, enabling them to compete for better-paying jobs.
Social Protection Programs: Expand social protection programs like conditional cash transfers, healthcare, and unemployment benefits to support vulnerable populations.
Regulatory Reforms: Strengthen labor laws and regulations to protect workers' rights, prevent exploitation, and ensure fair compensation.
Challenges Ahead

Implementing policies that address income inequality will not be easy. The Philippines faces significant challenges:

Limited Fiscal Space: With a relatively small tax base, the government struggles to fund social programs and policies.
Corruption: Corruption is rampant in the country, undermining trust in institutions and hindering effective governance.
Lack of Political Will: Policy-makers often prioritize short-term gains over long-term solutions.
Conclusion

Income inequality is a ticking time bomb that threatens the very fabric of Philippine society. To address this pressing issue, policymakers must take bold action to redistribute wealth, invest in human capital, and regulate the economy to ensure fair competition. It's time for leaders to put people over profits and prioritize social welfare above economic growth.

The Philippines has made significant progress in recent years, but it cannot afford to ignore the elephant in the room – income inequality. By acknowledging this issue and working together to address it, we can build a more inclusive, equitable, and prosperous society for all Filipinos.",1
152,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is one of the largest remittance-receiving countries in the world, with Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) playing a vital role in keeping the economy afloat. Every year, millions of Filipinos leave their homeland to work abroad, sending billions of dollars back home to support their families and communities. But the OFW phenomenon is more than just a numbers game; it's a reflection of our economic reality, social fabric, and national identity.

The Rise of OFWs

In the 1980s, remittances from Filipino workers overseas started to gain attention as a significant contributor to the country's economy. The Philippine Statistics Authority reported that in 2019, remittances reached PHP 338 billion (approximately USD 6.5 billion), accounting for about 10% of the country's GDP. Today, remittances are considered one of the country's main foreign exchange earners.

The number of OFWs has grown exponentially over the years, with estimates suggesting that there are around 10 million Filipinos working overseas. The majority of these workers are migrant domestic workers, followed by those in industries such as manufacturing, construction, and healthcare. Many are also entrepreneurs or small business owners, contributing to the country's entrepreneurial spirit.

The Economic Impact

OFWs have a profound impact on the Philippines' economy:

Foreign Exchange Earnings: Remittances provide a vital source of foreign exchange earnings, helping to stabilize the currency and support imports.
Job Creation: OFWs create jobs for thousands of family members in industries such as agriculture, small-scale enterprises, and services.
Social Protection: Remittances help fund social programs, including poverty alleviation initiatives, education, and healthcare.
However, the OFW phenomenon is not without its challenges:

Brain Drain: The loss of skilled workers to other countries hampers the country's ability to innovate and develop new industries.
Exploitation: Many OFWs face exploitation and abuse while abroad, including poor working conditions, low wages, and limited access to social services.
Remittance Dependence: The country's economy is heavily reliant on remittances from abroad, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy.
Policy Responses

To address these challenges, policymakers must take a multi-faceted approach:

Promote Sustainable Migration: Encourage sustainable migration practices that prioritize workers' welfare and rights.
Enhance Remittance Services: Develop more efficient remittance systems to reduce transaction costs and increase access to financial services for OFWs.
Invest in Human Capital: Invest in education, training, and skills development programs to equip Filipinos with the skills needed to compete in the global market.
Social and Cultural Significance

The OFW phenomenon is not just an economic issue; it's also a reflection of our social fabric and national identity:

Family Ties: Remittances often fund family businesses, support children's education, and help maintain community ties.
Cultural Exchange: The OFW experience fosters cultural exchange between the Philippines and host countries, promoting mutual understanding and respect.
National Pride: The success of Filipinos working abroad is a source of national pride, demonstrating our people's resilience and determination.
Conclusion

The Philippines' OFWs are the backbone of our economy, sending billions of dollars back home to support their families and communities. To harness the potential of remittances and promote sustainable migration practices, policymakers must take bold action. By investing in human capital, enhancing remittance services, and promoting cultural exchange, we can build a more prosperous and inclusive society for all Filipinos.

The OFW phenomenon is a reflection of our country's complexities, contradictions, and strengths. It highlights the resilience and determination of our people, as well as our economic challenges and opportunities. As we move forward, it's essential to recognize the importance of OFWs in shaping our national identity and economy.",1
153,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is one of the most food-secure countries in Southeast Asia, but beneath the surface lies a complex web of challenges that threaten our ability to produce and provide for our nation's growing population. The country's food security situation has been shaped by decades of agricultural development, climate change, and social and economic factors. To ensure that every Filipino has access to nutritious and sufficient food, we must confront these issues head-on.

The Food Security Conundrum

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country's food availability index has increased significantly over the past decade, with an average of 2,800 calories per person per day. However, this progress is threatened by several factors:

Climate Change: Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering crop yields, affecting planting times, and increasing the spread of pests and diseases.
Soil Degradation: Soil erosion, salinization, and nutrient depletion due to intensive farming practices have reduced fertility and productivity in many areas.
Water Scarcity: Limited water resources, inefficient irrigation systems, and increased demand from other sectors (such as industry and urbanization) strain the country's water supply.
Agricultural Productivity: Low yields, inadequate fertilizers, and lack of mechanization hinder the growth of agricultural production.
The Human Side of Food Security

Food security is not just about producing food; it's also about ensuring access to nutritious and sufficient food for all Filipinos. Many communities face significant challenges:

Poverty and Inequality: Millions of Filipinos live in poverty, making them vulnerable to food insecurity.
Lack of Access to Markets: Small farmers struggle to access markets due to limited transportation infrastructure, inadequate storage facilities, and high transaction costs.
Food Waste and Losses: An estimated 40% of food produced in the country is lost or wasted, mainly due to inefficient logistics and lack of proper storage.
Policy Responses

To address these challenges, policymakers must adopt a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of food insecurity:

Sustainable Agriculture: Promote agroecological practices that maintain soil health, conserve water, and reduce chemical inputs.
Support Small-Scale Farmers: Implement policies that support small farmers, such as subsidies for irrigation systems, training in market-oriented agriculture, and access to credit facilities.
Food Systems Development: Strengthen the food system by investing in infrastructure (e.g., roads, storage facilities), promoting fair trade practices, and enhancing the role of women in agriculture.
Investing in Food Security

The Philippine government has made progress in addressing food security challenges:

National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI): NARI's research and development programs focus on improving crop yields, disease resistance, and climate-resilient agricultural systems.
Department of Agriculture (DA): The DA has implemented various initiatives to support small farmers, improve irrigation systems, and promote agricultural productivity.
However, more needs to be done:

Invest in Irrigation Systems: Upgrade the country's irrigation infrastructure to make it more efficient and sustainable.
Promote Climate-Resilient Agriculture: Encourage farming practices that are resistant to climate change, such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture.
Enhance Food Waste Reduction: Implement policies to reduce food waste and losses through better logistics, storage facilities, and marketing strategies.
Conclusion

The Philippines' food security situation is complex and multifaceted. To ensure that every Filipino has access to nutritious and sufficient food, we must address the root causes of food insecurity – climate change, soil degradation, water scarcity, and agricultural productivity challenges. Policymakers must adopt a comprehensive approach that supports sustainable agriculture, small-scale farmers, and food systems development.

As we move forward, it is essential to recognize the critical role that every Filipino plays in ensuring our nation's food security. By working together, we can build a more resilient and inclusive food system that benefits everyone.",1
154,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is one of the most digitally connected countries in Southeast Asia, but despite this progress, the country still lags behind in terms of accessibility to technology. The digital divide between the rich and the poor, urban and rural areas, is a pressing concern that hinders economic growth, social equality, and overall development.

The Digital Divide

In 2020, only about 30% of households in the Philippines had internet access, with rural areas having significantly lower rates (about 10%) compared to urban areas (around 60%). This disparity affects not only access to information but also limits opportunities for education, employment, and healthcare.

Economic Implications: The lack of digital access hinders economic growth by limiting small businesses' ability to participate in the global market, reducing productivity, and creating a brain drain.
Social Consequences: Limited digital access exacerbates poverty, social inequality, and exclusion, particularly among marginalized communities.
Education Disparities: Online learning opportunities are inaccessible to many students in rural areas, hindering their ability to compete with urban peers.
Barriers to Accessibility

Several factors contribute to the digital divide:

Infrastructure Challenges: Limited internet penetration, poor network quality, and inadequate infrastructure hinder connectivity.
Affordability: High costs of smartphones, data plans, and internet services create a barrier for low-income households.
Digital Literacy: Limited access to digital literacy training programs leaves many unprepared to navigate the digital world.
Government Efforts

The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives to address the digital divide:

National Broadband Plan 2018-2025: Aims to increase broadband coverage and speed, with a target of at least 80% of households having access by 2022.
Digital Philippines Program: Focuses on promoting digital literacy, skills training, and entrepreneurship development.
However, more needs to be done:

Invest in Infrastructure: Upgrade existing infrastructure and expand rural internet coverage to ensure equitable access.
Affordable Solutions: Develop affordable data plans, devices, and services that cater to low-income households.
Digital Literacy Training: Intensify digital literacy training programs to equip Filipinos with the necessary skills.
Private Sector Initiatives

The private sector has also taken steps to address the digital divide:

Telecom Operators' Initiatives: Telecos like Globe, Smart, and PLDT have launched initiatives such as mobile internet services for rural areas.
Digital Payment Systems: Mobile payment platforms like PayMaya, GCash, and Cashbee facilitate financial transactions in underserved communities.
Conclusion

The Philippines has made significant progress in increasing digital access, but much work remains to be done. To bridge the digital divide, policymakers, private sector players, and civil society must collaborate to:

Invest in Infrastructure: Upgrade existing infrastructure and expand rural internet coverage.
Promote Digital Literacy: Develop training programs that equip Filipinos with essential digital skills.

156,Llama3.2,"The Philippines has long been a unitary state, with a centralized government and a strong emphasis on national unity. However, as the country continues to grow and develop, many are now asking whether federalism could be the key to unlocking its true potential.

What is Federalism?

Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. This allows for greater autonomy and flexibility at the local level, while also providing a framework for national unity and cooperation.

Why Federalism Now?

The Philippines has many compelling reasons to consider federalism:

Regional Disparities: The country is home to vast regional disparities in economic development, infrastructure, and access to services. Federalism could provide a more effective way of addressing these disparities by giving regions greater autonomy.
Municipal Governance: Municipal governments are often overwhelmed by the tasks of providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Federalism could provide a more efficient way of delivering services at the local level.
National Unity: Federalism could help to promote national unity by giving regions a greater sense of ownership and participation in national decision-making.
Benefits of Federalism

Federalism has many benefits for the Philippines:

Increased Autonomy: Regions would have greater autonomy to make decisions about their own affairs, allowing them to tailor policies to their specific needs.
Improved Delivery of Services: Federalism could lead to more efficient delivery of services at the local level, reducing bureaucracy and increasing access to essential services.
Economic Growth: Federalism could help to promote economic growth by giving regions greater control over their own economic development strategies.
Challenges and Concerns

However, there are also many challenges and concerns associated with federalism:

Institutional Framework: The institutional framework for a federal system would need to be established, including the creation of new institutions such as regional governments and assemblies.
Power Dynamics: There is a risk that power dynamics could shift in favor of regions with greater economic or military strength, potentially leading to fragmentation and instability.
Financial Challenges: The financial implications of federalism would need to be carefully considered, including the potential for increased costs and decreased revenue.
A Path Forward

So what can be done to make federalism a reality in the Philippines?

Constitutional Reform: A constitutional reform process could begin by exploring the possibility of federalism and its implications for the country.
Regional Autonomy: Regions would need to demonstrate their ability to govern themselves effectively, with a focus on delivering basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
National Dialogue: A national dialogue would be necessary to ensure that all stakeholders are heard and considered in the decision-making process.
Conclusion

The Philippines has many compelling reasons to consider federalism. By giving regions greater autonomy and promoting national unity, federalism could help to unlock the country's true potential and create a more prosperous and equitable society for all.

157,Llama3.2,"As the country prepares for another round of elections, concerns are growing about the lack of transparency in campaign finance. The practice of ""kampanaryo"" – or ""campaigning"" as it is colloquially known – has become a lucrative business, with politicians and party officials using their vast networks to solicit funds from wealthy donors.

The Problem with Kamsahanan

Kampanaryo is often associated with bribery, extortion, and other forms of corruption. The practice involves individuals offering large sums of money or favors in exchange for votes or support during elections. This system can lead to a culture of entitlement among politicians, where they believe that their power and influence are bought and paid for.

The Need for Transparency

Transparency is essential in campaign finance to ensure that the electoral process remains fair and free from corruption. Without it, voters may feel coerced into supporting candidates who have been bought off by wealthy donors.

Disclosure Requirements: Candidates and parties should be required to disclose their sources of funding and any financial transactions related to their campaigns.
Campaign Finance Regulations: Strict regulations should be implemented to prevent money laundering and ensure that campaign finance laws are enforced.
Independent Oversight: An independent agency should be established to oversee campaign finance and investigate any allegations of corruption.
The Role of the Election Commission

The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) plays a critical role in ensuring transparency in campaign finance. However, its effectiveness has been hampered by inadequate resources and a lack of political will.

Enhanced Disclosure Requirements: The COMElec should be empowered to enforce stricter disclosure requirements for candidates and parties.
Increased Resources: The agency should receive adequate funding and resources to conduct thorough investigations and enforcement actions.
Independent Oversight: The COMELEC should have the authority to investigate allegations of corruption and ensure that campaign finance laws are enforced.
Civil Society and Media

Civil society organizations and the media also play a crucial role in promoting transparency in campaign finance.

Whistleblower Protection: Whistleblowers who report instances of corruption or irregularities in campaign finance should be protected from retaliation.
Media Scrutiny: The media should scrutinize campaign finance practices and hold candidates and parties accountable for any wrongdoing.
Public Education: Public education campaigns should be launched to inform voters about the importance of transparency in campaign finance.
Conclusion

The lack of transparency in campaign finance is a major concern that threatens the integrity of our electoral process. It is essential that we take bold steps to address this issue and ensure that elections are free from corruption and coercion.

By implementing stricter disclosure requirements, increasing resources for the COMELEC, and promoting independent oversight, we can shine a light on the dark world of campaign finance and create a more transparent and accountable electoral system.",1

159,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is often touted as one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, but beneath its gleaming skyscrapers and bustling streets lies a tangled web of urban congestion and housing shortages that are suffocating the country's most vulnerable populations.

A Perfect Storm of Development

The Philippines has been experiencing rapid economic growth over the past few decades, with many cities expanding at breakneck speed to accommodate the influx of migrants seeking better opportunities. However, this surge in development has come at a cost: urban congestion and housing shortages have become entrenched problems that are straining the country's infrastructure and exacerbating poverty.

Congestion: A Silent Killer

Urban congestion is one of the most pressing issues facing the Philippines today. The capital city, Manila, alone has over 1 million vehicles on its streets, with some estimates suggesting that traffic in Metro Manila costs commuters around PHP 20 billion (USD 400 million) per year in lost productivity.

Air Pollution: Congested cities produce massive amounts of air pollution, which not only harms human health but also exacerbates climate change.
Increased Commuting Time: The longer people spend commuting, the more time they have to earn a living, which can limit their ability to afford basic needs like housing and food.
Housing Shortages: A Crisis for the Poor

The Philippines has one of the lowest homeownership rates in Asia, with around 20% of urban households unable to afford decent housing. This is exacerbated by a severe shortage of affordable housing, particularly in Manila and other major cities.

Overcrowding: Many families are forced to live in cramped conditions, with some estimates suggesting that up to 30% of Filipino households share a single room.
Poor Living Conditions: Overcrowded and poorly ventilated homes can lead to health problems like respiratory diseases and malaria.

161,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, a nation blessed with abundant natural resources and a vibrant culture, grapples with a persistent and deeply rooted issue: income inequality. This stark disparity in wealth distribution casts a long shadow over the country's social and economic landscape, hindering progress and undermining the promise of a prosperous future for all Filipinos.

A Nation Divided:

The gap between the rich and the poor in the Philippines is significant and widening. The Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality, consistently places the Philippines among the most unequal countries in Southeast Asia. This translates to a reality where a small segment of the population enjoys a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth, while a vast majority struggle to meet basic needs.

The consequences of this inequality are far-reaching and deeply concerning:

Poverty and Social Exclusion: Millions of Filipinos live in poverty, lacking access to basic necessities like food, clean water, and healthcare. This poverty cycle perpetuates itself, trapping families in a cycle of deprivation and limiting their opportunities for social and economic mobility.
Social Unrest and Instability: Extreme inequality fuels social unrest and instability. The frustration and resentment felt by the marginalized can manifest in various forms, from social protests and crime to political instability.
Limited Economic Growth: Inequality hinders economic growth. When a significant portion of the population lacks access to resources and opportunities, the overall economic potential of the nation remains unrealized.
Weakened Social Fabric: The widening gap between the rich and the poor erodes the social fabric of the nation. It fosters feelings of resentment, distrust, and division among citizens, undermining social cohesion and national unity.
Root Causes of Inequality:

Several factors contribute to the high levels of income inequality in the Philippines:

Unequal Access to Education: Quality education is crucial for social and economic mobility. However, access to quality education remains unequal, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and between the rich and the poor.
Limited Job Opportunities: While the Philippine economy has experienced growth, job creation has not kept pace with the rapidly growing population. This leads to high unemployment and underemployment rates, particularly among the youth and those with limited skills.
Land Reform Challenges: Despite decades of efforts, land reform remains an unfinished agenda. Many Filipino farmers continue to face challenges such as landlessness, low productivity, and limited access to markets, trapping them in poverty.
Corruption and Inefficient Governance: Corruption at all levels of government siphons off resources that could be used for social programs and infrastructure development, further exacerbating inequality.
Weak Social Safety Nets: The government's social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, while helpful, are often insufficient to address the complex needs of the most vulnerable populations.
Addressing the Challenge:

Tackling income inequality requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of the problem. Key strategies include:

Investing in Human Capital: Prioritizing investments in education, from early childhood development to higher education, is crucial. This includes improving access to quality education for all, expanding vocational training programs, and strengthening the skills of the workforce to meet the demands of the modern economy.
Promoting Inclusive Growth: Economic growth must be inclusive and benefit all sectors of society. This requires policies that support small and medium enterprises, promote rural development, and create decent jobs for all Filipinos.
Land Reform and Agrarian Reform: Implementing genuine land reform is essential to empower farmers and improve agricultural productivity. This includes providing farmers with secure land tenure, access to credit, and support for sustainable agricultural practices.
Strengthening Social Safety Nets: Expanding and improving social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, is crucial to protect the most vulnerable members of society from poverty and ensure their basic needs are met.
Good Governance and Transparency: Combating corruption and promoting good governance are essential to ensure that public resources are used effectively and efficiently for the benefit of all Filipinos.
Empowering Women and Marginalized Groups: Empowering women and marginalized groups, such as indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities, is crucial for reducing inequality and promoting social justice.
Conclusion:

Income inequality is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a sustained and concerted effort from the government, the private sector, and civil society. By addressing the root causes of inequality, investing in human capital, promoting inclusive growth, and strengthening social safety nets, the Philippines can build a more equitable and just society where all Filipinos have the opportunity to thrive.

This is not merely a social justice issue; it is an economic imperative. A more equitable society is a more stable and prosperous society. By tackling income inequality, the Philippines can unleash its full potential and build a brighter future for all its citizens.",1
162,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines stands as a testament to the global phenomenon of labor migration. Millions of Filipinos, known as Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), have left their homeland in search of better opportunities abroad. While their remittances have become a crucial lifeline for the Philippine economy, this reliance presents a complex paradox: progress fueled by a significant human cost.   

The Economic Lifeline:

OFW remittances constitute a substantial portion of the Philippine economy, surpassing even foreign direct investment. These funds directly impact household consumption, driving demand for goods and services, and contributing significantly to poverty reduction. Remittances have fueled infrastructure development, supported education, and improved living standards for many Filipino families.

Furthermore, OFWs contribute significantly to foreign exchange reserves, bolstering the country's balance of payments. Their skills and expertise acquired abroad can potentially contribute to the development of the domestic workforce upon their return, although the extent of this ""brain gain"" remains a subject of debate.   

The Human Cost:

However, the economic benefits of OFW remittances come at a significant human cost. The prolonged separation of families can have profound social and emotional consequences, leading to strained relationships, broken families, and even the erosion of traditional family values. Children of OFWs often experience emotional distress, neglect, and difficulties in their social and academic development.   

The physical and emotional well-being of OFWs themselves is also a major concern. They face numerous challenges abroad, including exploitation, abuse, and discrimination. Issues such as unfair labor practices, wage theft, and even human trafficking remain prevalent despite government efforts to protect their rights. The psychological toll of living and working far from home, often under stressful conditions, can lead to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.   

Beyond Remittances: A Path Towards Sustainable Development

The Philippine government must shift its focus beyond mere reliance on remittances and strive towards creating a more sustainable and equitable economic model. This requires a multi-pronged approach:

Investing in Human Capital: Prioritizing investments in education and skills development is crucial to equip Filipinos with the necessary skills to compete in the global job market and create a more robust domestic economy.
Promoting Job Creation: The government must actively promote job creation within the Philippines through policies that encourage entrepreneurship, support small and medium enterprises, and invest in key sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and agriculture.   
Addressing Root Causes of Migration: Addressing the root causes of labor migration, such as poverty, unemployment, and inequality, is essential. This requires implementing effective social safety nets, improving access to quality healthcare and education, and promoting inclusive growth that benefits all sectors of society.
Protecting the Rights of OFWs: Strengthening the legal framework for the protection of OFWs' rights, ensuring their safety and well-being abroad, and providing effective mechanisms for addressing grievances are crucial.
Harnessing the Skills and Expertise of Returning OFWs: The government must implement programs to effectively reintegrate returning OFWs into the Philippine workforce, leveraging their skills and experience to contribute to national development.
Conclusion:

The phenomenon of OFW migration presents a complex challenge for the Philippines. While remittances have played a vital role in supporting the economy, it is crucial to recognize the human cost associated with this reliance. The government must strive to create a more sustainable and equitable economic model that reduces the need for Filipinos to seek employment abroad. By investing in human capital, promoting job creation, and protecting the rights of OFWs, the Philippines can harness the potential of its human resources while ensuring the well-being of its citizens both at home and abroad.",1

166,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Shifting Sands of Power: A Look at the Philippines' Federalism Debate
The concept of federalism has long lingered in the Philippine political discourse, a tantalizing promise of decentralized power and responsive governance. Like a stubborn ghost, it resurfaces periodically, igniting passionate debates and stirring deep-seated anxieties. For a nation grappling with persistent regional disparities, bureaucratic bottlenecks, and the enduring legacy of centralized authority, federalism presents itself as a potential panacea. But is it a cure-all, or a risky experiment that could exacerbate existing problems?   

The allure of federalism lies in its promise of empowerment. Advocates argue that it would redistribute power from the ""Imperial Manila,"" allowing regional governments to tailor policies to their specific needs and circumstances. They envision a system where local leaders, more attuned to the nuances of their communities, can make decisions that directly impact their constituents. This, they believe, would foster greater accountability, promote economic development, and address the unique challenges faced by diverse regions.

Consider the vast disparities that characterize the Philippine archipelago. While Metro Manila thrives as the economic and political hub, many provinces languish in poverty, lacking basic infrastructure and essential services. Federalism, proponents argue, would enable these regions to leverage their resources, attract investments, and chart their own paths to prosperity. They point to the potential for regions rich in natural resources to manage their wealth more effectively, ensuring that the benefits accrue to their communities rather than being siphoned off to the national capital.   

Furthermore, federalism is touted as a means of fostering peace and stability in conflict-ridden areas. In regions like Mindanao, where historical grievances and cultural differences have fueled decades of insurgency, a federal structure could provide greater autonomy, allowing local communities to address their specific concerns and participate meaningfully in governance. This, it is believed, could pave the way for lasting peace and reconciliation.   

However, the path to federalism is fraught with challenges. Critics raise concerns about the potential for increased regional disparities, the rise of political dynasties, and the weakening of national unity. They argue that some regions, lacking the necessary resources and expertise, may struggle to function effectively under a federal system, leading to further economic imbalances.   

The specter of political dynasties looms large in the federalism debate. In a country where political families often wield considerable influence, there are fears that federalism could simply devolve into a system of regional fiefdoms, where local elites consolidate power and perpetuate their control. This could undermine the very principles of democracy and accountability that federalism is supposed to uphold.

Moreover, the transition to a federal system would require a significant overhaul of the existing political and administrative structure. This would involve amending the Constitution, restructuring government agencies, and redistributing resources. The process would be complex, costly, and potentially divisive, requiring a high degree of political will and public support.

The issue of revenue sharing also presents a significant hurdle. How would the distribution of national revenues be managed under a federal system? How would the financial needs of the national government be balanced against the demands of regional governments? These are complex questions that require careful consideration and meticulous planning.

Furthermore, the issue of national unity cannot be ignored. The Philippines, with its diverse cultural and linguistic landscape, has always striven to maintain a sense of national identity. Critics argue that federalism could weaken this sense of unity, leading to regional fragmentation and even secession. They point to the potential for regional governments to prioritize their own interests over the national interest, leading to conflicts and rivalries.   

The success of federalism hinges on the establishment of strong institutions and effective mechanisms for accountability. It requires a robust system of checks and balances, an independent judiciary, and a vibrant civil society. Without these safeguards, federalism could easily degenerate into a system of patronage and corruption.

The debate surrounding federalism in the Philippines is not merely a technical discussion about political structures. It is a fundamental question about the nature of power, the distribution of resources, and the future of the nation. It is a debate that reflects the deep-seated anxieties and aspirations of a people grappling with the challenges of development and democracy.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt federalism is a political one. It requires a careful assessment of the potential benefits and risks, a thorough understanding of the specific context of the Philippines, and a genuine commitment to addressing the concerns of all stakeholders. It requires careful planning, meticulous execution, and a unwavering commitment to good governance.

The shifting sands of power in the Philippines continue to reshape the political landscape. Whether federalism will prove to be a stabilizing force or a destabilizing influence remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the debate will continue, and the future of the nation hangs in the balance. The nation must carefully weigh the choices, and decide if the potential rewards outweigh the inherent risks.",1
167,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippine electoral system has long been a battleground for political ideals, leadership visions, and the will of the people. But beneath the slogans, posters, and rallies lies an often-overlooked yet crucial issue: campaign financing. Who funds our politicians? How is the money spent? And why does financial transparency remain a persistent problem in our elections?

The Role of Money in Elections

Elections in the Philippines are expensive. From television ads and social media campaigns to rallies and voter outreach programs, running for public office requires vast financial resources. The cost of campaigning can easily reach millions, even billions, of pesos, especially for national positions such as the presidency or senatorial seats. While campaign contributions and personal funds fuel these efforts, the lack of transparency raises concerns about the integrity of the democratic process.

In theory, election campaign finance is regulated under Philippine law. The Omnibus Election Code, along with the Fair Elections Act and guidelines from the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), sets spending limits and requires candidates to disclose financial reports. But the reality is far from ideal. Many candidates exceed legal spending caps, accept questionable donations, or fail to submit accurate financial reports, often with minimal consequences.

Weaknesses in Campaign Finance Transparency

Lack of Strict Enforcement – COMELEC requires candidates to submit Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE), but enforcement is weak. Many candidates either delay submission, underreport expenses, or fail to file their reports entirely. While penalties exist, these are often too lenient to deter violations.

Influence of Wealthy Donors and Business Interests – Big businesses, political dynasties, and influential figures often bankroll candidates, creating potential conflicts of interest. Without strict disclosure requirements, voters remain unaware of who truly influences elected officials.

Dark Money and Untraceable Spending – Political advertisements, particularly in the digital space, can be funded by anonymous donors. The rise of social media campaigning, with its relatively lax regulations, makes it even harder to track campaign financing.

Loopholes in Political Party Financing – Unlike other democracies where political parties receive state funding, Philippine parties rely heavily on private donors. This fosters patronage politics, where business tycoons and power brokers use campaign contributions to secure favors.

Why Transparency Matters

Financial transparency in elections is not just a bureaucratic requirement—it is a cornerstone of democracy. When voters know where a candidate’s funding comes from, they can make informed decisions. Greater transparency also deters corruption, reduces undue influence from oligarchs, and levels the playing field for candidates with fewer financial backers.

Moreover, countries with strong campaign finance laws demonstrate more robust democratic institutions. For example, nations like Canada and Germany impose strict disclosure rules and public funding mechanisms, ensuring greater accountability. The Philippines can take cues from these systems to strengthen its own.

Steps Toward Reform

To enhance financial transparency in Philippine elections, several measures should be pursued:

Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms – COMELEC must be given more power and resources to audit campaign finances, impose real-time monitoring, and penalize violators effectively.

Enhancing Digital Transparency – With social media playing a dominant role in modern campaigns, platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok must be held accountable for disclosing political ad funding sources.

Public Campaign Financing – Introducing a system where government funding supports candidates could reduce reliance on private donors and create a fairer electoral landscape.

Increasing Civil Society and Media Oversight – NGOs and independent media must continue investigative efforts to expose hidden campaign funders and election irregularities.

A Call for Action

The 2025 midterm elections and the 2028 presidential race will test the country’s ability to uphold electoral integrity. If campaign finance transparency remains weak, political elites will continue to dominate, and governance may be compromised by private interests.

As voters, we must demand accountability. The future of Philippine democracy depends on an electoral system where money serves the people—not the other way around.",1
168,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines has a long and complex history of mental health stigma. This stigma is a major barrier to people seeking and receiving mental health care. It can also lead to discrimination and social isolation.

There are many factors that contribute to the Philippines' mental health stigma. One factor is the lack of awareness and education about mental health. Many people in the Philippines do not understand what mental illness is or how to get help. This can lead to people being afraid to seek help or to talk about their mental health concerns.

Another factor is the cultural taboo around mental illness. In the Philippines, mental illness is often seen as a sign of weakness or shame. This can make it difficult for people to admit that they are struggling with their mental health.

The economic burden of mental illness is also a significant factor. Mental illness can be expensive to treat. This can make it difficult for people to afford the care they need.

The Philippines' government has taken some steps to address the mental health stigma. In 2018, the Mental Health Act was passed. This law aims to improve access to mental health care and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness.

However, there is still much work to be done. The Philippines needs to increase awareness and education about mental health. It also needs to invest in more mental health services.

The Philippines' mental health stigma is a complex issue. However, it is an issue that can be addressed. By working together, we can create a more accepting and supportive environment for people with mental illness.

What can you do to help?

There are many things that you can do to help reduce the Philippines' mental health stigma. Here are a few ideas:

Learn more about mental health.
Talk openly about mental health.
Support people with mental illness.
Advocate for mental health awareness and education.
Donate to mental health organizations.

169,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines is experiencing rapid urbanization, which is leading to a number of challenges, including urban congestion and housing shortages. These challenges are having a significant impact on the quality of life for Filipinos living in urban areas.

Urban Congestion

The Philippines has one of the highest rates of urbanization in the world. This is due to a number of factors, including the high birth rate, the influx of people from rural areas, and the limited availability of jobs and opportunities in rural areas. As a result, the country's urban areas are becoming increasingly congested.

The congestion is having a number of negative impacts on the quality of life for Filipinos living in urban areas. It is making it difficult to get around, increasing pollution levels, and making it difficult to find affordable housing.

Housing Shortages

The Philippines is also experiencing a housing shortage. This is due to the rapid pace of urbanization and the lack of affordable housing options. As a result, many Filipinos are living in overcrowded and substandard housing.

The housing shortage is having a number of negative impacts on the quality of life for Filipinos living in urban areas. It is making it difficult to find affordable housing, increasing the risk of homelessness, and making it difficult to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

The Government's Response

The Philippine government is aware of the challenges of urban congestion and housing shortages. It has taken a number of steps to address these challenges, including:

Increasing investment in infrastructure, such as roads and public transportation
Implementing policies to encourage the development of affordable housing
Providing subsidies to low-income families to help them afford housing
What More Can Be Done?

The Philippine government needs to continue to take steps to address the challenges of urban congestion and housing shortages. It is also important for the private sector to play a role in addressing these challenges.

170,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines is facing a severe plastic pollution crisis. The country is one of the world's largest contributors to plastic pollution in the ocean. This is due to a number of factors, including the country's large population, its high rate of plastic consumption, and its limited waste management infrastructure.

The Philippines' plastic pollution crisis is having a significant impact on the environment and the economy. It is harming marine life, polluting waterways, and making it difficult to fish and farm. It is also estimated to cost the country billions of dollars each year in lost tourism revenue and environmental damage.

The Philippine government is aware of the plastic pollution crisis and has taken a number of steps to address it. In 2018, the government passed a law banning single-use plastics. The law has been effective in reducing the use of single-use plastics, but it has also had some unintended consequences. For example, the ban has led to an increase in the use of reusable plastic bags, which are often not properly recycled.

The Philippine government is also working to improve waste management infrastructure. This includes building more landfills and waste-to-energy plants. However, these efforts are not keeping pace with the country's growing waste generation.

What More Can Be Done?

The Philippine government needs to continue to take steps to address the plastic pollution crisis. This includes:

Enforcing the ban on single-use plastics
Investing in waste management infrastructure

171,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, a land of breathtaking landscapes and vibrant culture, is also a nation starkly divided. While a burgeoning middle class and a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals enjoy the fruits of economic growth, a significant portion of the population remains trapped in a cycle of poverty, highlighting the persistent and deeply entrenched issue of income inequality. This disparity isn't merely a statistic; it's a lived reality that shapes opportunities, access to resources, and the very fabric of Philippine society.   

The starkness of this inequality is evident in the Gini coefficient, a common measure of income distribution. While figures fluctuate depending on the source and methodology, the Philippines consistently ranks among the countries with a relatively high Gini coefficient in Southeast Asia. This translates to a situation where a small percentage of the population controls a disproportionately large share of the nation's wealth.   

Several factors contribute to this persistent inequality. One crucial element is the historical legacy of land ownership. Land reforms, while well-intentioned, have often fallen short of their goals, leaving many farmers and agricultural workers landless or with insufficient land to sustain themselves. This perpetuates a cycle of poverty in rural areas, where a significant portion of the population resides.   

Furthermore, the concentration of economic activity in urban centers, particularly Metro Manila, exacerbates the divide. While these areas offer greater opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship, they also face challenges such as high living costs, traffic congestion, and inadequate infrastructure, which disproportionately affect low-income residents. This urban-rural divide creates a situation where those in rural areas are often left behind, lacking access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential services.   

Education plays a pivotal role in addressing income inequality, but the Philippine education system faces significant challenges. Access to quality education is often determined by socioeconomic status, with wealthier families able to afford private schools and supplementary resources. Public schools, particularly in rural areas, often struggle with inadequate funding, teacher shortages, and limited resources. This disparity in educational opportunities perpetuates the cycle of poverty, as individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to acquire the skills and qualifications necessary for well-paying jobs.   

The labor market also contributes to income inequality. The prevalence of contractualization, or ""endo"" (end of contract), undermines job security and limits access to benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans. This practice disproportionately affects low-skilled workers, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation and economic instability. Furthermore, the informal economy, where many Filipinos work without formal contracts or social protection, further exacerbates the problem.   

The impact of income inequality extends beyond economic hardship. It also has significant social and political consequences. It can lead to social unrest, as marginalized communities feel increasingly alienated and disenfranchised. It can also undermine democratic institutions, as the concentration of wealth and power can lead to political influence that favors the elite.   

Addressing income inequality requires a multifaceted approach that tackles the root causes of the problem. Land reform, while challenging, remains crucial for addressing rural poverty. Investing in education and healthcare, particularly in rural areas, is essential for providing equal opportunities for all Filipinos. Strengthening labor laws and promoting job security can help protect vulnerable workers and reduce exploitation.   

Furthermore, the government needs to implement progressive taxation policies that redistribute wealth and generate revenue for social programs. Cracking down on tax evasion and corruption is also crucial for ensuring that public funds are used effectively and equitably. Promoting inclusive economic growth that benefits all segments of society, rather than just a select few, is essential for creating a more just and equitable Philippines.

Beyond government action, the private sector also has a role to play. Businesses can contribute to reducing income inequality by paying fair wages, providing decent working conditions, and investing in employee training and development. They can also support social enterprises and initiatives that create opportunities for marginalized communities.

Civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations play a vital role in advocating for the rights of the poor and marginalized. They can provide essential services, raise awareness about income inequality, and hold the government and private sector accountable.   

Ultimately, addressing income inequality requires a collective effort from all sectors of society. It requires a commitment to creating a more just and equitable Philippines, where all citizens have the opportunity to thrive. It necessitates a shift in mindset, from viewing economic growth as an end in itself to recognizing it as a means to achieve social progress and well-being for all.

The archipelago of disparity cannot persist. The Philippines, with its rich history and resilient people, has the potential to become a beacon of inclusive growth and social justice. By tackling the root causes of income inequality, the nation can unlock its full potential and create a brighter future for all its citizens. The journey will be long and arduous, but the destination—a more equitable and prosperous Philippines—is worth the effort.",1
172,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines has long been known as a land of opportunity, but for many Filipinos, the promise of a better life lies beyond its shores. Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) have become an integral part of the country's economic landscape, their remittances providing a lifeline for families and communities across the archipelago. However, the complex relationship between OFWs and the Philippine economy is a multifaceted one, with both significant benefits and challenges.

The Economic Impact of OFWs

OFWs are often hailed as modern-day heroes, their sacrifices contributing significantly to the Philippine economy. Remittances, the money sent back by OFWs to their families in the Philippines, have become a major source of foreign exchange, surpassing even tourism revenues in recent years. These funds are used to support basic needs such as food, education, and healthcare, and also stimulate domestic consumption and investment.

Moreover, OFWs gain valuable skills and experience abroad, which they can bring back to the Philippines upon their return. This knowledge transfer can benefit various sectors of the economy, from healthcare and education to business and technology. Additionally, OFWs often invest in businesses and real estate in the Philippines, further contributing to economic growth.

Challenges and Concerns

While the contributions of OFWs are undeniable, there are also challenges and concerns associated with their presence. The reliance on remittances can create a dependency on foreign income, potentially hindering the development of domestic industries and job creation. The brain drain, or the loss of skilled professionals to foreign countries, can also have a negative impact on the Philippine economy.

Furthermore, the welfare and protection of OFWs remain a significant concern. Many OFWs face challenges such as exploitation, abuse, and even human trafficking. The Philippine government has implemented various measures to protect the rights of OFWs, but more needs to be done to ensure their safety and well-being.

The Way Forward

To maximize the benefits of OFWs while mitigating the risks, a comprehensive and sustainable strategy is needed. This should include:

Investing in education and skills development to equip Filipinos with the skills needed to compete in the global job market.
Promoting the creation of decent jobs in the Philippines to reduce the need for Filipinos to seek employment abroad.
Strengthening the protection of OFWs' rights and welfare, both at home and abroad.
Encouraging OFWs to invest their knowledge and skills in the Philippine economy upon their return.
Diversifying the economy to reduce reliance on remittances.
By addressing these issues and implementing effective policies, the Philippines can harness the potential of its OFWs to drive sustainable economic growth and development. The OFWs, with their resilience, determination, and unwavering commitment to their families and communities, will continue to play a vital role in shaping the future of the Philippines.",1

176,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines has long been a unitary state, with power concentrated in the national government. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement for federalism, which would devolve power to regional governments. Proponents argue that federalism would bring greater autonomy, efficiency, and development to the regions, while opponents express concerns about potential instability and the fragmentation of the nation.

The Arguments for Federalism

Advocates of federalism believe that it would bring several benefits to the Philippines. They argue that it would allow regions to tailor their policies to their specific needs and circumstances, leading to more efficient and effective governance. They also contend that federalism would promote economic development in the regions, as they would have greater control over their resources and the ability to attract investment.

Furthermore, proponents argue that federalism would enhance political participation and empower local communities. They believe that it would give marginalized groups a greater voice in decision-making and promote greater social justice.

The Concerns About Federalism

Opponents of federalism raise several concerns about its potential consequences. They argue that it could lead to the fragmentation of the nation and exacerbate regional disparities. They also express concerns about the potential for conflict between the national government and regional governments, as well as the potential for corruption and inefficiency at the regional level.

Furthermore, opponents argue that federalism could undermine national unity and weaken the central government's ability to address national challenges. They also express concerns about the potential for secessionist movements and the erosion of national identity.

The Way Forward

The debate over federalism in the Philippines is complex and multifaceted. There is no easy answer, and the potential benefits and risks must be carefully weighed. It is important to have a thorough and open discussion about the potential consequences of federalism, taking into account the diverse perspectives and interests of all stakeholders.

Ultimately, the decision about whether or not to adopt federalism is a political one that must be made by the Filipino people. It is crucial that any decision about federalism is made through a democratic and inclusive process that reflects the will of the people.

177,Gemini1.5-flash,"In a democratic society, elections serve as the cornerstone of governance, ensuring that citizens have a voice in shaping their future. However, the integrity of the electoral process is heavily influenced by campaign financing. In the Philippines, campaign spending has long been a contentious issue, with concerns over transparency, accountability, and potential avenues for corruption. As election cycles become increasingly expensive, the call for financial transparency in political campaigns grows louder. This editorial seeks to explore the current state of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, the challenges faced in enforcing financial regulations, and the potential reforms that could strengthen democratic institutions.

The Current State of Campaign Finance in the Philippines

The Philippines has regulations in place to oversee campaign financing, primarily through the Omnibus Election Code and the Fair Elections Act. Candidates and political parties are required to disclose their sources of campaign funds, spending limits are imposed, and post-election reporting is mandated. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) serves as the primary regulatory body overseeing these financial disclosures.

Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains problematic. Many candidates and political parties either fail to submit accurate financial reports or circumvent the rules through loopholes. The lack of real-time monitoring and inadequate enforcement mechanisms have made it difficult to ensure that campaign finance laws are strictly followed.

Challenges in Ensuring Financial Transparency

Weak Enforcement and MonitoringOne of the biggest issues in campaign finance transparency is weak enforcement. COMELEC lacks the resources and manpower to conduct thorough audits of campaign finances. While financial reports are submitted, their accuracy is rarely scrutinized due to limited oversight capacity.

Undisclosed Campaign Donations and SpendingCandidates often receive campaign donations from business entities, political allies, and even foreign sources, many of which go unreported. Additionally, ""off-the-books"" spending, such as vote-buying and grassroots mobilization expenses, remains rampant and difficult to trace.

Influence of Wealthy Donors and Political DynastiesA significant portion of campaign financing in the Philippines comes from affluent individuals and business groups seeking political favor. The lack of transparency in these contributions raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest, where policies are crafted to benefit donors rather than the general public.

Social Media and Digital Advertising SpendingWith the rise of digital campaigning, social media platforms have become a battleground for political influence. However, tracking expenditures on digital ads and sponsored content remains a challenge. Many campaigns utilize third-party groups to fund online propaganda, making it difficult to account for actual spending.

Lack of Public Awareness and EngagementThe general public plays a crucial role in demanding financial transparency, yet many citizens are unaware of their right to scrutinize campaign finance records. Limited access to financial disclosures and a lack of easily digestible reports hinder public engagement on this critical issue.

Potential Reforms for Greater Transparency

To address these challenges, a multi-pronged approach involving institutional reforms, technological advancements, and public engagement is necessary. Here are some proposed solutions:

Strengthening COMELEC’s Oversight PowersIncreasing COMELEC’s budget and human resources could improve its capacity to audit campaign finance records thoroughly. Implementing harsher penalties for non-compliance, including disqualification from elections, could deter candidates from violating transparency laws.

Mandatory Real-Time Campaign Finance DisclosureA digital, publicly accessible database for campaign contributions and expenditures should be implemented. Candidates should be required to update their financial records in real-time, allowing for greater transparency and media scrutiny during the campaign period.

Regulating Third-Party Political SpendingMany political campaigns benefit from independent groups that spend heavily on advertising and voter mobilization efforts. A regulatory framework must be established to monitor these expenditures and ensure that they are properly reported.

Enhancing Digital Ad TransparencySocial media platforms should be required to disclose detailed information on political ads, including spending amounts, sources of funding, and targeted demographics. This can help curb misinformation and foreign interference in Philippine elections.

Public Education and Media InvolvementCivil society organizations and the media should play an active role in educating voters about campaign finance laws and how they can access financial records. Investigative journalism should be encouraged to expose violations and hold candidates accountable.

Conclusion

Financial transparency in election campaigns is essential to maintaining a fair and democratic electoral system. While the Philippines has made strides in regulating campaign financing, enforcement remains weak, and loopholes persist. Addressing these issues requires stronger oversight, technological innovation, and increased public participation. Without these reforms, the risk of undue influence over the electoral process remains high, ultimately undermining the democratic ideals that the Philippines aspires to uphold.",1

As a result, countless Filipinos suffer in silence, their mental well-being compromised by the weight of societal prejudice.

The Roots of Mental Health Stigma

The roots of mental health stigma in the Philippines can be traced to a complex interplay of cultural, social, and economic factors. Traditional beliefs often attribute mental illness to supernatural causes, leading to fear and ostracization. The lack of mental health literacy and awareness further fuels misconceptions and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. Moreover, the economic constraints faced by many Filipinos limit access to quality mental health care, exacerbating the problem.

The Impact of Stigma

The impact of mental health stigma is far-reaching and devastating. It prevents individuals from seeking help, delaying treatment and exacerbating mental health conditions. The fear of being labeled as ""crazy"" or ""weak"" can lead to self-isolation, social withdrawal, and even self-harm. Moreover, stigma can create a hostile environment for individuals with mental health conditions, affecting their employment prospects, relationships, and overall quality of life.

Challenging the Stigma: A Call to Action

Addressing mental health stigma requires a multi-pronged approach involving education, advocacy, and policy change. Raising awareness about mental health issues and promoting mental health literacy can help dispel myths and misconceptions. Challenging harmful stereotypes through media campaigns and public education can create a more accepting and supportive environment for individuals with mental health conditions.

Furthermore, investing in mental health services and making them more accessible to all Filipinos is crucial. This includes expanding access to mental health professionals, increasing the availability of mental health services in rural areas, and integrating mental health care into primary healthcare services.

The Role of Technology in Combating Stigma

In the digital age, technology can play a powerful role in challenging mental health stigma. Online platforms can provide a safe and anonymous space for individuals to seek support, connect with others who share similar experiences, and access mental health resources. Telehealth services can expand access to mental health care, particularly in remote and underserved areas.

A Brighter Future for Mental Health in the Philippines

Overcoming mental health stigma in the Philippines requires a collective effort from individuals, families, communities, and the government. By challenging harmful stereotypes, promoting mental health literacy, and investing in accessible mental health services, we can create a more inclusive and supportive society where individuals with mental health conditions can thrive.

The journey towards a stigma-free Philippines is not without its challenges, but it is a journey worth undertaking. By breaking down the barriers of stigma, we can empower individuals to seek help, promote mental well-being, and build a healthier and more compassionate society for all.",1

Their contributions to the economy through remittances, as well as the social and cultural impacts of their work abroad, are profound. This editorial delves into the significance of OFWs, the challenges they face, and the policies that support them.

The Economic Impact of OFWs
OFWs play a crucial role in the Philippine economy. In 2022, remittances from OFWs reached a record high of $36.14 billion, accounting for approximately 9% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)1. These remittances are vital for many Filipino families, providing a stable source of income that supports household consumption, education, healthcare, and other essential needs.

The inflow of remittances also bolsters the country's foreign exchange reserves, helping to stabilize the Philippine peso and reduce the trade deficit2. This financial support is particularly important during economic downturns, as it provides a buffer against external shocks and helps maintain economic stability.

Social and Cultural Contributions
Beyond their economic impact, OFWs contribute significantly to the social and cultural fabric of the Philippines. They are often seen as symbols of resilience and sacrifice, enduring homesickness and challenging working conditions to provide for their families. This sense of duty and commitment has earned them the title of ""Bagong Bayani"" or ""New Heroes""1.

The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) regulates the deployment of Filipino workers abroad and ensures that they are provided with fair and safe working conditions4. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) offers welfare programs, including insurance, legal assistance, and repatriation services4.

Additionally, the government has established bilateral labor agreements with several countries to safeguard the rights of Filipino workers and ensure their well-being5. These agreements are crucial in addressing issues such as contract violations, non-payment of wages, and other forms of maltreatment.

Potential Solutions and Future Outlook
To further support OFWs and maximize their contributions to the economy, several measures can be taken:

Strengthening Legal Protections: Enhancing the enforcement of labor laws and bilateral agreements can help protect OFWs from exploitation and abuse. This includes providing legal assistance and support for those who face injustices abroad5.

Promoting Financial Literacy: Educating OFWs and their families about financial management can help them make better use of remittances, leading to long-term financial stability and investment in productive ventures2.

Encouraging Return Migration: Creating opportunities for OFWs to return and reintegrate into the local economy can harness their skills and experiences for national development. This includes offering incentives for entrepreneurship and job creation3.

Improving Social Services: Enhancing access to social services such as education, healthcare, and housing for the families of OFWs can mitigate the negative impacts of family separation and improve overall well-being4.

Conclusion
Overseas Filipino Workers are indispensable to the Philippine economy and society. Their remittances provide a lifeline for millions of families and contribute significantly to national economic stability. However, the challenges they face highlight the need for continued support and protection from the government and society. By addressing these challenges and implementing supportive policies, the Philippines can ensure that the contributions of OFWs are fully realized, leading to a more prosperous and equitable future for all.",1

The Demographic Power of Youth
The Philippines is a youthful nation. As of 2022, more than half of the country's 65.7 million registered voters were between the ages of 18 and 411. This demographic power means that the youth have a substantial say in the outcome of elections and the direction of the country's political future. Their sheer numbers make them a critical constituency that politicians cannot afford to ignore.

Youth Engagement in Politics
Youth engagement in politics takes many forms, from voting and campaigning to activism and policy advocacy. The 2022 national elections saw a significant increase in youth participation, with many young Filipinos registering to vote for the first time1. This surge in political engagement was driven by a desire for change and a recognition of the power of their collective voice.

Social media has played a pivotal role in mobilizing the youth. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become arenas for political discourse, where young people share information, debate issues, and organize movements2. The digital landscape has democratized political participation, allowing even those in remote areas to engage in national conversations.

Challenges Faced by Youth in Politics
Despite their potential, Filipino youth face several challenges in the political arena:

Political Dynasties: The prevalence of political dynasties in the Philippines often stifles new voices and ideas. Young candidates without family connections or significant financial backing find it difficult to compete against established political families3.

Misinformation and Fake News: The spread of misinformation and fake news on social media platforms poses a significant challenge. Young voters, who are highly active online, are particularly vulnerable to misleading information, which can influence their political choices1.

Economic Barriers: Economic challenges also hinder youth participation in politics. Many young Filipinos are preoccupied with securing their livelihoods, leaving little time or resources for political engagement3.

186,Copilot,"The Philippines' Journey Towards Federalism: Navigating the Path to Decentralized Governance

The debate surrounding federalism in the Philippines has sparked a national conversation about the future of governance in the archipelago. Proponents of federalism argue that it offers a solution to long-standing issues such as regional inequality, inefficiencies in the delivery of public services, and the concentration of political power in Metro Manila. Opponents, however, caution against potential risks, including the exacerbation of regional disparities, increased bureaucracy, and the complexities of transitioning to a new system. This editorial delves into the multifaceted arguments for and against federalism in the Philippines, exploring the potential benefits and challenges of such a significant shift in governance.

The Case for Federalism

Addressing Regional Inequality: One of the primary arguments in favor of federalism is its potential to address regional inequality. Under the current unitary system, resources and political power are heavily concentrated in Metro Manila, leaving many regions lagging behind in terms of development. Federalism proposes to decentralize power, allowing regional governments to have greater control over their resources and decision-making processes. This could lead to more equitable distribution of resources, fostering regional development and reducing the economic divide between Metro Manila and the provinces.

Enhanced Local Governance: Federalism is seen as a means to enhance local governance by empowering regional governments to tailor policies and programs to their specific needs. Local leaders, being more attuned to the unique challenges and opportunities of their regions, could implement more effective and contextually appropriate solutions. This could result in improved public services, increased accountability, and greater citizen participation in the democratic process.

Political and Cultural Diversity: The Philippines is a diverse country with a rich tapestry of cultures, languages, and traditions. Federalism could provide a framework for recognizing and accommodating this diversity by granting regions greater autonomy in matters such as education, cultural preservation, and local governance. By fostering a sense of regional identity and pride, federalism could strengthen the fabric of the nation while respecting its inherent diversity.

The Case Against Federalism

Risk of Exacerbating Regional Disparities: Critics of federalism argue that it could exacerbate existing regional disparities. Wealthier regions with more developed economies and infrastructure may thrive under a federal system, while poorer regions could struggle to generate sufficient revenue and attract investment. This could lead to a widening gap between regions, undermining the goal of equitable development.

Increased Bureaucracy and Costs: Transitioning to a federal system would require significant changes to the country's political and administrative structures. This could result in increased bureaucracy and administrative costs, potentially burdening taxpayers and complicating the delivery of public services. Critics also point out that the transition process itself could be lengthy and complex, diverting attention and resources away from pressing national issues.

Challenges of Governance and Coordination: Federalism could pose challenges in terms of governance and coordination between the national and regional governments. Ensuring consistency in national policies, such as defense, foreign affairs, and environmental protection, while allowing regional autonomy, could prove to be a delicate balancing act. Additionally, there is a risk of regional governments pursuing conflicting agendas, which could lead to inefficiencies and hinder national progress.

The Way Forward

The debate on federalism in the Philippines is far from settled, and any move towards a federal system would require careful consideration and extensive dialogue. Key stakeholders, including government officials, civil society organizations, and the public, must engage in open and informed discussions to weigh the potential benefits and risks. A thorough examination of successful federal systems in other countries, as well as an assessment of the Philippines' unique context, can provide valuable insights.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt federalism should be guided by the goal of creating a more equitable, efficient, and inclusive governance system that serves the best interests of all Filipinos. Whether federalism is the right path for the Philippines remains to be seen, but the ongoing conversation is an important step towards envisioning a better future for the nation.",1
187,Copilot,"In the Philippines, elections are a cornerstone of democracy, providing citizens with the opportunity to choose their leaders and representatives. However, the integrity of this democratic process is often undermined by issues related to campaign finance. Financial transparency in election campaigns is crucial to ensure fair and honest elections, prevent corruption, and maintain public trust in the electoral system. This editorial explores the significance of financial transparency in Philippine election campaigns, the current challenges, and potential solutions to enhance transparency and accountability.

The Need for Financial Transparency

Preventing Corruption: Financial transparency is essential to prevent corruption in election campaigns. When candidates and political parties disclose their sources of funding and expenditures, it becomes easier to identify and address potential conflicts of interest and illicit financial activities. Transparency helps ensure that candidates are not beholden to special interests or engaging in corrupt practices to secure votes.

Ensuring Fair Competition: Transparency in campaign finance levels the playing field for all candidates, regardless of their financial resources. Wealthy candidates often have a significant advantage in elections due to their ability to spend large sums of money on advertisements, rallies, and other campaign activities. By enforcing strict regulations on campaign spending and requiring detailed financial disclosures, the electoral process becomes more equitable, allowing candidates with fewer financial resources to compete fairly.

Building Public Trust: Public trust in the electoral system is fundamental to the functioning of a democracy. When citizens believe that elections are conducted fairly and transparently, they are more likely to participate in the democratic process and accept the results. Financial transparency in election campaigns fosters trust by demonstrating that candidates and political parties are accountable to the public and adhere to ethical standards.

Challenges to Financial Transparency

Inadequate Enforcement: One of the primary challenges to financial transparency in Philippine election campaigns is the inadequate enforcement of existing laws and regulations. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) is responsible for overseeing campaign finance, but it often lacks the resources and capacity to effectively monitor and enforce compliance. This results in candidates and political parties failing to submit accurate and timely financial disclosures, undermining the transparency of the electoral process.

Loopholes in the Law: The current legal framework governing campaign finance in the Philippines has several loopholes that allow candidates and political parties to circumvent transparency requirements. For example, the Omnibus Election Code and Republic Act No. 7166 mandate the submission of a Statement of Contributions and Expenses (SOCE), but the penalties for non-compliance are often insufficient to deter violations. Additionally, the law does not adequately address the issue of anonymous donations, which can be used to hide the true sources of campaign funding.

Influence of Wealthy Donors: The influence of wealthy donors in Philippine elections is a significant barrier to financial transparency. Large contributions from wealthy individuals and corporations can create an uneven playing field and raise concerns about the undue influence of money in politics. Without stringent regulations and transparency measures, it is difficult to ensure that campaign contributions do not compromise the integrity of the electoral process.

Potential Solutions

Strengthening Legal Frameworks: To enhance financial transparency in election campaigns, it is essential to strengthen the legal frameworks governing campaign finance. This includes increasing the penalties for non-compliance with financial disclosure requirements, closing loopholes that allow for anonymous donations, and implementing stricter regulations on campaign spending. Legislative reforms should also focus on improving the capacity of COMELEC to monitor and enforce compliance with campaign finance laws.

Additionally, limits on the size of individual contributions can help reduce the influence of money in politics and promote fair competition.

Leveraging Technology: Technology can play a vital role in enhancing financial transparency in election campaigns. Online platforms can be used to facilitate the submission and publication of financial disclosures, making it easier for the public to access and review campaign finance information. Additionally, digital tools can help COMELEC monitor campaign spending in real-time and identify potential violations more efficiently.

Voter Education: Educating voters about the importance of financial transparency in election campaigns is essential to promote accountability and informed decision-making. Voter education programs should emphasize the significance of campaign finance regulations and encourage citizens to scrutinize the financial activities of candidates and political parties. An informed electorate is better equipped to hold candidates accountable and demand transparency in the electoral process.

Conclusion

Financial transparency in Philippine election campaigns is crucial to ensuring fair and honest elections, preventing corruption, and maintaining public trust in the democratic process. While there are significant challenges to achieving transparency, including inadequate enforcement, legal loopholes, and the influence of wealthy donors, there are also viable solutions. Strengthening legal frameworks, promoting donor transparency, leveraging technology, and educating voters are essential steps towards enhancing financial transparency in election campaigns.

190,Copilot,"The Philippines, known for its stunning landscapes and rich biodiversity, faces a growing environmental crisis: plastic pollution. As one of the world's top contributors to ocean plastic waste, the country grapples with the far-reaching consequences of plastic pollution on its ecosystems, public health, and economy. This editorial examines the causes and impact of plastic pollution in the Philippines, and outlines potential solutions to address this pressing issue.

Causes of Plastic Pollution

Overreliance on Single-Use Plastics: The widespread use of single-use plastics, such as plastic bags, straws, and sachets, is a significant contributor to plastic pollution in the Philippines. These items are convenient and inexpensive, but they are often discarded after a single use, leading to massive amounts of plastic waste.

Inadequate Waste Management: The country's waste management infrastructure struggles to keep pace with the growing volume of plastic waste. Many areas lack proper waste collection and disposal systems, resulting in plastic waste being improperly discarded in open dumpsites, rivers, and coastal areas. This waste eventually finds its way into the ocean, contributing to marine pollution.

Population Growth and Urbanization: Rapid population growth and urbanization have intensified the problem of plastic pollution. As cities expand and populations increase, so does the consumption of plastic products. The resulting plastic waste places additional strain on already inadequate waste management systems.

Lack of Awareness and Education: A lack of awareness and education about the environmental impact of plastic pollution contributes to the problem. Many Filipinos are not fully aware of the consequences of plastic waste on ecosystems and public health, leading to unsustainable consumption and disposal practices.

Impact of Plastic Pollution

Marine Ecosystems: The Philippines' marine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to plastic pollution. Marine species, including fish, sea turtles, and seabirds, often ingest or become entangled in plastic debris, leading to injury, starvation, and death. The degradation of coral reefs and other marine habitats further threatens biodiversity and the livelihoods of coastal communities that depend on fishing and tourism.

Public Health: Plastic pollution poses significant public health risks. Microplastics, tiny plastic particles that result from the breakdown of larger plastic items, can contaminate drinking water and enter the food chain. These microplastics can carry toxic chemicals, which may have harmful effects on human health. Additionally, the improper burning of plastic waste releases hazardous pollutants into the air, contributing to respiratory problems and other health issues.

Economic Impact: The economic impact of plastic pollution is substantial. The degradation of marine and coastal environments can harm the tourism industry, which is a vital source of income for many Filipinos. The fishing industry also suffers as plastic pollution disrupts marine ecosystems and reduces fish populations. Furthermore, the costs associated with cleaning up plastic waste and managing its environmental impact place a financial burden on local governments and communities.

191,Copilot,"The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, is a nation of stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. Despite the breathtaking landscapes and the vibrant mosaic of its peoples, the country grapples with a deeply ingrained issue: income inequality. This disparity in wealth distribution is not merely an economic problem but a social malady that hampers the nation's progress and the quality of life of millions of Filipinos.

The Roots of Inequality

To understand income inequality in the Philippines, one must look into the historical, socio-economic, and political factors that have shaped the nation's economic landscape. Colonial legacies, persistent poverty, and a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few elites have all contributed to the current state of affairs. The pre-colonial barangays, Spanish encomiendas, and American economic policies laid the groundwork for a society where wealth and power were heavily skewed towards a select group.

Fast forward to the present, and the economic structure has not fundamentally changed. Large conglomerates, often owned by powerful families, dominate key sectors such as real estate, manufacturing, and utilities. This concentration of economic power means that wealth is not evenly distributed, with a significant portion of the population struggling to make ends meet.

Impact on Society

The effects of income inequality are far-reaching. First and foremost, it exacerbates poverty. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, approximately 21% of Filipinos lived below the poverty line in 2018. Income inequality means that the benefits of economic growth are not shared equitably, leaving the poor with limited access to basic services such as education, healthcare, and housing.

Education, in particular, is a critical area affected by income inequality. While private schools and universities offer top-notch education, they are often beyond the reach of the average Filipino. Public schools, on the other hand, are plagued with issues such as overcrowded classrooms, lack of resources, and inadequate facilities. This educational divide perpetuates the cycle of poverty, as those who cannot afford quality education are less likely to secure well-paying jobs in the future.

Healthcare is another sector where income inequality rears its ugly head. Wealthier individuals can afford private healthcare, which offers better facilities and services. In contrast, the poor must rely on underfunded public hospitals and clinics, leading to disparities in health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted these inequalities, with access to testing, treatment, and vaccines being unequal across different socio-economic groups.

Government Policies and Challenges

Over the years, various administrations have attempted to address income inequality through different policies and programs. The implementation of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), a conditional cash transfer program, has helped provide financial assistance to the poorest households. The program aims to break the cycle of poverty by investing in health and education, but its impact has been limited by issues such as bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption.

Tax reform is another area where the government has made strides. The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, enacted in 2018, aimed to simplify the tax system and make it more equitable. While the law increased the take-home pay of many Filipinos, it also raised the prices of goods and services, disproportionately affecting the poor.

Despite these efforts, the challenge of income inequality remains daunting. Corruption, weak governance, and political dynasties hinder the effective implementation of policies aimed at reducing inequality. The concentration of power in the hands of a few elites means that policies often favor the wealthy, further entrenching the divide between the rich and the poor.

Moving Forward: Potential Solutions

Addressing income inequality in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach. First and foremost, there needs to be a focus on inclusive economic growth. This means creating an environment where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can thrive, providing more opportunities for employment and income generation. Supporting the agricultural sector, which employs a significant portion of the population, is also crucial. Investment in infrastructure, technology, and training can help farmers increase productivity and income.

Education reform is another critical area. Ensuring that every Filipino has access to quality education, regardless of their socio-economic background, is essential for breaking the cycle of poverty. This requires not only increasing funding for public schools but also addressing issues such as teacher training, curriculum development, and school facilities.

Healthcare reform is equally important. The implementation of the Universal Health Care (UHC) law in 2019 was a step in the right direction, aiming to provide all Filipinos with access to quality healthcare. However, the success of this law depends on proper funding, efficient implementation, and addressing systemic issues within the healthcare system.

Finally, addressing corruption and improving governance are essential for reducing income inequality. Transparent and accountable governance ensures that public funds are used effectively and that policies aimed at reducing inequality are implemented properly. Strengthening institutions, promoting the rule of law, and encouraging citizen participation in governance are all steps towards achieving this goal.

Conclusion

Income inequality is a complex and deeply rooted issue in the Philippines. It affects not only the economy but also the social fabric of the nation. Addressing this issue requires a holistic approach that includes inclusive economic growth, education and healthcare reform, and improved governance. While the challenge is immense, the potential rewards—a more equitable and prosperous society—make it a battle worth fighting. As Filipinos say, “Bayanihan,” or community spirit, can help the nation move forward together, leaving no one behind.",1

Many work in low-status jobs, such as domestic helpers, construction workers, and factory laborers, where they are vulnerable to abuse and unfair treatment2. Female OFWs, in particular, are disproportionately affected by these challenges, as they are more likely to experience gender-based discrimination and exploitation2.

The Philippine government has implemented various measures to protect the rights and welfare of OFWs. These include bilateral agreements with host countries, legal assistance, and support services provided by the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA). Despite these efforts, ensuring the safety and well-being of OFWs remains a complex and ongoing challenge.

The Role of OFWs in National Development
OFWs are not only economic contributors but also agents of national development. Their remittances support infrastructure projects, community programs, and local businesses, driving economic growth and development. Additionally, the skills and experiences gained by OFWs abroad can be valuable assets when they return to the Philippines, contributing to the country's human capital development.

The Philippine government recognizes the importance of OFWs and has implemented various programs to support their reintegration into society. These programs include skills training, entrepreneurship development, and financial literacy initiatives aimed at helping returning OFWs establish sustainable livelihoods and contribute to the local economy.

Conclusion
Overseas Filipino Workers are the backbone of the Philippine economy, providing essential financial support to their families and driving economic growth through their remittances. Their sacrifices and contributions are a testament to their resilience and dedication to improving the lives of their loved ones and the nation as a whole. While challenges remain, the continued support and protection of OFWs are crucial for ensuring their well-being and maximizing their positive impact on the Philippine economy and society.

As we celebrate the contributions of OFWs, it is essential to recognize their role as modern-day heroes and to continue advocating for their rights and welfare. By doing so, we can ensure that the legacy of OFWs as pillars of the Philippine economy endures for generations to come.",1

Youth participation in politics is not limited to voting. Many young Filipinos are actively involved in political campaigns, advocacy groups, and social movements. Organizations such as Youth Vote Philippines and the Kabataan Partylist have been instrumental in mobilizing the youth and advocating for their rights2. These groups focus on voter education, environmental protection, human rights, and other critical issues, demonstrating the diverse interests and concerns of the youth.

The Power of Social Media
Social media has emerged as a powerful tool for political engagement among the youth. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram provide young Filipinos with a space to express their opinions, share information, and organize collective actions. During the 2022 elections, social media played a pivotal role in shaping public discourse and mobilizing voters3.

The youth's adeptness at using digital platforms has allowed them to bypass traditional media channels and reach a broader audience. This has led to increased political awareness and participation, as young Filipinos use social media to hold politicians accountable, fact-check information, and advocate for transparency and good governance.

Challenges Faced by the Youth
Despite their growing influence, young Filipinos face several challenges in their political engagement. One of the primary obstacles is the prevalence of political dynasties and entrenched political elites. These powerful families often dominate local and national politics, making it difficult for new and young leaders to emerge4.

Additionally, the youth often encounter skepticism and resistance from older generations who may dismiss their views as naive or uninformed. This generational divide can hinder meaningful dialogue and collaboration between different age groups.

Economic barriers also play a significant role in limiting youth participation in politics. Many young Filipinos come from low-income families and must prioritize their education and livelihood over political involvement. The high cost of running for office and the lack of financial resources further discourage young candidates from pursuing political careers5.

The Role of Youth Organizations
Youth organizations play a crucial role in empowering young Filipinos and amplifying their voices in the political arena. These organizations provide platforms for the youth to engage in advocacy, leadership development, and community service. Notable youth organizations in the Philippines include:

Youth Vote Philippines: This organization promotes voter education and participation among young Filipinos. It conducts voter registration drives, organizes forums and debates, and provides information on the electoral process2.

Kabataan Partylist: A political party representing the interests of young people in the Philippine Congress. It advocates for education reform, youth employment, and human rights2.

Student Council Alliance of the Philippines: A federation of student councils that advocates for student rights and welfare. It provides a platform for student leaders to collaborate and address issues affecting the youth2.

Youth for Environmental Protection: An organization focused on environmental advocacy. It raises awareness about environmental issues and promotes sustainable practices among young Filipinos2.

The Potential for Change
The youth of the Philippines hold immense potential to drive meaningful change in the country's political landscape. Their energy, idealism, and innovative approaches can serve as catalysts for social and political transformation. By leveraging their collective power, young Filipinos can challenge the status quo, advocate for progressive policies, and hold leaders accountable.

To harness this potential, it is essential to create an enabling environment that supports youth participation in politics. This includes implementing policies that promote political inclusivity, providing financial support for young candidates, and fostering intergenerational dialogue and collaboration.

Conclusion
The youth of the Philippines are not just the leaders of tomorrow; they are the leaders of today. Their active participation in politics is crucial for building a more inclusive, transparent, and democratic society. By recognizing and supporting the contributions of young Filipinos, the nation can pave the way for a brighter and more equitable future.

As we look ahead, it is clear that the youth will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping Philippine politics. Their voices, actions, and aspirations will define the trajectory of the nation, ensuring that the Philippines remains a vibrant and dynamic democracy.",1
196,Copilot,"The concept of federalism has been a topic of significant debate in the Philippines for many years. As the nation grapples with issues of regional inequality, centralized governance, and inefficiencies in public administration, federalism is proposed as a potential solution to these longstanding challenges. This editorial explores the idea of federalism in the Philippine context, its potential benefits, challenges, and the steps needed to make it a reality.

Understanding Federalism
Federalism is a system of government where power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. In a federal system, these political units have significant autonomy and control over their own affairs, while the central government retains authority over national matters such as defense, foreign policy, and monetary policy1.

In the Philippines, the idea of federalism is not new. It was first suggested by national hero José Rizal in his essay ""Filipinas dentro de cien años"" (""The Philippines a Century Hence"") published in 18891. The concept gained further traction during the revolutionary period, with leaders like Emilio Aguinaldo and Apolinario Mabini advocating for a federal system to address the diverse needs of the archipelago1.

The Case for Federalism
Proponents of federalism argue that it can address several key issues facing the Philippines:

Decentralization of Power: One of the primary arguments for federalism is the decentralization of power. The current unitary system is highly centralized, with significant political and economic power concentrated in Metro Manila. This centralization has led to regional disparities, with wealth and development heavily skewed towards the capital2. Federalism would allow for a more equitable distribution of resources and decision-making authority, empowering local governments to address their unique needs and priorities.

Economic Development: By granting regions greater control over their own economic policies and resources, federalism can promote more balanced and inclusive economic development. Regions would have the autonomy to develop their own economic strategies, attract investments, and implement infrastructure projects tailored to their specific needs2. This could lead to increased economic activity and job creation in underdeveloped areas, reducing the economic divide between regions.

Improved Governance: Federalism can lead to improved governance by bringing government closer to the people. Local governments, being more attuned to the needs and concerns of their constituents, can provide more responsive and effective public services3. Additionally, federalism can foster healthy competition among regions, encouraging innovation and efficiency in governance.

Peace and Stability: In regions like Mindanao, where there are long-standing issues of conflict and insurgency, federalism is seen as a potential solution to address grievances and promote peace. By granting greater autonomy to regions with distinct cultural and historical identities, federalism can help address the root causes of conflict and foster a sense of inclusion and self-determination3.

Challenges and Concerns
While federalism offers several potential benefits, it also presents significant challenges and concerns:

Implementation Complexity: Transitioning to a federal system is a complex and challenging process. It requires significant constitutional amendments, the creation of new political and administrative structures, and the redistribution of powers and resources. Ensuring a smooth and effective transition would require careful planning, extensive consultations, and broad public support.

Risk of Inequality: There is a concern that federalism could exacerbate regional inequalities rather than alleviate them. Wealthier regions with more resources and economic opportunities may continue to prosper, while poorer regions may struggle to keep up. To address this, mechanisms for equitable resource distribution and financial support for less developed regions would need to be established.

Political Resistance: Federalism faces significant political resistance from various sectors, including entrenched political elites who may fear losing power and influence. Additionally, there are concerns that federalism could lead to political fragmentation and weaken national unity. Building consensus and addressing these concerns would be crucial for the successful implementation of federalism.

Public Awareness and Support: For federalism to succeed, it is essential to build public awareness and support. Many Filipinos may not fully understand the concept of federalism and its implications. Comprehensive information campaigns, public consultations, and educational initiatives would be necessary to engage the public and build a broad base of support.

Steps Towards Federalism
To move towards federalism, several key steps need to be taken:

Constitutional Amendments: The transition to a federal system would require significant amendments to the 1987 Constitution. This would involve a thorough review of the existing constitution, drafting of new provisions, and approval through a constitutional convention or constituent assembly.

Institutional Reforms: Establishing a federal system would require the creation of new political and administrative institutions at the regional level. This includes the establishment of regional governments, legislative bodies, and judicial systems. Ensuring that these institutions are transparent, accountable, and effective would be crucial for the success of federalism.

Capacity Building: Building the capacity of local governments to manage their own affairs is essential for federalism to work. This includes providing training and resources to local officials, improving local governance structures, and enhancing the delivery of public services.

Equitable Resource Distribution: Mechanisms for equitable resource distribution and financial support for less developed regions would need to be established. This includes creating a system of intergovernmental transfers, revenue-sharing arrangements, and development funds to ensure that all regions have the resources they need to thrive.

Public Engagement: Engaging the public in the federalism debate is crucial for building support and ensuring a smooth transition. This includes conducting public consultations, information campaigns, and educational initiatives to raise awareness and address concerns.

Conclusion
Federalism presents a promising path for addressing the longstanding issues of regional inequality, centralized governance, and inefficiencies in public administration in the Philippines. By decentralizing power, promoting economic development, improving governance, and fostering peace and stability, federalism has the potential to transform the nation's political landscape.

However, the transition to a federal system is not without challenges. It requires careful planning, extensive consultations, and broad public support. By addressing these challenges and taking the necessary steps towards federalism, the Philippines can build a more inclusive, equitable, and prosperous future for all its citizens.

As the nation continues to explore the possibility of federalism, it is essential to engage all stakeholders, including the youth, civil society, and political leaders, in the debate. By working together, the Philippines can pave the way for a brighter and more sustainable future under a federal system of government.",1
197,Copilot,"Election campaign financial transparency is a cornerstone of democratic governance. It ensures that elections are fair, candidates are accountable, and the public can trust the electoral process. In the Philippines, the issue of campaign finance transparency has been a subject of ongoing debate and reform. This editorial explores the current state of election campaign financial transparency in the Philippines, the challenges faced, and the steps needed to enhance transparency and accountability in the electoral process.

The Current State of Campaign Finance Transparency
The Philippines has established a legal framework to promote transparency in election campaign financing. Key laws and regulations include the Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881), Republic Act No. 7166, and various resolutions issued by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC)1. These laws require candidates, political parties, and contributors to disclose their financial activities related to election campaigns through the submission of Statements of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE).

The SOCE is a crucial document that provides a detailed account of all contributions received and expenditures made during the campaign period1. It includes information on cash and in-kind contributions, the sources of these contributions, and itemized expenses such as advertisements, rallies, and staff salaries. The SOCE must be submitted within 30 days after the election, and failure to comply can result in penalties, including fines and disqualification from holding public office1.

Challenges to Financial Transparency
Despite the legal framework in place, several challenges hinder the effective implementation of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines:

Inadequate Enforcement: One of the primary challenges is the inadequate enforcement of existing laws. While candidates and parties are required to submit their SOCEs, there are concerns about the accuracy and completeness of these reports. The COMELEC, responsible for overseeing compliance, often lacks the resources and capacity to thoroughly audit and verify the submitted documents2. This can lead to underreporting or misreporting of campaign finances.

Lack of Donor Transparency: Another significant issue is the lack of transparency regarding the sources of campaign contributions. While the law requires the disclosure of donor information, there are instances where contributions are made through intermediaries or shell organizations to obscure the true source2. This lack of transparency can lead to undue influence by wealthy individuals or special interest groups, undermining the integrity of the electoral process.

High Campaign Costs: The high cost of running for office in the Philippines exacerbates the challenges of campaign finance transparency. Candidates often rely on substantial financial support from donors, which can create opportunities for corruption and patronage3. The pressure to raise large sums of money can also lead candidates to engage in questionable fundraising practices.

Public Awareness and Engagement: Public awareness and engagement in campaign finance issues are relatively low. Many voters are not fully aware of the importance of financial transparency in elections or how to access and interpret SOCEs. This lack of awareness limits public scrutiny and accountability.

Steps to Enhance Financial Transparency
Addressing the challenges of campaign finance transparency requires a comprehensive approach that involves legal reforms, institutional strengthening, and public engagement. Here are some key steps that can be taken to enhance transparency and accountability in election campaign financing:

Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms: Enhancing the capacity of the COMELEC to enforce campaign finance laws is crucial. This includes providing adequate resources for auditing and verification of SOCEs, as well as implementing stricter penalties for non-compliance. Establishing an independent body to oversee campaign finance could also help ensure impartiality and effectiveness2.

Improving Donor Transparency: To address the issue of donor transparency, stricter regulations on the disclosure of contributions are needed. This includes requiring detailed information on the ultimate source of contributions and implementing measures to prevent the use of intermediaries or shell organizations. Public access to donor information should be facilitated to enable greater scrutiny2.

Regulating Campaign Spending: Implementing reasonable limits on campaign spending can help reduce the reliance on large donations and level the playing field for candidates. Recent legislative efforts, such as House Bill No. 8370, which proposes to increase the limits on authorized campaign spending, aim to reflect current economic realities while promoting transparency3. However, these limits must be accompanied by robust enforcement mechanisms to be effective.

Enhancing Public Awareness and Engagement: Increasing public awareness and engagement in campaign finance issues is essential for promoting transparency and accountability. This can be achieved through voter education campaigns, public forums, and the use of digital platforms to disseminate information on campaign finance. Encouraging media coverage and investigative journalism on campaign finance issues can also help raise awareness and promote accountability3.

Leveraging Technology: Utilizing technology can enhance transparency and accessibility of campaign finance information. Developing online platforms where SOCEs and donor information can be easily accessed and analyzed by the public can promote greater scrutiny and accountability. Additionally, implementing digital reporting systems can streamline the submission and auditing of campaign finance reports2.

Conclusion
Election campaign financial transparency is vital for ensuring the integrity of the electoral process and maintaining public trust in democratic institutions. While the Philippines has made progress in establishing a legal framework for campaign finance transparency, significant challenges remain. By strengthening enforcement mechanisms, improving donor transparency, regulating campaign spending, enhancing public awareness, and leveraging technology, the country can make meaningful strides towards a more transparent and accountable electoral system.

As the Philippines prepares for future elections, it is crucial to prioritize campaign finance transparency and address the challenges that undermine it. By doing so, the nation can build a more robust and inclusive democracy where the voices of all citizens are heard, and the influence of money in politics is minimized.",1
198,Copilot,"Mental health stigma remains a significant barrier to mental wellness in the Philippines. Despite recent progress, many Filipinos still face prejudice and discrimination when dealing with mental health issues. This editorial explores the roots of mental health stigma in the Philippines, its impact on individuals and society, and the steps needed to foster a more understanding and supportive environment.

The Roots of Mental Health Stigma
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is deeply rooted in cultural beliefs and social norms. Traditionally, mental illness has been viewed through a lens of judgment and misconception, leading to exclusion and discrimination1. Several factors contribute to this stigma:

Cultural Resilience: Filipinos pride themselves on their resilience and ability to endure hardships. This cultural trait, while admirable, often leads to the downplaying of mental health issues. Many Filipinos believe that mental health problems can be overcome through sheer willpower and that seeking help is a sign of weakness1.

Language and Terminology: The local language reflects the limitations in understanding mental health. Terms like ""baliw"" (crazy) are often used to describe a wide range of mental health conditions, perpetuating negative stereotypes and misconceptions1.

Lack of Public Health Education: There is a significant lack of public health education regarding mental health. Many Filipinos are not fully aware of the distinctions between different mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This lack of knowledge contributes to fear and misunderstanding1.

The Impact of Stigma
The stigma surrounding mental health has profound effects on individuals and society as a whole:

Barriers to Seeking Help: Stigma often prevents individuals from seeking the help they need. Fear of being judged or labeled as ""crazy"" can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating mental health conditions2. Many Filipinos choose to self-diagnose or ignore their symptoms, hoping they will go away on their own2.

Social Isolation: Individuals with mental health conditions often face social isolation and exclusion. They may be shunned by their communities, leading to feelings of loneliness and hopelessness. This isolation can worsen mental health conditions and hinder recovery2.

Economic Impact: Mental health stigma also has economic implications. Untreated mental health conditions can lead to decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher healthcare costs. The economic burden of mental health issues is significant, affecting not only individuals but also their families and communities3.

Progress and Legislative Efforts
Despite these challenges, there have been significant strides towards addressing mental health stigma in the Philippines. In 2018, the Mental Health Act (Republic Act No. 11036) was signed into law after nearly 20 years in Congress1. This landmark legislation affirms mental health as a basic human right and aims to integrate mental health services into the public health system.

The Mental Health Act mandates the establishment of mental health services at the community level, ensuring that mental health care is accessible to all Filipinos1. It also promotes mental health education and awareness programs to combat stigma and discrimination. The Department of Health (DOH) has recognized depression as a serious health condition, highlighting the need for comprehensive mental health care1.

Steps to Combat Mental Health Stigma
Addressing mental health stigma requires a multifaceted approach that involves education, advocacy, and community engagement. Here are some key steps that can help combat stigma and promote mental wellness:

Public Education Campaigns: Increasing public awareness and understanding of mental health is crucial. Public education campaigns can help dispel myths and misconceptions about mental health conditions. These campaigns should emphasize that mental health issues are common and treatable, and that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness1.

Mental Health Education in Schools: Integrating mental health education into school curricula can help foster a more supportive and understanding environment for young people. Teaching students about mental health, coping strategies, and how to seek help can reduce stigma and promote early intervention1.

Workplace Mental Health Programs: Employers can play a significant role in promoting mental wellness by implementing workplace mental health programs. These programs can provide employees with access to mental health resources, support services, and training on how to recognize and address mental health issues2.

Community Support Networks: Building strong community support networks can help individuals with mental health conditions feel less isolated. Community organizations, religious groups, and local leaders can provide support and advocacy for mental health initiatives2.

Media Representation: The media has a powerful influence on public perceptions of mental health. Promoting accurate and compassionate portrayals of mental health conditions in the media can help reduce stigma and encourage more open discussions about mental health3.

Conclusion
Mental health stigma remains a significant challenge in the Philippines, but progress is being made. By addressing the root causes of stigma and promoting education, advocacy, and community support, the nation can create a more understanding and supportive environment for individuals with mental health conditions.

The journey towards breaking the silence and addressing mental health stigma is not easy, but it is essential for the well-being and prosperity of the Filipino people. By working together, the government, private sector, and civil society can create a more inclusive and compassionate society where mental health is recognized as a vital component of overall health.

As we continue to push for change, it is crucial to remember that mental health is a shared responsibility. Each of us has a role to play in promoting mental wellness and combating stigma. By fostering a culture of acceptance and understanding, we can ensure that no one has to face mental health challenges alone.",1
199,Copilot,"The Philippines, a nation known for its vibrant culture and rapid economic growth, is facing significant challenges in urban congestion and housing shortages. As the population continues to grow and urbanize, these issues have become more pronounced, affecting the quality of life for millions of Filipinos. This editorial explores the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines.

The Causes of Urban Congestion
Urban congestion in the Philippines is a multifaceted problem with several contributing factors:

Rapid Urbanization: The Philippines has experienced rapid urbanization over the past few decades. Cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have seen significant population growth as people migrate from rural areas in search of better economic opportunities1. This influx of people has put immense pressure on urban infrastructure, leading to congestion.

Inadequate Public Transportation: The public transportation system in the Philippines is often inadequate and inefficient. Many Filipinos rely on jeepneys, buses, and tricycles, which are frequently overcrowded and poorly maintained2. The limited capacity and reliability of public transportation force many to use private vehicles, exacerbating traffic congestion.

Poor Urban Planning: Urban planning in the Philippines has not kept pace with the rapid growth of cities. Many urban areas lack proper zoning regulations and infrastructure development, leading to haphazard construction and inefficient land use2. This lack of planning contributes to traffic congestion and overcrowded living conditions.

Economic Disparities: Economic disparities also play a role in urban congestion. Many low-income families cannot afford to live near their workplaces and are forced to commute long distances. This daily migration of workers adds to the congestion on roads and public transportation systems2.

The Impact of Urban Congestion
The impact of urban congestion on the Philippines is far-reaching and affects various aspects of daily life:

Economic Costs: Traffic congestion leads to significant economic costs. According to a study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), traffic congestion in Metro Manila alone costs the economy approximately PHP 3.5 billion daily due to lost productivity and increased fuel consumption3. These costs are expected to rise if the issue is not addressed.

Environmental Degradation: The high volume of vehicles on the road contributes to air pollution and environmental degradation. Emissions from cars, buses, and jeepneys release harmful pollutants into the air, affecting public health and contributing to climate change3.

Reduced Quality of Life: Urban congestion reduces the quality of life for many Filipinos. Long commutes, traffic jams, and overcrowded public transportation systems lead to stress, fatigue, and decreased time for family and leisure activities3. The constant struggle with traffic also affects mental health and overall well-being.

The Housing Shortage Crisis
In addition to urban congestion, the Philippines is grappling with a severe housing shortage. The country faces a housing deficit of approximately 6.5 million units, a number projected to balloon to 22 million by 2040 if left unaddressed4. Several factors contribute to this crisis:

Rapid Population Growth: The Philippines has one of the highest population growth rates in Southeast Asia. The increasing population puts pressure on housing supplies, particularly in urban areas where many Filipinos flock for job opportunities4.

High Land and Construction Costs: The high cost of land and construction materials makes it difficult to develop affordable housing. Many developers focus on high-end residential projects, leaving low-income families with limited options4. The lack of affordable housing forces many to live in informal settlements or substandard conditions.

Bureaucratic Hurdles: The process of acquiring permits and approvals for housing projects is often slow and cumbersome. Bureaucratic red tape and corruption can delay construction and increase costs, deterring private investment in low-cost housing4.

Informal Settlements: A significant portion of the population lives in informal settlements, often in high-risk areas like riverbanks and steep slopes. These settlements lack basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity, exacerbating the housing crisis4.

The Impact of Housing Shortages
The housing shortage crisis has profound implications for individuals and society:

Increased Poverty: The lack of affordable housing contributes to increased poverty and inequality. Many low-income families spend a significant portion of their income on rent, leaving little for other essential needs such as food, education, and healthcare5.

Health and Safety Risks: Living in substandard housing or informal settlements poses significant health and safety risks. Poor living conditions can lead to the spread of diseases, while the lack of proper infrastructure increases vulnerability to natural disasters5.

Social Unrest: The housing crisis can lead to social unrest and instability. The growing gap between affluent homeowners and the underprivileged can fuel tensions and contribute to political instability5.

Potential Solutions
Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach. Here are some potential solutions:

Improving Public Transportation: Investing in efficient and reliable public transportation systems is crucial for reducing urban congestion. Expanding and modernizing the existing network of buses, trains, and jeepneys can provide commuters with viable alternatives to private vehicles2. Implementing policies that promote the use of public transportation, such as dedicated bus lanes and affordable fares, can also help alleviate congestion.

Enhancing Urban Planning: Effective urban planning is essential for managing population growth and ensuring sustainable development. Implementing zoning regulations, developing green spaces, and promoting mixed-use developments can create more livable and efficient urban areas2. Encouraging the construction of high-density housing near employment centers can reduce the need for long commutes.

Affordable Housing Initiatives: The government must prioritize affordable housing initiatives to address the housing shortage crisis. Programs such as the Pambansang Pabahay Para sa Pilipino (4PH) aim to construct 1 million housing units annually until 20284. Providing subsidies, reducing loan interest rates, and offering incentives to private developers can make housing more accessible to low-income families.

Streamlining Bureaucratic Processes: Simplifying and streamlining the process of acquiring permits and approvals for housing projects can encourage private investment in low-cost housing. Reducing bureaucratic red tape and combating corruption can expedite construction and development4.

Community Engagement and Support: Engaging communities in the planning and implementation of housing projects can ensure that their needs and preferences are considered. Providing support services such as skills training, livelihood programs, and access to basic services can help improve the living conditions of informal settlers5.

Conclusion
Urban congestion and housing shortages are pressing issues that require immediate and effective solutions. By addressing the root causes and implementing comprehensive strategies, the Philippines can create more livable, sustainable, and inclusive urban environments. The journey towards resolving these challenges is complex, but with coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and civil society, a brighter future is within reach for all Filipinos.",1
200,Copilot,"Plastic pollution is a pressing environmental issue that has reached alarming levels globally, and the Philippines is at the forefront of this crisis. As one of the world's largest contributors to ocean plastic waste, the Philippines faces significant challenges in managing plastic pollution. This editorial explores the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to the plastic pollution problem in the Philippines, highlighting the urgent need for collective action.

The Scale of the Problem
The Philippines generates over 2.7 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, with approximately 20% of this waste entering the ocean1. This staggering figure makes the Philippines the world's top ocean plastic polluter, contributing nearly three times more plastic waste to the oceans than the second-closest country1. The country's rivers, particularly the Pasig River, are major conduits for plastic waste, with seven of the world's top 10 plastic-polluting rivers located in the Philippines1.

Causes of Plastic Pollution
Several factors contribute to the severe plastic pollution problem in the Philippines:

Urban Runoff and Improper Waste Disposal: A significant portion of plastic waste is generated by households and businesses in metropolitan areas like Manila. Urban runoff, combined with improper waste disposal practices, leads to large amounts of plastic waste entering waterways and eventually the ocean1.

Inadequate Waste Management Infrastructure: The waste management infrastructure in the Philippines is often insufficient to handle the volume of waste generated. Only about 33% of the country's waste is managed correctly through collection and disposal, while the rest ends up in landfills or the ocean1. The lack of sanitary landfills and strict regulations on building new ones exacerbate the problem2.

Single-Use Plastics: The widespread use of single-use plastics, such as plastic bags, straws, and packaging, contributes significantly to plastic pollution. These items are often discarded after a single use and are not biodegradable, leading to long-term environmental damage2.

Economic and Social Factors: Economic disparities and lack of public awareness also play a role in plastic pollution. Many low-income communities lack access to proper waste disposal facilities and are more likely to dispose of waste improperly2. Additionally, there is a need for greater public education on the environmental impact of plastic waste and the importance of proper waste management.

Impacts of Plastic Pollution
The impacts of plastic pollution in the Philippines are far-reaching and affect both the environment and human health:

Environmental Degradation: Plastic pollution poses a dire threat to marine ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion, starvation, and death1. Mangrove forests and coral reefs, which are critical for coastal protection and marine biodiversity, are increasingly filled with plastic waste, reducing their ability to support marine life and protect against erosion1.

Economic Costs: Plastic pollution has significant economic implications, particularly for coastal communities that rely on fishing and tourism. The presence of plastic waste on beaches and in the water can lead to reduced fish stocks and a decline in tourism, both of which are critical sources of income for these communities1.

Human Health Risks: Plastic pollution also poses health risks to humans. Microplastics, which are tiny plastic particles that result from the breakdown of larger plastic items, can enter the food chain and be ingested by humans. The long-term health effects of microplastic ingestion are still being studied, but there is growing concern about their potential impact on human health1.

Legislative and Policy Efforts
In response to the growing plastic pollution crisis, the Philippine government has taken several legislative and policy measures:

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Law: In 2023, the Philippines passed the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) law, which requires businesses with assets worth over ₱100 million to take responsibility for the plastic waste they produce3. This law mandates that companies implement measures to reduce, recover, and recycle plastic waste, promoting a circular economy approach.

Plastic Bag Bans and Regulations: Several local government units (LGUs) have implemented bans or regulations on single-use plastics, such as plastic bags and straws3. These measures aim to reduce the consumption of single-use plastics and encourage the use of reusable alternatives.

Waste Management Programs: The government has also launched various waste management programs to improve waste collection, recycling, and disposal. These programs include public awareness campaigns, community-based waste management initiatives, and partnerships with private sector organizations3.

Potential Solutions
Addressing plastic pollution in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach. Here are some potential solutions:

Strengthening Waste Management Infrastructure: Investing in waste management infrastructure is crucial for reducing plastic pollution. This includes building more sanitary landfills, improving waste collection systems, and developing recycling facilities2. Public-private partnerships can play a key role in financing and implementing these infrastructure projects.

Promoting a Circular Economy: Transitioning to a circular economy, where products are designed to be reused, repaired, and recycled, can significantly reduce plastic waste. Encouraging businesses to adopt sustainable practices and consumers to choose eco-friendly products can help promote a circular economy2.

Enhancing Public Education and Awareness: Increasing public awareness about the environmental impact of plastic pollution and the importance of proper waste management is essential. Public education campaigns, school programs, and community outreach initiatives can help change behaviors and promote responsible waste disposal2.

Supporting Innovation and Research: Investing in research and innovation can lead to the development of new technologies and materials that reduce plastic waste. This includes biodegradable plastics, advanced recycling methods, and waste-to-energy technologies3.

Strengthening Legislation and Enforcement: Strengthening existing laws and regulations on plastic waste management and ensuring their effective enforcement is crucial. This includes imposing stricter penalties for non-compliance and providing incentives for businesses that adopt sustainable practices3.

Conclusion
Plastic pollution is a critical environmental issue that requires urgent action. The Philippines, as one of the world's largest contributors to ocean plastic waste, has a responsibility to address this crisis. By strengthening waste management infrastructure, promoting a circular economy, enhancing public education, supporting innovation, and strengthening legislation, the Philippines can make significant strides towards reducing plastic pollution and protecting its environment.

The journey towards a plastic-free Philippines is challenging, but it is essential for the well-being of the environment and future generations.

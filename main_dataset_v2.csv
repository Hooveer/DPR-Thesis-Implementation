1,John Nery,"The success of the Marcos-Duterte electoral alliance in 2022 was so massive it could be said that the political equivalent of Newton’s law of inertia applied to it. A body moving at constant speed in a straight line will continue moving at constant speed in a straight line unless a force acted upon it. The alliance – if all went well, if the different parts moved at the same speed and kept to the same line – had a lock on the 2028 presidential election, which in our part of the universe determines other political possibilities. And then a force acted upon it. Now the alliance has descended into a war of the dynasties, between the Marcoses and the Dutertes, and an opening is starting to form, not necessarily for the political opposition but perhaps for a political third force led by someone like the populist, and popular, Senator Raffy Tulfo.But the reality of politics has always been messy; perhaps Newton’s laws of motion cannot really explain it. For some analysts, the break between the Marcoses and the Dutertes was inevitable; inertia was never an explanation. But some politicians believed in the alliance, and continue to do so even in the middle of the dynastic war; the law of action and reaction governs their pragmatic attempts to end it. Another way to look at the political situation today, to understand the “chaos” affecting the political class, is to borrow the theory at the heart of the popular Netflix series, 3-Body Problem, based on Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem trilogy. What is the three-body problem? The character Wang Miao explains: “It’s actually pretty simple. The reason why the sun’s motion seems patternless is because our world has three suns. Under the influence of their mutually perturbing gravitational attraction, their movements are unpredictable – the three-body problem. When our planet revolves around one of the suns in a stable orbit, that’s a Stable Era. When one or more of the other suns move within a certain distance, their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it’s orbiting, causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns. That’s a Chaotic Era. After an uncertain amount of time, our planet is once again pulled into a temporary orbit and another Stable Era begins. This is a football game at the scale of the universe. The players are the three suns, and our planet is the football.” (This excerpt is of course from the Ken Liu translation.) The three suns in the second Marcos administration are President Marcos, his older sister Senator Imee Marcos, and his cousin Speaker Martin Romualdez. We can measure their gravitational pull on the planet of Philippine politics according to three factors: the scale of rehabilitation of the Marcos legacy and name, the question of presidential succession, and the choice of primary geopolitical partner. There must be other criteria, but I suggest that these three form the core. These describe their hold on their moons, account for the difference in their orbits – and explain why the Stable Era promised by the UniTeam’s unprecedented victory has deteriorated into a Chaotic Era. Marcos legacy. I think that President Marcos understands his election in 2022 as a completion of the task his family imposed on him since at least 1995, the first time he ran for national office; he has rehabilitated the Marcos name simply by winning the office his father held for 20 years. His election created the minimum condition of rehabilitation – that the public regard his father no longer as a dictator but as “just another” president, the first Marcos – and I think he is happy to claim the win. Senator Marcos’s definition of rehabilitation is much broader. She wants public opinion to reflect how she thinks of her father, as a great man wronged by history. She wants to restore her father to an imagined gallery of greatness, and this requires nothing less than a repudiation of the Edsa People Power uprising. (On rereading, I see that my July 2022 column “The four REs of the Marcos restoration” actually tracks Imee’s position more closely than her brother’s.) For Imee, it is not enough for the first Marcos to be seen as just another president. Speaker Romualdez’s idea of rehabilitation is just as expansive, but in a different direction. He expects it to cover not only the Marcoses but the Romualdezes too. For him, the true measure of rehabilitation is if another member of their extended family succeeds his cousin. His reading has disturbed others in the political class, even those who warmly welcomed the return of the Marcoses to Malacañang, because it unnecessarily tests the boundaries of political power. One may be willing to concede power to a family for six years, but 12? Presidential Succession. Marcos continues to keep his personal relationship with his vice president warm, even in the face of outright hostility and insolent language from his predecessor the former president and the two Duterte sons. I think he is pragmatic enough to accept a Duterte as a successor, if that is the way his political interests lie; at the same time, he cannot but be open to a Romualdez or a Tulfo, for the same reason. But it seems clear that his influential wife’s counsel is what he will keep. This sub-factor is a particular sticking point with other members of the political class, especially the Dutertes. Imee Marcos was one of Rodrigo Duterte’s original supporters in his long-shot campaign for the presidency in 2016, and was instrumental in convincing Duterte’s more popular daughter Sara to run as Bongbong Marcos’s running mate in 2022. As I see it, she wants her family to honor the explicit or implied agreement with the Dutertes that made the UniTeam tandem possible in the first place: Support Sara for president in 2028. While her definition of political rehabilitation is maximalist, her understanding of the dynamic of presidential elections is much more pragmatic. She sees Sara as still the candidate to beat in 2028 AND also the president who can consolidate the gains of the Marcoses best. From all indications, Speaker Romualdez wants to become the next president. He may still run for a third term as representative of the 1st District of Leyte next year, but his long-term strategy may likely involve a Senate run in 2025. A strong showing would place him in strong contention for 2028. (See Gloria Arroyo in 1995, or Grace Poe in 2013.) The ongoing campaign to raise his profile in different congressional districts is an expensive signal; to give only one example, the constituency-serving facility set up on Kamuning Street in Quezon City, while ostensibly an alliance between the district representative and his wife Yedda Romualdez’s Tingog party-list group, features only one larger-than-life image: his. Superpower Ally. Before Marcos came to power, I thought he would continue moving in the direction set by President Duterte’s pivot to China; his family’s historical ties with Chinese leadership weighed heavily in my estimate. Instead, he has firmly redirected Philippine foreign policy back to Washington DC and the Western alliance. This must stem in part from the recognition that there is an international aspect to the project of rehabilitation; in his view, the course of cleaning up the family name runs through key Western capitals. Senator Marcos would favor a return to the Duterte China-first policy. The language she used in presenting her seven-point plan in September 2022 as Senate foreign affairs committee chair speaks of “engagement” with Beijing, but her remarks since then suggest collaboration rather than engagement, to the extent that today she is seen as the principal non-Duterte defender of China. (She resents this perception.) Romualdez has controversially accompanied the President on many of his foreign travels, in part to assert his idea of “legislative diplomacy” and his ideal of Congress as a full partner of the Executive in foreign policy. But he shares the pro-Western view of his cousin, Ambassador to the United States Babe Romualdez; donated $2 million to fund a Tagalog course in Harvard University; has consistently supported the strengthening of Philippine-American ties. As president, he would likely deepen the Philippine partnership with the United States. Chaotic era. In the last two years, the three suns have each increased in mass. Romualdez’s Lakas-CMD is now the largest single party in Congress, and he has proved that he can make Congress jump through hoops. Imee has reinforced her ties with the Dutertes, who have been welcoming former allies (such as former Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez) back into the fold; at the same time, she has leaned into her role as a dependable source, “good copy,” for the media. The President remains buoyed both by constant travel and the warm welcome of Western allies; the scope of influence of his wife Lisa Araneta Marcos has also widened. As a result, their “mutually perturbing gravitational attraction ” has also grown. The turmoil within the ruling coalition includes many celestial anomalies: a stealthy two-pronged campaign to change the Constitution; open conflict between the Senate and the House; a tightening of the net around key Duterte allies; the suddenly more substantial shadow of the International Criminal Court looming from The Hague; even more aggressive interventions by Beijing in the West Philippine Sea; ever closer ties with Washington, Tokyo, Canberra, London. All this instability can be explained simply. There are three competing centers of gravity within the extended Marcos family.",0
2,John Nery,"The war on Ninoy Aquino’s legacy is a fight the political opposition should welcome, and win. It wasn’t a surprise, but for many who recognize Ninoy Aquino’s heroism, the orchestrated attacks on his legacy on the anniversary of his assassination, subverting the very meaning of his martyrdom, still came as a shock. Maybe it was the brazenness of the deceitful counterclaims, or maybe it was the sheer scale of the networked campaign, or maybe it was the sinking sense that a new nightmare in disinformation and historical denialism had begun – but the blow that shocked many into a defensive crouch was visceral, real. Can all of that history really be denied? The fact that he was killed by Marcos’s soldiers, the fact that millions of people turned out for his funeral, the fact that his sacrifice galvanized the opposition, the fact that his death in 1983 led to the end of the Marcos regime in 1986: Can all of that be deliberately forgotten, or reinterpreted, or hashtagged away? Marcos and Duterte allies are certainly trying. The groundwork had been laid during the Duterte years, when legislation to change the name of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, the country’s main gateway, was first filed. Alarms over the possible removal of the image of Aquino on the P500 bill (part of the design since 1987) and that of his wife, the late president Cory Aquino (included in the design in 2010), were also first raised under the Duterte administration, when the Bangko Sentral initiated a new currency series that replaced heroes with Philippine flora and fauna. But the anti-Ninoy campaign grew in volume and viciousness after Ferdinand Marcos Jr. won the presidency. One of the first bills filed in the 19th Congress sought the renaming of the airport from Aquino to the man with final responsibility for his assassination, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos himself, on the mistaken assumption that Marcos built the airport. A day before the 39th anniversary of the assassination, a handful of police accounts on social media used the hashtags #NinoyNotHero (sic) and #NinoyNPA in bizarre posts that were later taken down. And on the day of the anniversary, the coordinated smear campaign against Aquino erupted into full view: He was denounced as a traitor, tagged as a communist, blamed as a destabilizer or a chaos-maker. And though the August 21 anniversary (which fell on a Sunday this year) remained a national holiday, the main institutions of government kept silent. No statements were issued. In his first State of the Nation Address the previous month, President Marcos Jr. deliberately avoided mentioning Aquino’s name; he spoke of creating “more international airports to help decongest the bottleneck in the Manila Airport.” The policy of official silence on the anniversary, then, was all of a piece.To be sure, Marcos issued Proclamation No. 42 the day after Ninoy Aquino Day, listing the official holidays for 2023; both August 21 and February 25, the anniversary of the People Power revolution that drove the Marcoses from Malacañang, were still on the list. As I wrote before, I expect it will take him three years to finally drop the two holidays.  But I could be wrong. Of the factions in the ruling coalition, there is at least one that is maximalist; it seeks to rehabilitate the father AND degrade the father’s political archrival as quickly as possible. Republic Act 9256, which declared Aquino’s death anniversary a holiday, can be repealed within a matter of months. Coalition Objectives. Why the zeal to erase Ninoy Aquino from history? Most of the parties and factions that comprise the ruling coalition, with the possible exception of the marginalized Arroyo group, are invested in reinterpreting mainstream Philippine history because a national narrative that celebrates Aquino as hero is necessarily a narrative that assumes Marcos as villain. The dictator was gravely ill on the day Aquino was killed; it is very likely that while he approved his wife Imelda’s repeated attempts to warn Aquino against coming back because of the risk of assassination, he did not directly order the killing. He must have anticipated, if not the scale, then at least the kind, of consequences you reap when you turn your rival into a martyr. But Marcos did arrest Aquino when Martial Law took effect; he did imprison Aquino for seven years on made-up charges; he did allow a military court to try, and eventually, convict, a civilian defendant; he did install a dictatorship that denied Filipinos their basic freedoms; he did create the conditions that by the early 1980s had pushed the country to the brink of social upheaval; he did manufacture a subservient military that produced the soldiers who killed Aquino. Marcos bears final responsibility for Aquino’s sprawled corpse on the airport tarmac. That that airport has borne Aquino’s name since December 1987 (through a law that was enacted without the approval of his widow, the president at that time) is a continuing reminder of that ultimate responsibility. That is why President Marcos Jr. couldn’t even say the airport’s full name; his father and his family are implicated every time the name is invoked. The Marcoses have apparently forgiven the late president Fidel Ramos for his crucial role in their ouster; they have not only forgiven their father’s defense secretary, Juan Ponce Enrile, for defecting from the Marcos regime, they have welcomed him into the official family as chief presidential legal counsel. The truth is that many of those who made the EDSA revolution happen have found ways to work with the Marcoses when they returned to political office. In that sense, EDSA as historical event is easier for the Marcos family to live with, or live down. But the Aquinos are a different matter. Ninoy Aquino and his ragtag Lakas ng Bayan party had humiliated Imelda Marcos during the 1978 Interim Batasang Pambansa elections. Aquino had repeatedly rejected Imelda’s many warnings about not coming home. He could have stayed in comfortable exile in the United States, but decided (exactly like Jose Rizal) to return home to almost certain death. That decision led to the collapse of the Marcos regime, and cemented Marcos’ historical reputation, not as the enlightened strongman he believed he was, but as the brutal dictator the assassination revealed him to be. To rehabilitate Marcos’s name and legacy, Aquino’s role in history must be degraded and denied. Opposition Opportunity. It is instructive to remember that when rumors of Aquino’s impending return circulated in 1983, the Marcos-controlled press (in an amazing display of editorial synchronicity) began printing unflattering, previously published stories about the opposition leader. Aquino before his arrest in 1972 was an easy target: rich, glib, flashy young man on the make, surrounded by bodyguards. The stories showed a man of great privilege and even greater ambition. The current campaign against him draws on this portrait – and then adds a layer of outright fabrication. The new script includes old allegations: that he was a communist (or even a founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines); that his absence during the Plaza Miranda bombing of 1971, which was aimed at his fellow Liberal Party members, proved that he was behind the act of terrorism; that he had been naturalized as a Malaysian citizen, and so on. But like Rizal, we remember Aquino because of the last 10 years of his life: seven years in prison and three years in exile changed him, we might even say purified him, and prepared him to be, in the final moment of his life, a hero. I was at that massive funeral for Aquino on August 31, 1983 – 10 years ago on Wednesday. I was one of maybe two million, maybe even three million, who escorted him to his grave. It was the largest funeral in Philippine history, and one of the largest in the world. I was also at EDSA in February 1986, when as many as four million Filipinos thronged the streets. And I was one of the 16.6 million who voted for the 1987 Constitution: an astonishing 77% of all votes cast. I believed then, and I believe now, that all those millions saw Aquino’s sacrifice as a martyrdom, and Aquino as a hero. The bracing thing: Lots of proof exist that Filipinos see Aquino as a hero. Many of the millions who turned out for his funeral or flocked to EDSA and other urban centers elsewhere in the country are still alive; many archives are accessible and easy to use. In other words, the question whether Aquino is a hero, which Marcos and Duterte allies have seeded, is actually a contest that the political opposition should join willingly, because it is winnable. In its present state, the opposition is defensive by default. The war to define Aquino’s heroic legacy, centered on the principle that the Filipino is worth dying for, is an opportunity to go on the offense, to convert hearts and minds, to speak truth with power.

3,John Nery,"One of many lessons from the ongoing Twitter fiasco: Billionaires make up, and bankers believe, all kinds of bullshit. To buy Twitter, Elon Musk had to pay not only the $44-billion acquisition price but also what are called closing costs. The total amount was substantially higher: $46.5 billion. A consortium of major banks, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and Bank of America, provided Musk with almost $13 billion in debt financing. In other words, aside from putting up his own money (largely by selling Tesla stock) and convincing investment funds to take a stake, Musk had to take out a loan. At around the time the acquisition was completed, at the end of October, the banks were already looking at a potential loss of half a billion dollars if they had sold their debt then. Now, according to a Reuters report based on a Financial Times story, the banks are looking to hold on to their debt (that is, not sell them off), having “conceded they will be stuck holding the debt on their books for months or even longer and will probably end up incurring huge losses on the financing package.” Question: How was it possible that ostensibly responsible bankers approved a multi-billion-dollar loan that started losing value the moment the loan was cleared? For ordinary people like you and me, these sums are unreal. Is there any difference between $1 billion and $13 billion, or $44 billion, for the proverbial man or woman on the street? But we presume that bankers (and investors, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs) appreciate the true weight of money. Why then did these bankers back a businessman who did not in fact want to proceed with the acquisition and had to be forced by litigation to complete the purchase? Magical thinking. The answer must lie in a form of collective magical thinking: These bankers and investors believed in Musk, despite the lack of substance in and even the absurdity of his plans for improving Twitter’s business prospects. Last May, the New York Times obtained a copy of the presentation slides – the pitch deck – that Musk used to court investor support for buying Twitter. He projected that from a base of around 7,500 employees, the Twitter workforce would grow to 9,225 this year and to 11,072 in 2025. And yet one of the first things Musk did when he took over Twitter was to fire half of the staff. Over 1,200 more employees resigned after he set a deadline. How can Musk possibly make good on his other grandiose plans for Twitter? He has less than a third of the work force he said needed to be in place by this year. And it’s not as if Musk’s drastic moves were a surprise. His track record at Tesla, the electric-vehicle manufacturer, and at SpaceX, the rocket business, should have warned  bankers and investors that self-created chaos was his playbook. Musk “clearly thrives in existential circumstances,” a former Tesla engineer told the Times. Musk told investors that by 2028 he would grow Twitter’s user base from 217 million in 2021 to 931 million; transform the platform’s payments business from a projected and paltry $15 million in 2023 to about $1.3 billion; and raise company revenue from $5 billion in 2021 to $26.4 billion. These numbers are literally incredible: hard to believe, or even credit. This is the business bullshit that the bankers bought? This is the BS that magical thinking sold. Never mind the Qatari or Saudi investors, who may only need to answer to their sovereigns, but what about the suits in Morgan Stanley, who agreed to loan Musk about $3.5 billion? Do they still have a job? Market mentality. I suppose the answer here is the other side of Musk’s track record; bankers and investors can point to his success at Tesla and at SpaceX. But the free market these capitalists supposedly believe in has in fact been driving down the value of Tesla for a year already. Just last Monday, Bloomberg reported that Musk’s net worth shrank by $8.6 billion. He lost more wealth in one day than the entire fortune of the single richest person in the Philippines, Manny Villar. In the first 11 months of the year, Musk’s net worth fell by an astonishing $100.5 billion – equivalent to about one-fourth of the Philippine GNP. The scale is staggering in itself, but the losses are something else. The cause is clear enough. Fortune magazine noted that since November 2021, when Musk’s wealth was at its peak, “Tesla’s stock has fallen more than 59% as growing recession fears, slowing EV demand, and Musk’s Twitter acquisition have weighed on investors’ confidence.” Tesla is the main source of Musk’s wealth. Aside from internal problems (the most recent recall involved 300,000 cars with a factory defect) and economic difficulties (more expensive raw material, more restrictive China market), Tesla also has to contend with Musk’s new acquisition, Twitter. Some investors “worry that Tesla’s strategy may fall to the wayside” (Fortune); other investors fear that “the billionaire is spreading himself too thin” (Bloomberg). But the real problem is that, in late capitalism, billionaires can lay it on too thick—and bankers, investors, venture capitalists are only too willing, too gullible, to believe them. ",0
4,John Nery,"Of course we all need to be particular about the source of the funds. That is the most important issue. As if to demonstrate the great decline in stature from chief justice of the Supreme Court to ad interim executive secretary and thus temporary chief aide, Lucas Bersamin spent a lot of time in his first press briefing on Tuesday, October 4, offering ridiculous rationalizations for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s weekend getaway to Singapore. The former chief justice did not act at all like a circumspect judge, conscious of the responsibility all public officials bear toward public office. The new executive secretary also did not act any different from the old one, who was accused (even by supporters of President Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte) of a high-handedness born of sheer proximity to power. Instead, Executive Secretary Bersamin made assertions to justify the President’s junket that even law students would have readily picked apart. He prefaced his remarks by saying that he did not have “direct knowledge” of how the President’s trip to Singapore to catch the Formula 1 race was funded. If he was reciting in class, his professor would have ripped this admission wide open. He must have known he would be asked about the Singapore trip; why didn’t he prepare beforehand by determining the source of the funding? Either he was lazy, or unprepared, or irresponsibly incurious. It’s also possible that he made the admission as a way to distance himself from the issue, an attempt to put his answers on less authoritative ground. If he did in fact make that bet, the headlines and stories in the wake of his press briefing show that he wagered wrong. But his admission was merely laying the predicate for his first rationalization: “You don’t need to be too particular about where the funds were sourced.” This is atrocious nonsense, based on the unsaid but false assumption that the President is exempt from standards applied to other public officials. In fact, Bersamin tried to justify this nonsense by referring, broadly, to the implied deference the Administrative Code of 1987 pays, or so he says, to the entire First Family. But nothing in the same Code, or indeed in any other law, says that the basic principle that “public office is a public trust” does not hold for the President and the First Family. Of course we all need to be particular about the source of the funds. That is the most important issue (but, significantly, not the only one). The distinction between the private person and the public official is a measure of political modernity; we no longer make the mistake of thinking that the office is the man. If President Marcos incurs an expense in his private capacity – for instance, buying a ticket to an Eric Clapton concert, or indulging an addiction to nicotine – he must pay for it out of his own pocket. That’s what his salary is for; that’s where his family’s private wealth, the subject of unending litigation, comes in. To say, blithely, as Bersamin did, that the source of funding is “irrelevant,” is to do violence to the constitutional principle of accountability. Bersamin suggested that even he could have paid for the President’s travel, if only he had the money, and it would have been okay. Again, arrant and dangerous nonsense.  If, to follow his own example, he did pay for the President’s trip, then he should be ready to stand accused of buying his new position. Private time. Bersamin’s second rationalization was that the President was on “private time.” He said: “It’s not immodest, it’s not contrary to morals, private time ‘yan.” He was preemptively answering possible ethical questions that could be raised against the President based on principles enshrined in the Constitution and the laws, but he was only indulging in a non-sequitur. Just because an official does something on private time, it doesn’t mean that what he does is necessarily modest, or not contrary to morals. “Private time” doesn’t cover a multitude of sins. And even if, to borrow Bersamin’s own strained metaphor, Marcos Junior had become a “matinee idol” whose very presence at the race added “some suspense and intrigue and some importance to that event,” that new-found celebrity still would not protect the President if he were to commit a crime or a scandal during his own private time. But in fact Bersamin used the private time argument in bad faith, because he had a third rationalization that ran opposite the second. The President, the former justice said, “was still performing his job as President when he was abroad, although that is not an official state visit.” It is easy enough to see how vapid this reasoning is, when you apply it to actual and specific examples. When Marcos watched the Clapton concert, was he still performing his job as President? When he spent hours soaking in the expensive atmosphere of an F1 race, was he doing so as part of his presidential duties? Questions like these are why Bersamin offered the private time argument, but as chief aide he thought it was necessary to add the exact opposite argument, just to cover all the bases. What a disgrace. But he didn’t stop there. To try to deflect public outrage over the President’s insensitive partying in Singapore, at a time when many had not yet recovered from the last typhoon, Bersamin said it was the criticism of the President’s visit that was insensitive. “Yun ang insensitive, yung criticism.” When an avatar of the rule of law is the first to attack the public’s inherent right to criticize erring public officials, he has lost his bearings and has no business serving in government. The irony is that he even thought his own person could serve as the clincher to the argument that the source of funding was irrelevant. But it didn’t – because there was nothing there.",0
5,John Nery,"In 'Some People Need Killing,' the acclaimed journalist's searing, searching account of Rodrigo Duterte’s calamitous 'war on drugs,' we come face to face with the enormity of evil – and the language that enables it. Rodrigo Duterte was the only candidate for Philippine president who promised to kill thousands of his potential voters to solve what he called a drug crisis; he would fill Manila Bay with the corpses of as many as a hundred thousand drug addicts, he said. Once voted into office, he made good on that promise. Some People Need Killing, the journalist Patricia Evangelista’s much-anticipated account of Duterte’s promised war on drugs, includes in its breadth of detail and casualty count and dramatic incident some of those very Duterte voters who ended up killed in Duterte’s war. There is even an entire chapter on Duterte supporters consumed by regret. This may have been an effort on Evangelista’s part to end her harrowing, thoughtful, absorbing account on a less bleak note, but she is above all else a reporter, and her faithful reporting does not sugarcoat reality. Thousands of extrajudicial killings had changed the country irrevocably. A nation of martyrs has become a country of killers. Some of the early vigilantes called it right. We are Duterte, they said. Evangelista’s account is a memoir of her coverage of the EJKs and what led her to it (it is subtitled “A Memoir of Murder in My Country”); but it is also reportage, some new and some already published but expanded, filled with even more detail and drawn with more context, all of it reworked into a whole; it is, lastly, an analysis, of how a democracy can die. Much of that analysis reflects a writer’s sensibility. Evangelista, in the field, looks for the telling detail or the outrageous fact; at her writing table, she looks for the enabling word, the language that kills. In this review’s lead paragraph, for instance, she will likely seize on the idiomatic irony of “making good on” a promise of evil, and write a thoughtful paragraph or page on how ostensibly moral phrasing can subvert morality. Since her twenties, Evangelista has had a reputation for beautiful writing. (It isn’t true, as she asserts in a self-effacing passage, that she was hired to write a column by the Philippine Daily Inquirer only because of her youth.) Her stories from the war on drugs, especially those in Part II, will add to that reputation. “Marcelo worked as a truck driver’s assistant. He lived, with his partner and three children, in a house just a few feet from the shanty where his mother had given birth to him thirty-one years earlier. Unlike many of the Payatas settlements, the Daa home sat in a remote clearing, requiring a long walk downhill from the main highway, through a patch of woods where the thick canopy of trees did little to mask the stench of the nearby dump site. The Daas lived in a lonely huddle of squat houses pieced together from tarps and plywood, their tin roofs weighed down by large rocks and washbasins and a chipped Blue’s Clues doorstop lying on its side. A sixty-foot ravine curved around the edges.” Comparing this paragraph with the original and already fine description, in the Rappler series in which it appeared, the reader can see that the phrasing has tightened, even though more detail had been added. And the reworking of that last sentence, cutting it just so, reflects and raises the tension in that story. But her account also includes passages like these (this one is on “salvage” in Philippine English): “Salvage-as-murder does not exist in most Filipino dictionaries. Nor does the definition appear in the many English-Filipino compendiums that are available for academic use. But every child in my country knows this meaning …. A salvage yard is not a fenced-in path of concrete with secondhand cars and vintage lamps for thrifting. A salvage yard is a street corner in Tondo, or the right lane of an overpass at dawn. A salvage yard is a cemetery, unless there is no one to give the dead man a name.” It is this attention to both detail and diction that sets Evangelista’s work apart. Doing the inconceivable. “I spent much of my time sorting through the convoluted grammar of official police reports,” she writes, in another characteristically self-deprecating self-description. But out of this basic step, Police Beat Reporting 101, she captures the accidental anti-poetry of bureaucratic language, which makes the inconceivable doable. For instance: “Cops [in a buy-bust operation] use the same word for fulfillment as is used for newlyweds: consummation. ‘After the consummated transaction,’ read one police report, ‘poseur-buyer and companion arrested the suspect.’” Another instance: “In the black-and-white of a Philippine spot report, ‘suspect sensed presence of lawmen’ comes just before ‘suspect drew his firearm’.” On August 15, 2017, in what became colloquially known as a One Time Big Time operation, 32 persons were killed in one province alone. At least eight spot reports filed by the police struck a variation of the same theme of presence sensed. Evangelista quotes the reports, and presents them one after the other. “At 12.20 a.m., suspects Bernard Lizardo and Justine Bucacao, ‘after sensing that they were dealing with an undercover police poseur’ …. At 12.40 a.m., suspects Jimmy Gorgon and Bartolome Marin ‘sensed the presence of operatives’.” And so on, until 4.30 am. The cumulative effect is both hilarious and horrifying. And yet another instance: “There is a phrase that has been used whenever police officers sit down to brag about their prowess in the field. It is also a phrase that appears in a certain species of police report …. The suspect is discovered dead, or almost dead, but that discovery occurs only after ‘the smoke of gunfire subsides.’ In Binondo … ‘after the smoke of gun battle subsided’ two suspects were ‘seen sprawled lifeless inside the rooms of the small house.’ In Santa Cruz, ‘when the smoke of gunfire subsided,’ police reported the subject ‘lay in the cemented pavement mortally wounded’. The same is true for a man in Tondo, found dead just after ‘the smoke of gunfire subsided,’ and in Jose Abad Santos, where another subject was found lying on another cemented pavement dead of gunshot wounds—‘after the smoke of gunfire subsided’.” Duterte, more rambling than a police report but with straighter grammar, comes under the same scrutiny. Evangelista’s “sorting” of the President’s speech is a series of compelling compilations, a Greatest Hits collection, of violent rhetoric. She recounts what amounts to Duterte’s origin story, as the man with the iron hand (she carefully indicates, in one of her fastidious endnotes, that Duterte had related this story at least six times). It involves his encounter as a new mayor of Davao City with the unrepentant rapist of an 18-month-old baby. The rapist, asked why he did it, gave a truly monstrous answer. “If that’s the answer you get,” Duterte asked, “what will you do?” But he never did say exactly what he did to the rapist. Just that “I did do something,” with a new revolver he had received for Christmas. Don’t blame him, the President said, “if I am driven also to insanity.” In another 11 speeches, Duterte claimed that 77,000 people had died in the hands of drug addicts in the three to four years before his election. “You know, in the wake of the drug contamination in the Philippines, 77,000 deaths, drug-related. Who will answer for that? Who will take the cudgels for those innocent—the young women raped? The ones held up in jeepneys—who will answer for them?” (Evangelista quickly and completely debunks Duterte’s mistaken statistics.) But the point of all the alleged numbers was dehumanization: “A lot of them are no longer viable as human beings in this planet,” he said. In another seven speeches, at least, “His Excellency Rodrigo Duterte, commander in chief, ordered his own men to violate not just the spirit but the letter of the law.” Shoot the suspect, he said, or hinted at it – and he said it again and again, in Davao City, in Davao again but in another venue, in Clark Freeport, in Marawi City, again in Davao, in Quezon City, in the presidential palace. Language as an enabler. In a particularly provocative passage that runs over four pages, Evangelista questions her own translation of the Filipino word for “beautiful,” in posting about Duterte’s monstrous response to the One Time Big Time operation in Bulacan province, which killed 32 suspects in one night. Of the death toll, the President had said, “Maganda yun.” In her social media, Evangelista posted her translation of the President’s words: “That’s good.” In Some People Need Killing, Evangelista writes: “In Filipino, maganda means ‘beautiful.’ It can also mean ‘good.’ It was unclear what the President meant that afternoon in August, but there was a reason every English-language local news organization chose to use the word good instead of beautiful. Good, as egregious a judgment as it was, was far less outrageous than beautiful. Beautiful would have offered an element of pleasure, a romanticizing of brutality, the impression that the commander in chief of a democratic republic  was not just pleased but delighted by the ruthless killing of his citizens.” What follows is an extraordinary list of the many things that Duterte had called beautiful in public. Perhaps nothing catches both Duterte’s appeal as a leader and the anomaly of his leadership so accurately – and yes, even beautifully – as the list Evangelista put together. It includes the President’s older girlfriend (“more beautiful than the other one”), his sidearm, Melania Trump, his circumcised penis, bodies that “only had one bullet hole in each head” – and yes, 32 suspects killed in one night. If those are the answers you get, what will you do? Evangelista suggests we must pay attention to the normalization of abusive or violent language, because it can quickly become the rhetoric of authoritarian return. Several stories stand out in Evangelista’s account: The fifth man, the tragedy of Heart de Chavez, the bizarre police friend, the slapping of Djastin with a D. The build-up to her one encounter with the vigilante leader known familiarly as Commander Maning is well-paced and thrilling (and differs markedly from the original Rappler series). Only the second chapter seemed to me to be weak; Philippine history was painted with too broad a brush. But I counted 11 instances when her stories, or her writing, stopped me momentarily – and the first of these, a revelation about her grandfather, was in that second chapter. Another passage that stopped me: Her disquisition on the transformation of the word “laban” or fight, associated with the opposition leader Ninoy Aquino, to “nanlaban,” or fought back, now forever part of the enabling language of the war on drugs. She also provides checklists, of a sort. For the aspiring journalist, two pages worth. For the aspiring vigilante, three. The enormity of evil requires more space.

6,John Nery,"The answers she gave in two Senate hearings were mystifying, and deeply problematic. But then the public discourse swirling about her is equally cringeworthy. The views expressed by the writer are his/her own and do not necessarily reflect the views or positions of Rappler. There IS reason to think that she was a mere stand-in for some principal. She said she didn’t know who some of her fellow incorporators were (even though some of them were also listed as incorporators in other businesses she was a part of); she said she didn’t know how much rental income the Baofu compound in Bamban earned, even though she said that before divesting she owned 50% of the company; she said she couldn’t say exactly how much her businessman-father gave her, or how often, but only that the money came in large amounts – half a million, or a million, or 2 million, at a time. There IS reason for the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC), which led the raid on the Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) located in the compound, to believe that she remains involved in Baofu. Part of the evidence trail leads back to her: A letter of no objection she filed on behalf of Hongsheng Gaming Technology, the original company with a POGO license; utility statements for Hongsheng up until November 2023, six months after its license had been canceled and over a year since Guo became mayor; a vehicle in the compound registered to her; a current Tarlac Electric Cooperative bill in her name and title (“Mayor Alice Guo, Pandan, Bamban”). There IS reason for the Department of the Interior and Local Government to seek her preventive suspension. The mystery of the missing grinders and grinder operators is proof of the kind of costly foot-dragging that a sitting mayor can force an entire bureaucracy to adopt. One Friday after the raid, PAOCC enlisted the cooperation of Bamban-based grinder operators to open all the 27 safes and vaults found in the compound the following Monday. That Monday, none of the equipment could be found, and all the operators, whether working for the municipality or in the private sector, were away on what PAOCC was told was a town-sponsored seminar. PAOCC ended up using acetylene torches. And there IS reason for the public to suspect her citizenship was not genuine. The discrepancies in the wedding dates of her listed parents as recorded in her birth certificate (registered when she was already 19) and in the birth certificates of two of her siblings; her own insistence that her father was a Chinese national but all the children’s birth certificates identified him as Filipino; the negative certification from the Philippine Statistics Authority that there is no record of birth of either Angelito Guo or Amelia Leal and no record of their marriage – these irregularities are concerning. But of equal concern, in my view, is the heat and hate, the virulent vitriol, of public opinion about her. Two aspects of the current public discourse swirling about Mayor Guo should give us pause. Filipino racism. In the May 22 Senate hearing, committee chair Senator Risa Hontiveros was careful to say at the start that the issue of Mayor Guo’s citizenship was directly related to the issue under investigation – if unscrupulous operators were using POGO as legal cover to run criminal syndicates that trafficked in persons and forced them into criminal acts. Whether Guo is a Filipino citizen is germane to her ownership of various companies, and of course to her eligibility as mayor. The controversy caused by her two appearances in the Senate has generated a tsunami of social media memes. In my own view, the funniest, but also the most searing, was the juxtaposing of two captioned images from two Senate hearings: above, Guo shown speaking her most memorable line (“Lumaki po ako sa farm” – literally, I grew up on a farm), and below, Senator Cynthia Villar, wife of the country’s richest man and symbol of a business empire with a reputation for turning agricultural land into commercial property, with the imagined caption “Saang farm ba ‘yan (Where is that farm)? A joke very like a condominium: Many levels! But together with all the funny came all the ugly. Guo has been deservedly criticized for her lapses in memory or general evasiveness, but she has also been hated on, insulted, mocked, reviled, for how she looks, how she sounds, how her tongue moves, how Chinese she must be. That is racism, plain and simple. Old attitudes against the Chinese in the Philippines lurk not too far beneath the surface. Scratch the skin, and the insults, the condescension, the paranoia, come spilling out. The trigger doesn’t have to be a controversial mayor’s obvious nonsense under oath; it can be anything, even superlative and exemplary achievement. I remember the case of Tiffany Grace Uy, who graduated summa cum laude from the University of the Philippines in 2015 with the highest general weighted average since before World War II: a 1.004. That new record was headline news, before it became social media fodder. An idiot posted: “Another Chinese blood…listed in the history of UP, a University suppose [sic] to be for FILIPINO and for POOR.” Another wrote: “Chinese amp (short for the expletive ‘amputa,’ itself short for ‘anak ng puta’ or son of a whore) wala bang pure Pinoy naman (is there no pure Filipino this time)?” A third idiot, feeling the compulsion to say something smart, wrote: “Ask her what she’s gna (gonna) do about China’s territorial grabbing – if she is our president now. She will fail.” In comments like these, we can see the familiar patterns of anti-Chinese racism in the Philippines: They know how to make money, they are not true or pure Filipinos, they are not loyal to the Philippines. To be sure, under Xi Jinping’s leadership, Beijing’s aggressive expansionism in the South China Sea and especially in parts of the West Philippine Sea have deepened concerns among the Philippine public; since at least 2012, a steady pulse of majority support beats for a more assertive Philippine response. The possibility that Mayor Guo is not only complicit but actively taking part in a Beijing-directed conspiracy to infiltrate the Philippine political class has of course not been ruled out; the inquiry is continuing. It adds fuel to the fire. But that fire threatens to singe, or even consume, many innocents: good Filipino citizens of Chinese ancestry, who like many of their forebears have chosen to devote their lives to the country. Political sensationalism. As a direct result of the controversy Guo provoked in the May 7 hearing, the next one, on May 22, not only attracted a larger audience but also drew more senators. In previous hearings, it had only been Hontiveros and an equally hardworking Senator Sherwin Gatchalian directing the inquiry. This time, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada and senators Raffy Tulfo and Loren Legarda joined the fray. In over a quarter-century of journalism, I’ve seen many old truths upended, but the power of the Senate to direct national attention remains largely true. Even in a fragmented media landscape, the Senate retains enough political and media capital to set the public agenda; consider Pharmally, or the pastillas scam. As a counter-example, consider the House of Representatives; only a tiny fistful of House investigations end up shaping public opinion. If the larger political objective is to generate public support and momentum to finally stop the operation of POGOs in the Philippines, then the presence of additional senators can only be an advantage. Someone like Tulfo, who created an alternative information infrastructure based on delivering justice to ordinary citizens and then converted that into a political base, is especially welcome. And yet. The public appeal that returned Estrada to the Senate and placed Tulfo in its inner sanctum is built on a kind of political sensationalism, an appreciation of politics as theater, offering spectacle and, occasionally, even catharsis. I did not expect either Estrada or Tulfo to have undertaken the same preparations for the hearing as Hontiveros and Gatchalian, who have been at the POGO-as-scam-hub issue for much longer. Estrada tried to offer something new, but in a way that was teleserye-like. He said he had received information that a mayor from Pangasinan province was a) Mayor Guo’s lover or partner and b) he was the one actually running the POGO business in Tarlac. Guo denied the double insinuation. Estrada and Guo then engaged in an exchange, lasting several rounds, of sly accusation and repeated denial that the people gathered in the Senate session hall found amusing. Hontiveros had to admonish Guo, reminding her that it was “no laughing matter.” But it was entertainment – precisely of the kind we have come to expect from Estrada, who inherited his father’s gift. Tulfo did not offer any new information; instead, he contributed his theory of human psychology, an essential feature of his shows. At one point, he criticized Guo for failing to respond with what he called “but natural and human reaction.” At another point, refusing to accept that the issue of bloodlines and family relations was, as Guo said, a sensitive issue for her family, he said that Guo should have told off her father: “C’mon, Dad. Give me a break. Tell the truth. I deserve the truth, right?” To this cinematic cliche, Tulfo added a pronouncement. “Oh, you didn’t ask that? I don’t believe you.” Instead of entertainment, Tulfo offered severity of judgment, the kind of tough-talking therapy he uses on his shows. In a particularly revealing and sensational address, delivered in a mix of Filipino and English, he spoke to Guo directly: “Alam naman talaga namin kung sino ka, kaya lang (We already know who you are, but) it’s very hard for us right now to find out, that’s why we’re trying to get more information about who you really are, because we know, and everybody knows…and you know in your heart, na inconsistent ka (that you’re inconsistent) and you’re lying.” We have already judged you, even though we are still gathering the facts: That, plus entertainment value, sums up much of the current public discourse about the issue today. What should we, as a country, do about Mayor Alice Guo? Follow the often-flawed processes of accountability. (The Senate is not a court.) Follow the money. (Estrada made a really sensible suggestion, to invite Guo’s father to the Senate investigation. Perhaps he understands the role of a patriarch in a family with many interests.) Follow the law. The one thing we should stop following are our worst instincts. To tweak the famous quote from the other Pogo (the good one, the comic strip character): “We have met the enemy, and he is also us.”",0
7,John Nery,"Confusing one with the other allows disinformation peddlers like SMNI to claim rights they don’t possess. Here’s an anecdote from the 1990s. A friend’s brother was waiting for a ride outside a convenience store in a gasoline station when a pair of men pulled a knife on him. Suddenly, a female journalist rushed out of the store, brandished her press ID, and ran toward the group, shouting, “Media ‘to! Media ‘to” (I’m media)! The startled men scattered, leaving the brother unharmed. Much about this story seems incredible, even apocryphal. The woman rushing out to break up a crime in progress is only the most outstanding detail. But the fearless or even reckless use of press identification as a kind of shield hits different now, a decade and a half after the Ampatuan massacre and mere years after the Duterte presidency demonized the press wholesale. Recalling the story now, I am struck by how dated – that is to say how characteristic of a particular time – the encounter was. It couldn’t have happened during the martial law era; I doubt if it can happen these days. It strikes me now as a relic from the last 15 years of the 20th century and the first 10 of the 21st, a high point for what we now call legacy media. But in my retelling of this encounter, I used key terms interchangeably. I identified a journalist, I mentioned a press card, I recalled what the friend’s brother heard his rescuer shout about being a member of the media. In ordinary conversation, in polite banter, in informal settings, we interchange “journalism,” “press,” and “media” all the time. By and large, we mean the same thing, though we use different words. We understand; we are understood. But the journalism professor and media critic Jay Rosen, whom I have been following for almost three decades now (first on the internet and then on social media), makes a helpful distinction between the three terms. 
On February 22, 2021, in the depths of the pandemic, Rosen posted a 26-tweet thread that drew important distinctions (and that was itself a demonstration of the importance of making distinctions). One of the tweets read: Media, journalism, and the press are not interchangeable terms. Yet they are bound up with one another. Media is the attention industry Journalism is a social practice The press is a key institution in a democracy Journalists who work in the media carry forward ‘the press’. Rosen had previously made a distinction between audience (“people attending to a common object, typically a performance or spectacle”) and public (“people with different interests who live in the same space and share common problems”). He wrote: “An audience is not a public.” He also wrote: “I think of the media as an attention business, an industry whose product is audiences.” Set of practices. By media, then, he means the system or the business that underlies journalism (as well as other forms of audience-seeking content). By journalism, he means the current set of practices that journalists follow, to do their work. And by the press as institution, he means (and this is my understanding of the idea) a democratic office – that is, a public position of some authority and service. This was not the first time Rosen drew the distinctions. For instance, in a wide-ranging conversation in April 2012 with Ethan Zuckerberg, then with the Center for Civic Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he spoke of this “tripartite” nature in depth. (See Jay Rosen’s Three-Layer Journalism Cake, or watch the forum on the MIT website.) Starting with an ode to the political thinker Hannah Arendt, who was a master at making distinctions, Rosen prefaced his remarks by attempting to “pull apart” the three terms. “The practice of journalism, that’s one thing…the practice is what people do when they’re doing journalism.” “The second thing I want to talk about…is the underlying media system that the practice runs on.” By media, he said, he meant “the way that we produce information, distribute it, connect people to it, in society as a whole. That’s different than the practice of journalism.” Then he said: “The third thing that we should be able to pull apart is the institution of the press…. The press as an institution, first of all, is different from country to country. The reason it’s different from country to country is it’s very powerfully a product of law. If you don’t have laws establishing freedom of the press, you don’t have any press. You might have journalism, you might have a media system, but you don’t have a press because everything that happens is just a pale reflection of power. So until you have a public sphere, until you have a free press, until you have a legal system that secures the right of a free press, you can’t have a press.” Threefold distinctions. I have found these distinctions to be decidedly useful. I had a chance to address a small group of United Nations regional officials in Bangkok in 2023 together with other guests, and I used my time to explain these threefold distinctions, and to argue that they can be used to align or prioritize UN work or assistance in freedom-of-expression and access-to-information issues.
Do reporters or photographers have the right to organize themselves as a labor union? While this question has freedom-of-the-press implications, it is (I submit) eminently a media issue – that is, it relates to the business or system side, as do questions about reasonable wages or working hours. Should all journalists, including editors and producers, follow company policies regulating social media use? While this question has media-as-business implications, it is (I suggest) primarily a journalism issue – that is, it relates to the set of practices that journalists follow as they do their work.
Can a reporter be required by an executive agency to reveal the source of particularly damning allegations? While this question has journalism-as-a-practice implications, it is (I wager) firstly a free press issue. Journalists must be able to guarantee their anonymous sources, especially those fearing retaliation or even violence for the mere act of speaking out, that their identities will be protected. (Unlike, say, in the United States, the Philippines since 1946 has had the benefit of the Sotto Law protecting the duty of journalists to not reveal their sources.) In the case of SMNI, or Sonshine Media Network International, the broadcast network owned by Apollo Quiboloy’s religious group, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ or KOJC, the airing of an erroneous report or commentary about Speaker Martin Romualdez is not and should not be cause enough to suspend its operations temporarily or to revoke its congressional franchise permanently. That is to give too much consideration, and power, to one man. The wisdom of that venerable libel ruling from the Supreme Court, now over a hundred years old, remains true: “Men in public life may suffer under a hostile and an unjust accusation; the wound can be assuaged with the balm of a clear conscience.”
Suspending SMNI for running a false report on Romualdez is abuse of power – but against what? Against SMNI as a media entity, a business organized to meet the communication objectives of KOJC. A one-strike-and-you’re-out policy is prejudicial to the officers and staff of a company that, because of the nature of the business it is in, is vulnerable to mistakes. If this unfair standard protecting prickly politicians were applied to all media companies, none would be left standing. An anchor or commentator making a terrible error on air is a media issue, because the inevitable occasional error is a matter for the company’s Human Resources department. Policies are or should be in place to enjoin officers and staff not to broadcast an unverified story, to correct an erroneous claim, to sanction those who err, to prevent a recurrence. Pattern of lies. But what about repeated errors or, in the case of hosts Lorraine Badoy Partosa and Jefffey Celiz, a long-term pattern of outright lies and dangerous red-tagging? That situation may be covered by an HR policy too, but at its core it is a journalism issue. It is about the standards of care and responsibility that hosts of a news and commentary program should meet in doing their work. In other words, their record shows that Badoy-Partosa and Celiz have been doing the opposite of journalism: malicious propaganda. Under Section 4 of the law renewing the SMNI franchise (through its parent company), the willful and repeated airing of disinformation is an outright violation of SMNI’s contract with the public: “not use its stations or facilities…for the dissemination of deliberately false information or willful misrepresentation, to the detriment of the public interest.” The case filed by the Movement Against Disinformation with the National Telecommunications Commission against SMNI is based precisely on this reading. But isn’t the attempt to recall SMNI’s franchise an attack on the free press? What’s the difference between SMNI and ABS-CBN, whose franchise Congress refused to renew under pressure from Rodrigo Duterte? The difference is the purpose for which the networks are used and, because form follows function, the way the networks are organized. For all its shortcomings, ABS-CBN sought and continues to seek to serve the public (not its audiences alone) by reporting the whole picture. Despite its self-described status as a “nation-builder,” SMNI serves the needs of KOJC and its “Appointed Son of God.” Does this mean that no religious station can qualify as the press? Not at all. As Rosen argued: “Journalists who work in the media carry forward ‘the press.’” It is the work that serves the public (distinct from the audience). What separates SMNI (and also NET25 at particular junctures in history) from other religious stations is that it willingly serves as a platform for propaganda and disinformation. It does not serve as an office, an institution, of democracy.

8,John Nery,"The complicated but lasting legacy of Benedict XVI. Benedict XVI was a pope of paradoxes: the progressive peritus in Vatican II turned conservative gatekeeper of Council teaching, the extraordinarily gifted theologian who limited debate and silenced Catholic academics, above all the guardian of reform whose startling resignation reformed the Roman Catholic Church in the most fundamental way. His death at the age of 95 was truly the end of an era: He is the last of the popes (after John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II) directly involved in the Second Vatican Council, which convened from 1962 to 1965. Pope Francis, who was still a Jesuit scholastic at the time, was ordained a priest only in 1969. It is also possible that, if the pope who succeeds Pope Francis comes from the Global South again, Benedict may be the last European to serve as pope for some time to come. It is almost certain that the age of European dominance in the Church ended with Benedict’s death. Or to be more precise, the dominance of the thinking that understands the Church as a European institution, highlighted by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger’s second reason for choosing Benedict as his papal name—to honor the great St. Benedict, he said, who “evokes the Christian roots of Europe.” But another generation to which Benedict belongs, that of the men and women who were scandalized by the worldwide youth protests of 1968 and channeled their shock and concern into conservative movements in culture and politics and religion, remains influential. Old habits. In the immediate aftermath of his death, heightened emotions and old habits led to some exaggerated claims. Jean-Pierre Denis, publisher of the international editions of the La Croix newspaper, began his thoughtful appreciation of Benedict’s considerable intellectual legacy by describing him as “the last great European intellectual of the 20th century” – a remarkable claim, considering that other influential thinkers who made their mark in the last century, including one with whom Benedict engaged in an important dialogue, Jurgen Habermas, remain very much alive. It is also remarkable that a scholar of the highest quality served as pope; perhaps this is all that Denis meant, that Benedict was a theologian of great influence and consequence, who earned the esteem of other scholars even outside the discipline of theology. Michael Sean Winters, writing insightfully for the National Catholic Reporter, described Benedict’s decision to resign as “a great act of demystification” of the papal office (objectively true) but also as “an implicit, unspoken rebuke” to Pope, now Saint, John Paul II and his decision to remain in office “despite the incapacities of old age” (an interpretation, not a fact, which discounts Benedict’s own well-considered reason). It is possible to learn from the example of others without the learning necessarily being an act of criticism, much less a rebuke. It is true that Benedict did not want to wither in office as John Paul II did. As he himself said, in his Latin message announcing his resignation: “I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to advanced age, are no longer suitable for the proper exercise of the Petrine ministry.” But that was his own charism, or special gift: The humility to step aside. His predecessor’s was altogether different: The gift to suffer in public. As Benedict said in his homily at John Paul II’s funeral mass: “he increasingly entered into the communion of Christ’s sufferings … And in this very communion with the suffering Lord, tirelessly and with renewed intensity, he proclaimed the gospel, the mystery of that love which goes to the end.” Describing the resignation as a rebuke is an old habit of journalism, storifying conflict even when none exists. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, in a piece that characteristically offered an alternative history of the modern Church, rued that Benedict had “conducted a postpapacy of ambiguous gestures in response to a Vatican that had been delivered, by the mysteries of God’s providence, to his longtime foes.” This is an old habit of partisans and ideologues, framing reality as a constant struggle. But Douthat makes it sound as though Benedict’s retirement (at almost 10 years, longer than his papacy) was spent conducting these ambiguous gestures, instead of the almost uninterrupted life of prayer, contemplation – and unequivocal support for Pope Francis – that it mainly was. New media. As a journalist and a Catholic, I have always been fascinated by Benedict’s understanding of the way the media works. I understand that other people helped in the drafting of, say, his messages for World Communications Day, but comparing his messages with those of Pope Francis, to give an example, immediately shows that their thinking, their personalities, are reflected in the words they choose to release under their own name. Many of Benedict’s WCD messages centered on what he called the “digital continent,” the new “agora” created by digital technology. In 2009, he touched on an essential feature of social media networks like Facebook. “The concept of friendship has enjoyed a renewed prominence in the vocabulary of the new digital social networks that have emerged in the last few years … We should be careful … never to trivialize the concept or the experience of friendship.” In 2011, he noted that the new digital technologies “allow people to meet each other beyond the confines of space and of their own culture,” and then asked: “Who is my ‘neighbor’ in this new world?” In 2013, in his last message, he warned us: “Believers are increasingly aware that, unless the Good News is made known also in the digital world, it may be absent in the experience of many people for whom this existential space is important.” These insights deepen my disappointment at his alternative history of Vatican II, because it is confoundingly media-centric. In 2013, addressing Roman clergy, Benedict asserted that “there was the Council of the Fathers – the real Council – but there was also the Council of the media. It was almost a Council apart, and the world perceived the Council through the latter, through the media.” He added: “For the media, the Council was a political struggle, a power struggle between different trends int he Church.” But in fact, the Council was also a power struggle. As insider accounts prove, there was a “fierce battle” (Time’s Robert Blair Kaiser), a duel between the majority of the bishops and the reactionary Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani and his allies (peddling “papalist nonsense,” the peritus Yves Congar wrote in his diary). Sometimes, conflict does exist, and journalists do right to report on it. True legacy. Where does this paradoxical pope’s true legacy lie? While he has been criticized for his own handling of clerical sexual abuse cases when he was Archbishop of Munich, and continues to be criticized for his predecessor’s inaction, he acted decisively when he was head of the Congregation for Doctrine of the Faith. Thomas Reese, the Jesuit editor who was forced to resign from America magazine because of Benedict, wrote: “When his congregation was assigned abuse cases, the disciplinarian tendencies that led him to police theologians allowed him to cut through canonical niceties to expel hundreds, perhaps thousands, of abusers from the priesthood. His response was never perfect, but he did understand and deal with the problem quicker than any other Vatican official, including John Paul.” When he was pope, he removed an abusive religious founder from the ministry, and met with victims of abuse. His writings will continue to inspire many. His Introduction to Christianity, first published in 1968, remains a model of clarity; his many books, his three encyclicals, his Jesus trilogy (written when he was already pope), will continue to draw new readers (and old ones ready for rereading). He had the teacher’s gift for explaining even the most complicated of subjects. It should come as no surprise that he was the man in charge of John Paul’s project to publish the Catechism of the Catholic Church. “The fact that after an era of very strong theological and ecclesial debates and tensions, within a few years, that is, already by 1992, the work came to fruition in a largely convincing way has something miraculous about it,” wrote his former spokesman, Federico Lombardi SJ. Finally, his assertion of what he called the “hermeneutic of continuity and reform” will for a long time be heard differently, by those who prefer continuity and by those who seek reform of and in the Church, but his decision to resign the papacy, the first such instance in 600 years, could only have been possible because he followed that hermeneutic to the very end. He believed in both; he could resign because the Church allows reform, and he could resign in full confidence because the Church guarantees continuity. Truly a pope of paradoxes.",0
9,John Nery,"Now that she has passed the point of no return, which options will the Vice President choose? The one from 2001, or the one from 1957? The future of the Duterte political brand rests on the 2028 vote, and the run-up to it. Davao City itself remains the family stronghold. The former president’s second son Baste Duterte easily won election as mayor in 2022, his vote total more than eight times that of his closest challenger. Rep. Pulong Duterte, who cruised to victory with 15 times more votes than the next candidate, is poised to win a third term in 2025. And Vice President Sara Duterte herself won the vice-presidential contest in the city with 10% more votes than the mayor-elect; her vote total was 55 times that of the vice presidential candidate with the second highest number of votes. (Interestingly, the “people’s justice” constituency of Sen. Raffy Tulfo in Davao City was not enough to place him in the first 12 Senate slots; he came in 13th.) So mark the city safe for the Dutertes. But the rest of the country? Much will depend on what happens in the next few years: if the doomsday cult leader Apollo Quiboloy is extradited to the United States, if the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant against former president Rodrigo Duterte, if an armed encounter in the West Philippine Sea hardens Philippine public opinion against China, if the scandals involving Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators and scammy Pharmally come home to roost in Davao. It is in the best interest of the Duterte family and their allies, then, to ensure that VP Sara becomes the next president. That is how I understand her resignation from the Cabinet, and from the influential position of education secretary. (The Department of Education is the country’s largest bureaucracy.) She means to do all she can to prepare herself to succeed Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Four types of succession. But consider the vice presidents who succeeded to the presidency. History tells us there are at least four types of succession. The first path is the one contemplated by our constitutions: The president dies in office. Three found themselves traveling down this path: Sergio Osmeña succeeded Manuel Quezon in 1944, Elpidio Quirino succeeded Manuel Roxas in 1948, Carlos Garcia succeeded Ramon Magsaysay in 1957. The second trail is that blazed by Diosdado Macapagal, the first vice president elected from another party that was different from the president’s. Several months after the plane crash that claimed Magsaysay’s life, Garcia of the Nationalistas was elected president in his own right, in November 1957; for the first time, however, a president’s election mandate fell below a majority. Macapagal, because he was a Liberal, was shut out of the Cabinet. He spent the next four years essentially campaigning throughout the country, and handily beat Garcia for the presidency in 1961. The third path is the one that Joseph Estrada defined. While he belonged to a party different from that of Fidel Ramos, he accepted Ramos’ offer to include him in government through a presidential task force tailored to Estrada’s public persona as a tough-talking crimebuster. While he was not politically aligned with Ramos, he remained a popular part of the president’s official family until the end of their term. The fourth is that which unmade Estrada, and made Gloria Arroyo. A People-Powered uprising and the withdrawal of support from the military leadership forced Estrada out of office and installed Arroyo as president in 2001. Which path will VP Sara choose? Based on a reading of the many comments from Duterte supporters on social media, it seems that a good number would favor what I would call the Arroyo option. I do not mean to suggest that Gloria Arroyo, then the vice president, worked actively behind the scenes in early 2001 to undermine President Estrada; I only mean to say that the idea, held by quite a number of supporters of both the former president and his daughter, that Marcos Jr. can be forced to resign and that Sara Duterte can then replace him, is not fiction but rather fantasy fed on the events of 2001. That’s the underlying scenario behind former speaker Pantaleon Alvarez’s seditious appeal to the military to withdraw its support from President Marcos Jr. It’s a scenario nourished on regret and resentment, based on the (correct) assumption that he would not have been elected if he had not teamed up with Duterte. You can sense this skewed theme of false nostalgia run through the comments like an electric current: “She should have been president all along.” But can the Vice President and her allies engineer the ouster of another Marcos? This seems unlikely, if only because the Vice President’s father showed exactly how powerful the presidency is, despite the additional safeguards built into the 1987 Constitution. If he can brazen it out (the Rodrigo Duterte legacy), a president can outlast any rival. In other words, the moral standards or the public virtues we naturally expect of any president are not hard-wired into the system; a president acting exactly like Rodrigo Duterte can throw all that aside, and he will get away with it. Force the Supreme Court to impeach a chief justice without the benefit of impeachment, detain an incumbent senator for almost her entire term on trumped-up charges, impose martial law in Mindanao without meeting constitutional requirements, threaten opponents with mythical narco-lists and lethal red tags, demonize journalists, and so on, ad nauseam. Does Marcos Jr. have the appetite for such a political war of attrition? That remains to be seen, but it is important to remember the lesson we learned from Duterte: The presidency has the capacity to wage that kind of war. Going Macapagal. A more realistic reading of the situation suggests that VP Sara will likely follow the example of Cong Dadong, the “poor boy from Lubao,” who is not coincidentally the father of her close political ally, former president and former speaker Gloria Arroyo. Sara resigned to campaign full time for the presidency. She is now unburdened of the responsibilities of education secretary, for which she was never really qualified in the first place. The same day she resigned, the other main news story about Philippine education was yet more confirmation of its dismal state: In the 2022 cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA, the Philippines ranked in the bottom four in the world in “creative thinking.” This is the sort of news that will haunt any education secretary thinking of a presidential run; by the time VP Sara runs for the presidency in 2028, she would have distanced herself enough from such depressing statistics. (And if the work of the Second Congressional Commission on Education actually bears fruit by then, she can point to her participation, non-consequential but real, in the commission’s initial stages.) She is now free from the need to defend any policy of the Marcos Jr. administration, or at least to keep silent, and free to criticize it on the issues that matter most to the Dutertes and their allies: engagement with the ICC, defense of the West Philippine Sea, peace talks with the communist insurgency. She is now at liberty to test the one message of her father’s that never resonated with the public, the one theme he couldn’t sell: that our future lies in a closer alliance with Beijing. Coming out this early, and this unequivocally, carries a serious risk. If a somewhat cloying reticence propelled her to the top of the pre-election surveys before allying with Marcos Jr., how will undisguised ambition affect her standings? That calls for all kinds of creative thinking.",0
10,John Nery,"The communist insurgency is at its weakest. Counter-intuitively, now is the best time for both sides to resume peace talks and reach a peace deal. A new report by the International Crisis Group published in April concludes that the “Maoist insurgency in the Philippines is at its lowest ebb in decades.” From a high of 25,000 armed regulars in the last years of the Marcos regime, the number of rebels is down to somewhere between 1,200 and 2000 – roughly speaking, close to the same number when the first President Marcos used the then-new insurgency as a pretext for imposing martial rule in 1972. The insurgency is hampered by serious organizational challenges, including “perhaps the most severe leadership crisis in its history” (provoked not only by the death of its founder but also by “the killing [by the Philippine military] of several high-ranking commanders over the last three years”); a reduction in revenues generated from so-called revolutionary taxation (because of the loss of territory and “the arrest of financial operatives”); and internal confusion (“differences among cadres regarding the movement’s political and military direction”). These and other crises can be seen reflected, even without the benefit of context, in the message the Communist Party of the Philippines published to mark its 55th anniversary. Without reference to the combination of military pressure and development outreach that the government has been leveling against the insurgency, the message may read as yet another (though still remarkably candid) exercise in the revolutionary discipline of “criticism and self-criticism.” But read in the context of the rebellion’s continuing loss of leaders, fighters, base areas, resources, and informal support structures, these passages from the December 26, 2023, message confirm that the movement is, in fact, in bad shape. The message recognized that “not a few guerrilla fronts of the [New Peoples Army] stagnated and got stuck for a long time at the old level.” The cause, however, was identified as “some Party leaders,” who “self-constricted the NPA to its reliable guerrilla base areas and mountain encampments, limiting the scope or range of military and political initiative of the Party and NPA. Self-constriction goes against the need for guerrilla units to constantly move forward and advance, and to be always on offensive footing. Reliable guerrilla base areas were eventually reduced to a few ‘favorite’ or ‘comfort zone’ barrios, communities or mountain encampments with easy access to mass support, supply lines or communication facilities.” Military conservatism. The message developed its argument with even more candor: “Self-constriction and loss of initiative leads to military conservatism, as points from which the NPA can hit the enemy became limited or inaccessible. Other concomitant problems that arise include gathering intelligence, sources of supply, communications, and so on. The NPA could not readily carry out an ambush at the highway because its main forces are encamped in the interior areas. Mounting raids, ambushes, and other basic tactical offensives became increasingly cumbersome and time-consuming. They became content with attrition tactical offensives (harassment, sanctions and so on) and lost sight of the need to mount sustained annihilation or basic tactical offensives as the principal component of our strategy to weaken the enemy part by part and steadily strengthen the people’s army. “In a significant number of guerrilla fronts which had company-sized or multiple-platoon-sized forces, some Party leaders became complacent and self-assured. There were cases of over concentration of forces in some regions or sub-regions, where two or more guerrilla companies are brought together in a mountain encampment over extended periods of several months, to conduct trainings, education courses, prolonged meetings or to await execution of an ill-planned offensive, leaving less [sic] forces and less time for mass work. These prolonged encampments caused a heavy strain on the organized masses and militia forces who have to work hard to keep the supply lines running. These also cause guerrilla discipline to slacken and ‘civilianize’ guerrilla forces. Some NPA units have encountered problems of drinking among guerrilla fighters.” And so on, in this vein. The Crisis Group report characterized the CPP as “mindful of these challenges,” and summarized the message of December 2023 (and that of March 2024 too) as a call to “galvanize the movement” and “reinvigorate political and logical education for cadres and combatants.” Peace talks. Does it make strategic sense for the Philippine government to restart peace talks with the CPP-NPA and its National Democratic Front? The joint announcement last November of an agreement to resume peace negotiations was a real surprise – and was met with a mix of skepticism and hope. The skeptical response raised suspicions about political maneuvering ahead of the 2025 midterm elections; when Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ran again for the Senate in 2010, he was on the same slate as Bayan Muna’s Satur Ocampo and Gabriela’s Liza Masa. The hopeful stance recognized that one of the administration’s signatories of the Joint Statement for Peace was Special Adviser to the President Anton Lagdameo, President Marcos’ closest friend. But if the insurgency is at its weakest, why even attempt to strike a peace deal? Shouldn’t the government continue its current campaign mixing military pressure and development outreach until the last base area is recovered, the last guerrilla front overrun? It has already been about a decade since the national security establishment under the second Aquino administration came to the conclusion that the communist insurgency was no longer the country’s main national-security threat. The pivot to external defense or territorial defense operations (TDO) under the second Marcos administration formalizes the downgrading of the insurgency. Peace negotiations will help ease the pivot to external defense. That is the first reason why the Marcos administration should return to the negotiating table. The second reason is the law of diminishing returns; the counter-insurgency campaign that has helped reduce the size of the NPA by about half, since Rodrigo Duterte came to power, may have already reached its optimal phase. Besides, the kind of justification often offered by those who would like the current campaign to continue is very much along the lines of “crushing” the rebellion. The rebels are on the run, why stop hot pursuit? Because history’s lesson is clear. According to “Paths to Victory,” the 2013 RAND Corporation study of 71 insurgencies (updated from its influential 2010 study of 30 insurgencies, titled “Victory Has a Thousand Fathers”), the so-called “iron fist” path succeeds “only 32 percent of the time,” while its opposite approach, the so-called motive-focused path, succeeds 73 percent of the time. The iron fist approach to counterinsurgency (COIN) focuses primarily on “eliminating the insurgent threat,” while the motive path addresses “the motives for beginning and sustaining the insurgency.” In other words, the iron fist seeks to hammer the insurgents to oblivion, while the motive-focused approach resolves the conditions that gave rise to and supplies the insurgency. And the lesson from the history of insurgency from 1944 to 2010 is that the COIN odds do not favor the use of force alone. To quote the 2013 study: “The importance of reducing insurgents’ tangible support is the center-most finding of this research. Successful COIN forces reduce not only the active insurgents but also the support that fuels the insurgency.” But the Philippine Army, by far the largest of the services, has more invested in continuing the counterinsurgency campaign than any other institution; it is, hyperbolically, the only thing they know. They (and the Duterte political alliance) may stand in the way. Weaker position. Does it make strategic sense for the communist insurgency to enter into peace talks? As the scattered leadership must be only too aware, they will be returning to the negotiating table with a much weaker position. But they do own a conspicuous advantage: They offer the second President Marcos the historic opportunity of ending the insurgency that started under the first President Marcos. If the Marcos family were serious about rehabilitating their family name, concluding real peace with the communist rebels would rank high among the pathways to rehabilitation – not as high as paying their billion-peso tax arrears or returning their ill-gotten wealth, but high enough to cement their new reputation in Western capitals. But peace talks may also result in the suspension of red-tagging and red-baiting by government and military officials (the provocative actions of Duterte supporters is a different problem altogether), and may create the momentum necessary to review and improve the work of the task force overseeing the government’s COIN campaign. Not the abolition that UN Special Rapporteur Irene Kahn had strongly recommended (that looks outside the realm of political probability), but at least a change that renders it more community-oriented, more representative, more civilian. (The Crisis Group makes the same recommendations.) Time to talk peace again.",0
11,Iris Gonzales,"Inside Bangladesh, it’s called the Gen Z revolution as young students from Dhaka University began protesting last month to demand an end to the government’s jobs quota system.

The system, according to a CNN report on the Bangladesh crisis, reserves 30 percent of civil service posts for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.

“Many of the country’s contemporary political elite are related to that generation – including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.”

Following days of protests which had turned bloody, the 76-year-old Prime Minister Hasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter to India.

Hasina’s sudden exit ends 15 years in power, which were marred by dissent because her government, according to critics and human rights organizations, stifled civil liberties.

Amid joblessness, high inflation in the post-pandemic era and the growing curtailment of freedom, protestors demanded change.

Ironically, Hasina led a democratic uprising against military rule in 1990. Now she has found herself in the same situation but at the other end of the uprising.

It was a long time coming. It was not a revolution that happened overnight.

Prior to the July 1 protest, critics and human rights organizations have already expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, harassment of the media and opposition figures, crackdown on freedom of expression online as well as arbitrary detention and torture in Bangladesh.

Tipping point
This was not the first time that protests hounded Hasina’s government even as she managed to survive previous demonstrations.

The recent protests, however, were different as police shot and killed the young dissidents in full view of their peers.

This seemed to be the tipping point. Protestors could no longer be stopped, not even by the threat of being killed by security forces.

“Driving the anger was high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it slowed in the post-pandemic era and is beset with high inflation and depleted foreign currency reserves. In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education,” according to CNN.

This could be the first major successful Gen Z revolution in world history, said Sabrina Karim, associate professor of government at Cornell University, who specializes in the study of political violence, as quoted by CNN.

People Power I
The Philippines is no stranger to uprisings.

In 1986, we inspired the world with the historic bloodless People Power revolt which toppled Ferdinand Marcos Sr.

Whether in the Philippines or in Bangladesh, however, the challenge is how to protect the freedoms we’ve fought for and successfully won.

The challenge is to fulfill that promise of change that protests and revolutions strived to usher in.

Leaders of change must make sure that they are indeed capable of becoming the change they want to see in their country; that they wouldn’t just turn into the next monster or ogre they successfully slayed and that they wouldn’t end up being corrupted by the system they vehemently opposed and tried to change.

Otherwise, it will just be a cycle of boom and bust; of authoritarian rule and revolutions; of protests and military rule or, in our case, of yellows and reds; of Marcos and Aquinos; or of Marcos and Dutertes.

Look what happened to us. We toppled a dictator and showed the world how it was done only to elect another Marcos into power more than three decades later.

Ironically, some of those who protested against then president Marcos Sr. back then are now part of the government of President Marcos Jr.

One cannot blame them, however. Or the masses. Perhaps for them, nothing really changed after the 1986 People Power Revolution.

We are unique in this sense because it seems we never really learn our lessons. History just keeps repeating itself, no matter how absurd a cycle that is.

One culprit I see here is corruption.

Corruption has been around for thousands of years. Shakespeare’s plays showed vignettes of corruption, while Dante supposedly placed bribers in the deepest parts of Hell, according to the International Monetary Fund’s working paper on corruption published in 1998.

And yet, it doesn’t seem to end.

After a new candidate or a new system is in place, the initial jubilation soon fades as constituents realize that the same old system or the same old trapo is back.

In the Philippines, it’s even getting worse, especially in local government units where corruption has become so deeply entrenched.

Pay offs or grease money have gone up by 30 to 50 percent, attest some businessmen; some local chieftains even offer “bespoke pay-offs packages” to entrepreneurs who want to set up shop in their locality, depending on their capacity to pay and their needs.

Local chieftains, like lawmakers, also have their own contractors which they require businessmen to hire.

Anti-corruption bodies, including the Anti-Red Tape Authority, must look into these reports to eradicate corruption in the different branches of our government.

Revolutions can only lead to lasting changes if they topple not just flawed leaders but corrupt systems as well.

This is a lesson that Gen Z Bangladeshis must also keep in mind now that they have removed their leader from power.

Otherwise, it’s just going to be the same old story.",0
12,Iris Gonzales,"Curtains close. Kisses stop. Love stories end.

Indeed, some things in life are fleeting and ephemeral. That’s just the way it is. There’s even an old adage that says all good things come to an end.

Once in a while, however, life surprises us with something so great that it lingers and lives on in our hearts. Forever.

Such is the music of the legendary rock band Eraserheads, the kind that resonated – and continues to resonate – with generations and generations of Filipinos. Their songs were always someone's anthem and gospel truth; inspiration or palliative; a curse even but always an impetus to move and act.

It’s no surprise therefore that on Tuesday, Aug. 20, members of the band – Marcus Adoro, Ely Buendia, Raimund Marasigan and Buddy Zabala – returned to their Alma Mater, the University of the Philippines, to receive the prestigious Gawad Oblation Award, the highest distinction that the university can bestow.

Says UP president Angelo Jimenez in his welcome remarks: “The Gawad Oblation is a symbol of our deep gratitude for that extraordinary service rendered with or in our name. In the name of UP.”

It’s no exaggeration, he adds, that the Eraserheads “are a pivotal force in the history of original Pilipino music.”

“The Eraserheads helped define the music, memories and identity of a generation, no less.”

They also humanized a generation during a very very divisive period in the history of our country by asserting individuality, president Jimenez also says.

For the band members who all studied in UP Diliman, it was a full circle moment of sorts. The university, they said, was the foundation for their voice, art and music.

In their acceptance speeches, the Eraserheads said it was in UP where they tasted and experienced real freedom. “Kalayaan pumili at maghayag, kalayaan sundin at kalayaan pakingan ang sariling himig,” said Marcus.

Raimund thanked his parents who supported him even if he didn’t get to bring home a diploma, drawing laughter from the crowd. Buddy, too, thanked those who supported the band throughout their journey.

Ely recalled how music saved him from a sure failing grade in Spanish. “Singko,” says the Eheads vocalist in an exaggerated Spanish accent, drawing more laughter from the crowd.

“I begged my professor for a passing grade. And he asked me: Do you have anything that would make me consider passing you? Anything at all?

Ely told his professor:

Well I can write a song and so I gave him a demo cassette of Pare ko and prayed.

The next day, to his pleasant surprise, his professor in Spanish told him that he passed.

This experience taught Ely two things.

“One is that my professor could understand Tagalog and that two, from that point on, that music can get me through anything in life.”

A year later in Kalayaan, Ely found three people who also had his struggles and shared his dream.

The rest, as they say, is history.

For the crowd that descended into the glittering Executive House for the Gawad Oblation awarding ceremony, it was a great honor and delight to bear witness to such a momentous occasion.

President Jimenez invited me to cover the event but there at that moment, I could barely cover. I was just taking it all in with wide-eyed awe and a full heart, listening, as a huge fan, to their story.

For how could I not? It was a band that accompanied my generation in the murky years of our lives – from teenage to adulthood, those years of first loves and first heartbreaks, first defeats and first triumphs.

But for the first time, I was not watching them perform. I was listening to their stories about their UP days.

What they said about UP being a bastion of freedom and an abode to find your voice and pursue your passion is perhaps true for every UP student and alumni.

Most Distinguished Alumnus
Days before, in a separate but equally festive awarding ceremony for the UP Alumni Association awardees, tycoon Isidro “Sid” Consunji shared a similar story as a student after he was hailed as this year’s Most Distinguished Alumnus of UP.

Sid described himself as an ordinary engineering student but highlighted the fact that he also learned a lot from the time he spent in UP – outside its classrooms.

“I spent more time outside the classroom than inside, being active in Beta Epsilon Fraternity and the Association of Civil Engineering Students,” said the DMCI Holdings chairman who led this year’s roster of distinguished awardees.

I, too, was at the UPAA event, together with my family as we received the Multigenerational Alumni Family Award given to us.

On the sidelines of the event, Sid or IAC, as he is known in the business community, asked me where I get my inspiration to write my stories. In jest, I pointed to the Macallan on his table, saying it’s my poison and inspiration.

But in reality, as I stood there at both awarding ceremonies, I was reminded of the fact that its in UP indeed where I really learned to dream and pursue the things that inspire me.

As Ely Buendia said, “UP shaped not only our minds but also our souls.”

And from the others who came before us, our professors and fellow alumni included, we found the courage to carry on.

The Eraserheads and their songs, for instance, are vivid reminders of making it from one point to the next, of surviving the hardest of times and eventually thriving with a smile.",0
13,Iris Gonzales,"The Marcos administration can’t pop the champagne just yet even as Filipinos cheered the President’s big pronouncement during his State of the Nation Address, ordering a total ban on the Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs).

Now, his administration needs to do a lot of cleaning up and serious work as part of the post-POGO exit plan.

For one, the government would have to make up for the losses in revenue and business activities from the POGO exit – however insignificant our authorities deem this to be.

Economic managers said the costs of POGO far outweigh the benefits. Still, our taxman would need to find alternative sources of revenue to make up for what would be lost from the POGO industry’s exit from the country.

This is especially urgent with slower fiscal consolidation hounding the Marcos administration now and in the years to come.

Revenue
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), for instance, is now looking at taxing online sellers to raise additional revenue. According to its plan, merchants or sellers in online platforms are now subject to withholding tax effective last month.

BIR’s Revenue Regulation 16-2023 states that one-half of the gross remittances of e-marketplace operations and digital financial services providers to the sellers or merchants for goods or services shall now be subject to a one percent creditable withholding tax.

BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. stresses that this is not a new tax but merely including the sector in the withholding tax system.

It’s not yet clear how much the BIR expects to collect from this sector but with the proliferation of online sellers, it must be significant.

Will this make up for the taxes collected from POGOs? We’ll have to wait and see.

Taxes collected from POGOs more than doubled to almost P10.3 billion last year although still below the expected P32 billion when the Duterte administration passed the POGO Law in 2021.

From January to May this year, BIR data showed that taxes from POGOs already reached P14 billion – consisting of income, franchise, withholding, documentary and other taxes. This does not yet included license fees and share of the government in gaming revenues.

Will the BIR’s plan to tax online merchants yield billions in taxes, too? As I said, we’ll have to wait and see.

Additionally, the government would have to find new sources to plug the revenue losses that would inevitably appear in the trail of the POGO exit if only to fully realize the benefits of banning the industry.

Office market
Colliers also said the POGO ban is expected to push office vacancy rate to 22 percent by the end of the year from 19.3 percent in 2023. That’s a breach of the 20 percent level.

Thus, Colliers said real estate owners should make strategic adjustments to spaces previously tenanted by POGOs to cushion the impact of the industry’s exit from Metro Manila’s office market.

Colliers said POGOs occupied about 489,000 square meters of office space in Metro Manila as of end-June, or about 3.5 percent of the total office stock, as The STAR’s Richmond Mercurio reported last week.

In the office market universe, this is not that huge, considering that it represents only 3.5 percent of the inventory but whether we like it or not, this would still be significant enough to influence rental rates and related businesses.

Against this backdrop, Colliers said landlords, particularly those with high exposure to POGO tenants, should consider implementing various strategic adjustments.

“These include providing commercial concessions such as lower base rents, tenant improvement allowances and rent-free fit-out periods to make space more marketable to clients,” Colliers said.

Indirect benefits
There are other indirect benefits derived from the POGO sector, as the Department of Finance pointed out. These include compensation to laborers whose disposable income is spent on goods and services that generate economic activities.

DOF estimates the direct and indirect benefits of POGOs amount to roughly P166.49 billion a year.

But as reported by our public finance reporter Louise Maureen Simeon, the DOF’s cost-benefit analysis shows that the costs of POGOs are higher at P265.7 billion.

A huge part of this comes from supposed foregone revenues from investments and tourism due to the negative picture associated with criminal activities of illegal POGOs.

And this is where the Marcos administration needs to do a lot of cleaning up.

Simply banning POGOs does not necessarily mean that criminals and syndicates operating in the Philippines’ labyrinthine underworld will disappear or retire.

Our authorities must seriously investigate and bring to justice perpetrators of money laundering, peddlers of fake birth certificates and possibly, human traffickers. Otherwise such harmful and unspeakable acts will continue to hound us even after the POGO ban.

As what usually happens, syndicates behind organized crime may just lie low for a while until the spotlight dims; they would then reinvent themselves when the dust clears and continue perpetrating their crimes.

More importantly, authorities must keep an eye on illegal operators after the ban. E-sabong, jueteng and other similar activities have long been banned but have they really been fully eradicated?

Industry sources say otherwise.

Thus, authorities must pursue cases against perpetrators of crimes and their coddlers in high places.

Along with these efforts, the government must rid itself of bureaucratic red tape and corruption.

Only then can we send a message to legitimate investors that the Philippines is now a safe and friendly place to do business.

14,Iris Gonzales,"My late grandfather Jorge A. Gonzales, an outstanding individual who lived through World War II, put up a small fleet of jeepneys which served the route between Cubao and the University of the Philippines-Diliman campus.

He did this to help students coming from the Cubao area get to their classes on time.

My grandfather was a UP alumnus so he knew the need for transportation to and from the sprawling campus. When he graduated from the UP College of Law, he went on to practice law but at the same time, put up small businesses, including a barbershop and that fleet of jeepneys.

It complemented the UP Ikot route, which in turn was put up by the pioneer of the UP Ikot, Lolo Neong Odoy, so that students don’t have to walk long distances in between colleges in the 493-hectare campus.

This was during the postbellum era of the late 40s and early 50s, a time of rebuilding and recovering, of standing and helping each other rise from the devastating and paralyzing effects of the Second World War.

Back then, the jeepneys served the citizens well. The jeeps were a surplus from wartime and were sold and resold when the Americans left, paving the way for cheap public transportation for Filipinos.

Fast forward to today and we’re now on the way to phasing out jeepneys.

Is it a wise move?
Perhaps even my grandfather would agree that the jeepney, while it was fit for our roads during the postwar era and in the few decades after, is no longer the best public transportation we can offer Filipino commuters in this day and age. These 5,000-kilogram machines have become outmoded, what with all the changes that came with the times.

Our roads have become too crowded for the jeepneys and our streets too polluted for commuters to endure long rides in an open and exposed vehicle such as the jeepney.

As we develop, we really should provide Filipino commuters better but still affordable mobility options. These include other types of vehicles.

Had the government supported the jeepney manufacturers early on, we wouldn’t be taking this long to modernize our jeepneys. They could have evolved into producers of other types of vehicles under a brand that is truly Filipino. They could have updated the jeepneys to fit with the changing times. But they were always on their own.

But that’s water under the bridge now.

At present, the focus is to push through with PUV modernization.

I believe it’s about time this happens but of course it should not come at the expense of the drivers and other stakeholders who rely on the jeepneys to earn a living.

Transportation Secretary Jaime “JJB” Bautista has submitted a 100-page letter to Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero regarding the suspension of the Public Transportation Modernization Program (PTMP).

This came after senators said they would push for the suspension of the program.

Responding to the different points raised against the program, Sec. JJB stressed that the PTMP does not require PUV operators and drivers to immediately purchase modern PUVs upon consolidation. Instead, PUV modernization will occur gradually over the next three to four years after the consolidation deadline.

“We also want to assure the Senate committee that PNS and greenhouse gas emission-compliant modern jeepney units available on the market are not limited to foreign and imported manufacturers. In fact, modern jeepney units are also produced by well-known local manufacturers,” Bautista said in his letter dated July 29, 2024.

“The DOTr also remains committed to preserving the iconic design of our traditional jeepneys and encourages all local manufacturers and importers of PUVs to emulate the artistic design of traditional PUJs,” he also said.

This measure, Sec. Bautista said, aims to preserve the country’s cultural heritage while adhering to the relevant enforceable PNS or Philippine National Standards.

In his letter, the DOTr chief also warned of the potential effects of suspending PTMP as follows:

• Stakeholder impact. Suspending PTMP at this stage of its implementation could disrupt services for many who depend on its benefits. This could undermine progress and damage relationships with stakeholders, particularly, given that a significant percentage thereof have already consolidated.

• Resource utilization. Further, significant resources have already been invested in developing and implementing the PTMP.

In 2024 alone, the government has already appropriated the amount of P1.6 billion for the program. As it was furthered by the (Senate) committee, the program’s utilization rate is already at 53 percent of the P7.5-billion budget from 2018 to 2024. Suspending the program now risks wasting these investments and incurring additional costs to reestablish similar initiatives in the future.

As of April 30, 2024, the franchise consolidation process has reached 83.38 percent with 159,862 out of the 1919,730 baseline units consolidated. In total, there are 6,090 consolidated routes for PUJs, UVEs (UV Express), minibuses and PUBs (public utility buses), data from DOTr also showed.

Ways forward
In conclusion, Sec. JJB said, “We respectfully beseech the Honorable Senate to consider the ongoing benefits and improvements of PTMP. A temporary suspension might not only halt the positive momentum of the program, but could also have unintended negative consequences.”

Every paradigm shift has its challenges. Not everyone will be happy but the goal is for the changes to benefit the majority and more importantly, for the benefits to outweigh the drawbacks.

15,Iris Gonzales,"It’s a day celebrated not just in Japan but in different parts of the world, hosted by Japanese embassies across the globe.

But here in our country, the celebration of the birthday of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan is always extra special because it combines the best of Japanese hospitality and the warmth of the Filipino, not to mention the gastronomic delight of traditional Japanese cuisine and good servings of polished sake, often prepared together by Japanese and Filipino chefs.

Friday night at the Ty-owned Grand Hyatt Manila was no exception as Ambassador Koshikawa Kazuhiko hosted the annual National Day Reception to celebrate the 64th birthday of His Majesty the Emperor.

Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin graced the event and led the toast in honor of “the health of His Majesty the Emperor, the continued peace and prosperity of the Japanese people and the lasting friendship between the Philippines and Japan.”

It was indeed an evening of friendship, with government officials, lawmakers, tycoons and friends of the Japanese embassy in Manila descending into the glittering ballroom of Grand Hyatt in Taguig, some as early as the sun set in the city.

It was a fitting venue to celebrate a milestone for Japan because, as we all know, the Ty Group has been consistently instrumental in strengthening our country’s ties with Japan through its partnerships with some of the sogo shoshas from the so-called Land of the Rising Sun.

Not surprisingly, the Ty brothers, Arthur and Alfred, dapper in their suits, were there that evening; you can be sure it’s really an important event when Arthur, who isn’t usually seen in big crowds, makes a rare public appearance.

In his speech, Amb. Koshikawa reflected on the dramatic growth of Japan-Philippine relations. He lauded the mutual visit of President Marcos to Japan and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s visit to the Philippines in 2023, emphasizing the significance of these actions in reaffirming friendly relations between the two countries and setting a course for the future.

Economic cooperation
The evening wouldn’t be complete without talking about economic cooperation, and Amb. Koshikawa did just that as he underscored Japan’s commitment to strong economic ties with the Philippines.

A testament to this, he said, are the Japan-backed important infrastructure projects such as the Metro Manila Subway, the North-South Commuter Railway, the Davao Bypass, as well as the Mindanao peace process.

He also raised the importance of security cooperation, mentioning the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) that is under negotiation between Japan and the Philippines and the Official Security Assistance (OSA). RAA is aimed at facilitating cooperation between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Japan Self-Defense Force while OSA is for the provision of coastal radar systems.

Hello Ja-Fun!
Amb. Koshikawa also happily reported that because of a post-pandemic resurgence of tourism, the number of Filipinos going to Japan reached a record high last year.

There were 622,268 Filipinos who went to Japan, exceeding the pre-pandemic figures of 613,114 recorded in 2019, according to data from the Japan National Tourism Organization.

VIPs who filled the stage for the toast included House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Charles John Brown.

Also spotted that night were former prime minister Cesar Virata, Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity Carlito Galvez and members of the diplomatic community.

Tycoons, businessmen and executives also took time out of their busy schedules to join the festivities. Aside from the Ty brothers, I also saw Cecilio Pedro, founder of Lamoiyan Corp., the company behind the popular Hapee toothpaste brand; Edgard Cabangon, chairman of ALC Group of Companies and Yoji Kawaguchi, president of Mitsukoshi Federal Retail Inc.

New Toyota Philippines prexy
Just as I was chatting with Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP) chairman Alfred Ty, whom I congratulated for Grand Hyatt’s successful hosting of the event that night and the official turnover of the TMP presidency, newly appointed TMP president Masando Hashimoto walks by.

At last, I had the opportunity to finally congratulate Hashimoto because I wasn’t able to talk to him during the turnover ceremony held in the same glittering ballroom just a few days ago.

Hashimoto assumed leadership from Atsuhiro Okamato, who in turn, described his tenure in the Philippines as his most memorable, what with the Pinatubo eruption and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Going back to the Friday’s Japan National Day celebration, there were many other notable guests but one who stood out was the indefatigable and energetic Ramon S. Ang or RSA who arrived just as the program was about to start.

In no time, RSA was swarmed by well-wishers – including a rival bidder – congratulating him for his recent victory in the Ninoy Aquino International Airport bidding.

But it was not only his NAIA win that earned him praises, but also for Gilas Pilipinas’ landslide win against Hong Kong in the recent FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers.

That night, everyone wanted a minute of RSA’s time and he gave it. He was really visibly happy with what seems to be an alignment of stars for San Miguel Corp., the diversified conglomerate that he leads.

Overall, Japan’s National Day reception in the Philippines was a lovely evening not just to celebrate the oldest monarchy in the world, but to mark the good friendship it has built with other countries, including ours, through the years.

I, too, offer my warmest felicitations to Japan on its special day.",0
16,Iris Gonzales,"This time of the year between Christmas and New Year is a Dead Week of sorts, when homes are a bit quiet compared to the frantic schedule the whole year round; cities are less crowded and some families are out on vacation.

Society is on a pause of sorts and people don’t really want to do much or accomplish anything, resigned to the fact that what’s done is done.

It’s also a good time to take stock of the year that would soon be over.

Now how can we talk about 2023 without discussing politics and how it took centerstage for the most part of the year?

While both camps are denying it to the high heavens, it’s obvious that the much touted UniTeam Alliance, the electoral alliance between the Marcos and Duterte camps, is now a thing of the past.

And we’re of course treated to a ringside view of the conflict, as gripping and as tense as a Manny Pacquiao boxing fight.

I say treated because, admit or not, here in our Republic of Marites, we love being spectators in our dirty political arena. If, as Marx said, religion is the opium of the masses, politics, no doubt, is the opiate of the rest of the population.

And as I said, what a gripping boxing match it has been or still is.

There’s the House of Representatives’ successful move to strip Vice President Sara Duterte’s offices of confidential funds.

Rody Duterte came to the rescue of his daughter Sara, saying with all certainty that the realignment was politically motivated and related to the 2028 presidential polls where President Marcos’ cousin and House Speaker Martin Romualdez and the Vice President are perceived as frontrunners.

And then there’s Sara Duterte recently criticizing President Marcos for reopening peace talks with communist rebels in what marks as her first major public rebuttal of the President and his administration’s policies.

And then there’s the move of the House against Sonshine Media Network International whose program hosts have used their platform to red-tag activists and some media organizations. I don’t agree with the revocation of the franchise but I agree that the network should be investigated for all the fake news and red-tagging it has unleashed. Changes must be implemented.

Silver lining
There is a silver lining in all these moves. At last, past actions of the Duterte administration are now being rectified.

Clearly, the Dutertes’ unparalleled arrogance was no match for the stars that aligned at the House. Suddenly progressive lawmakers and the powers-that-be have become strange bedfellows. Ah, welcome to our land of the bizarre.

Bad news is that this is happening largely because of politics and as I said earlier, policy changes that are motivated by politics may not really be sustainable.

It would have been better if accountability and justice were the primary motivations to correct misdeeds of past administrations.

My fearless forecast is this politicking will continue throughout the new year.

Social concerns
We can only hope our policymakers and lawmakers won’t be so distracted that they forget there are a lot of pressing social concerns – from the worsening crisis in education to low economic productivity to food security, not to mention a possible resurgence of COVID-19.

As the recent GlobalSource report by former central bank deputy governor Diwa Guinigundo and Wilhelmina Mañalac noted, the latest Business Expectations Survey showed that Philippine businesses remained modestly positive in their outlook for the current quarter compared to the previous quarter as measured through the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Confidence Index. The index was up by only 0.1 percentage point in Q4 2023 (35.9) compared to Q3 (35.8).

There is tempered optimism, no thanks to the negative effect of the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, inflation and higher interest rates.

Thus, next year could be an even more difficult year if the downside risks to the economy such as higher inflation and lack of jobs materialize.

GlobalSource has likewise warned: “We doubt whether the government has a solution to the prolonged El Niño dry spell next year using better rice production technology.”

“This is one of the tasks cut out for the new economic czar Frederick Go – to orchestrate the deployment of public policy to mitigate pressing social concerns, not the least of which is attaining food security within the context of sustained economic growth,” it also said.

There is so much to do indeed and I hope our uncanny politics does not get in the way.

There’s only the whole of 2024 to get as many critical reforms as possible done because by 2025, our politicos will be busy preparing for the midterm elections.

What I fervently hope to see are more actions, not early campaign photo-ops; more reforms and less politicking; more policy changes for the better and less graft and corruption; more jobs for Filipinos, not just investment pledges.

As it is now, this country’s institutions have been bastardized and co-opted by selfish and self-serving politicians and corrupted to the core.

But all is not lost.

Hope springs eternal, as I always say. This is etched in my heart like a tattoo because I believe in it as much as I believe in our country and our people’s full potential.

But we all need to believe in it and demand for the changes that we deserve so that someday soon, our beloved home country will finally be the great nation that it should be.",0
17,Iris Gonzales,"In today’s newsrooms, says tycoon Manuel V. “MVP” Pangilinan, the title of “editor” is perhaps the most inaccurate.

Why so? MVP argues:

Publishers publish, reporters report and journalists work on journals. One would think that all editors do is edit.

“But your jobs – as you know – are far more important, and much more intensive than marking up your writers’ drafts. You have perhaps the most crucial job of all – which is choosing what to focus on, and deciding what the news is,” he says.

Brave new world
This is particularly important, MVP says, as he recognized the existence of artificial intelligence and its curatorial influence on information via algorithms.

But this doesn’t mean the job of the editor has become obsolete, he says.

“In fact, you are all more valuable than ever before. In cyberspace where answers are available everywhere, you determine which questions are worth asking,” says the tycoon during a recent gathering of news editors organized by the MVP Group.

Perhaps MVP, the chairman and CEO of the many companies he leads, is also well aware that consumption has changed drastically.

The same is true in the news. The way people consume news today and the way news affects the world, have significantly changed.

As MVP says, it’s a time when what confronts us is something in the mold of English author Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel, Brave New World where, the tycoon notes, “people are flooded with so much information that it’s impossible to distinguish what’s important from what’s not.”

The greatest weapons against such a threat are news editors, MVP says.

It’s one of those times when MVP, whose sprawling business empire includes stakes – big or small – in media organizations, puts the spotlight on the people who sift through the dizzying avalanche of stories every single day and decide which ones would have the biggest impact on the lives of Filipinos.

KathNiel
Times indeed are changing. Who would have thought for instance that KathNiel fans would have a collective breakdown after Filipino celebrity couple Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla announced their split after 11 years of being young lovers on-screen and off-screen?

At least one local newspaper put it on the front page, perhaps to acknowledge this heartbreak of millions of Filipinos. Television news programs interrupted their regular hard news to announce the break-up. The Singapore Straits Times carried a story about it.

Were newspapers correct in giving so much prominence to the KathNiel breakup?

At best, it was a recognition that a great big part of the Filipino population were in tears.

Perhaps, sometimes, sifting through news isn’t always about looking for stories that would make people less hungry or more hungry. It’s also about recognizing stories that affect – momentarily or otherwise – the Filipino people’s soul, something AI can’t figure out just yet.

Perhaps, it’s no coincidence that MVP reminded us about Huxley’s Brave New World, which warned against a society devoid of deep connections that make us truly human and alive.

More imported meat from Brazil
Speaking of hard news and gut issues, some recent news from Brazil caught my attention.

Brazil, the world’s top chicken exporter and home to giant meatpackers, announced in early November that it was extending an avian flu-related national health emergency for another 180 days due to more detections of the virus.

The South American country has confirmed avian flu cases in wild birds as early as May 2023 and declared a health emergency a week later.

Just last Nov. 7, Brazil announced that it was extending the national health emergency, Reuters has reported.

Japan had imposed a temporary ban on Brazilian chicken products coming from Espirito Santo state in late June and from Santa Catarina, Brazil’s second largest producer and exporter of chicken, in mid-July.

Although Brazil said the highly infectious virus has not yet reached commercial flocks, it has 139 confirmed outbreaks of the disease, including in wild birds, subsistence poultry and mammals, the Reuters report also said.

Against this backdrop, I’m curious why the Philippines wants to pave the way for more meat imports from Brazil.

The South American country is seeking system-wide accreditation that will allow its establishments to export animals, meat and meat products to the Philippines.

Thus, in a special order last month, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said he is sending an inspection mission to Brazil for the accreditation of Brazilian foreign meat establishments.

Normally, this is just a standard procedure. When countries want to export meat and meat products to the Philippines, they need to apply for systemwide accreditation which would entail actual inspection of their animal health and safety standards.

But there are many factors at play here. Why do we want to bring in more meat imports at this time and from a country with confirmed cases of avian flu?

Brazil’s meat products such as beef, pork or chicken parts could directly compete with Filipino farmers who are already struggling.

As it is now, mechanically deboned meat or those used to make products such as sausage, nuggets, luncheon meat, etc. already enjoy a two-year, five percent tariff rate which exporters are currently enjoying. The Marcos administration has extended the lower tariffs to end-2024.

Imports help ensure the continued supply of food products in the country at affordable prices but as I’ve said before, we must also make sure that our local industries get enough support.",0
18,Iris Gonzales,"After more than a year and after several other names cropped up in the business grapevine, at last we finally have an agriculture secretary.

Newly appointed Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. will be racing against time because of the enormity of the work that needs to be done – from ensuring food security to addressing specific problems of our local industries.

This early, there are already some hiccups – expected of course – including the fact that he did not graduate from the University of Santo Tomas despite official documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying so. (Congratulations to campus journalists from The Varsitarian for putting the spotlight on this).

Hiccups aside, I hope he will be able to improve a sector that was once upon a time, our country’s pride, hope and source of economic growth.

It’s a challenging task for sure and one must be a bit crazy to accept the agriculture post especially in these hard times. But then again, sometimes the crazy are the ones who get things done. We’ll see about that.

My hope is that he would be open to huge changes in the present structure of the Department of Agriculture and work closely with people on the ground – the farmers, the fisherfolk, the local government units.

As I said before, the present structure of the agriculture department is from the top down wherein plans and programs emanate from the top with hardly any consultation from those on the ground and implemented in a one-size-fits all manner. This isn’t always effective because different regions have different problems.

Sec. Laurel can change this by working closely with the different LGUs because they are the ones who are in touch with the farmers. The farmers know and listen to the LGUs’ provincial agriculture and municipal officers, as former agriculture undersecretary Dr. Cristino “Resty” Collado pointed out.

This could help a lot in determining how to allocate food production budget, say the rice production budget, for example. Those in the top 10 rice producing regions should be prioritized while top performers can be rewarded with a higher budget from the DA.

Rice
In the food hierarchy, three major commodities must be tackled properly – rice, meat and sugar, as I said before.

Rice is top in the hierarchy, the mainstay in every Filipino meal.

Sec. Laurel would have to create an effective partnership with farmers to boost rice productivity. This, in turn, can be done with the DA and the different LGUs working together.

For example, the local chieftains can distribute seeds and fertilizer directly to the target. They can identify which areas need to be prioritized the most.

Pork, chicken

Next in the food hierarchy is pork. Whether we like it or not, healthy or otherwise, we are such a meat eating country.

Welcome to this lechon republic!

Indeed, meat products, mainly pork and chicken, are the usual food items that most Filipinos complement with rice.

Also, the price of pork is the lead barometer used to plan for family food budgets. Prices of poultry and fish follow when prices of pork go up.

Speaking of meat, we are also having problems with cheap imports.

Industry sources have said that a lot of meat products have been kept in cold storage facilities for months on end.

Normally, this is allowed but in recent months, there have been numerous reports of some of these meat products stored far too long and no longer fit for consumption yet are finding their way into stores and wet markets in the country without any information on their expiry or production dates.

The least the government can do is to make sure that every product sold to consumers is properly labeled.

Raids by the DA months ago and industry monitoring from local producers have shown that tubs and tubs of unbranded and spoiled chicken products are sold in some wet markets such as those in Bulacan and Caloocan.

There are even reports that a cold storage operator in northern Luzon buys imported meat products – some of which may be expired – and sells these goods to food kiosks selling chickens, dumplings, etc. This is a horror story, if true.

The DA must be vigilant and must look into these reports that’s been going around the industry.

Data from the Bureau of Animal Industry showed that the country bought 289.52 million kilograms of chicken overseas in the first eight months of the year, 35.4 percent higher compared to the 244.8 million a year ago.

Not surprisingly, our local meat producers are hurting.

Sugar
And then there’s the bitter situation surrounding our sugar industry, which is now on the brink of extinction due to neglect and our obsession with imports.

Importing goods of course is always the more convenient route because these goods are cheaper.

But there’s always the issue of smuggling and poor quality of imported food, especially meat products.

The different problems surrounding our top commodities point to a common solution and that is to increase local production. This is of course easier said than done and may not be the fastest solution.

But for the sake of our farmers, producers and for our own food security, we must do it.

How we get there under Sec. Laurel’s leadership remains to be seen. Would he be able to strike that delicate balance between ensuring affordable food prices and strengthening local production?

I hope we find out soon enough.",0
19,Iris Gonzales,"The P48-billion budget overrun reported by telco giant PLDT marks another chapter in its long, colorful and winding history – 94 years and counting.

It’s a major development for the country’s oldest and largest telecommunications giant and even PLDT chairman Manuel V. “MVP” Pangilinan’s arowana knows it.

MVP shared on Twitterverse on Monday that his arowana died, a death which feng shui believers consider a “noble sacrifice.”

Indeed, many believe that when an arowana dies, it is often a noble sacrifice that takes away the bad luck or misfortune that has befallen a household or perhaps a business.

“Probably absorbed all the angst of PLDT on our behalf,” MVP said.

Often called the “dragon fish” because its metallic coin-like scales undulate like the paper dragons we see during Chinese New Year, the arowana has spawned the belief that the fish brings good luck and prosperity. It’s no surprise it’s a favorite among Asian elite.

True or not, one thing is clear. Investors are waiting with bated breath for the result of PLDT’s internal investigation on the budget overrun.

Impairment
As I write this, PLDT is set to talk to investors and analysts. Reporters covering the beat are staking out. By the time this column comes out, PLDT may have already clarified the issues. It said last week that it has not uncovered fraudulent transactions or procurement anomalies.

Even MVP’s business rival Ramon “RSA” Ang, who knows the nature of a telco business, believes it was unlikely that the overrun was due to fraud.

It was not ‘mathematically possible’ to defraud a company of P48 billion, Ang said.

Instead, it may have been more of an impairment issue arising from some – and expensive – telco network equipment that may have been acquired but was not used as intended or did not deliver on its intended use. This might have been largely due to tech factors such as becoming obsolete or being no longer applicable in certain areas by the time the different types of equipment were delivered.

RSA noted that in the telco business, this can happen because there are many moving parts and technology changes in the wink of an eye. Thus, what may be applicable or needed today may no longer be useful tomorrow.

Another source said the P48 billion refers to equipment already in use that was not yet officially accepted. Thus it is not yet recorded in the books of PLDT. This means they aren’t depreciated yet in accounting terms.

The source said that “if you use the average life of ten years,” depreciation would have reduced the operating income by P4.8 billion a year and about P3.6 billion after tax.

Ambulance chasers
Ambulance chasers have already smelled blood. News from the US showed that US law firms are urging affected investors to file a complaint against the telco giant.

We will now have to wait and see what happens next, including the results of the inquiry of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Everyone is waiting with bated breath.

What is clear for now is that this development will certainly mark a major chapter in PLDT’s long, corporate history.

Philippine Airlines sees milestone profit year

Over at another company, Philippine Airlines, the country’s flag carrier, is reaping the benefits of the travel industry’s recovery.

PAL expects to record a milestone profit year for 2022, thanks to revenge travel.

In a recent chat, PAL president and COO Capt. Stanley Ng  said almost all routes are back to pre-pandemic levels except China, which only just started to ease COVID-19 related curbs.

For the third quarter of the year, PAL registered an operating income of P4.9 billion and comprehensive income of P4.2 billion.

This brought nine-month income to P11.5 billion and the comprehensive income to P8.3 billion, signifying the continuing resurgence of the Philippines’ only full-service network airline amid the ongoing recovery of air travel and tourism.

But Capt. Stanley said there’s still a lot of work to be done to sustain growth.

These include further improving PAL’s customer service, adding more flights and opening new routes.

PAL just opened a new route between Cebu and Baguio City last Dec. 16, marking PAL’s comeback to Baguio, the very first destination it served nearly 82 years ago.

“So we are happy to be flying back to where it all started,” Capt. Stanley said.

PAL to Europe
PAL may also return to Europe by 2025, “an aspirational target,” he said during our chat, just days after he arrived from Brussels where he joined President Marcos in a meeting with Brussels Airport CEO Arnaud Feist.

This happened at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-European Union (ASEAN-EU) Commemorative Summit last week.

Last mile
PAL wingwoman Cielo Villaluna also shared with me that PAL will soon have a last mile shipping service, which will be a game changer for the cargo industry and would be beneficial to Filipinos, especially in this age of speedy deliveries.

Things indeed are looking up for PAL but as Capt. Stanley said, the flag carrier still has a lot of room for improvement.

I’ve been on a few PAL flights recently and I have no issues. I even raved about the excellent in-flight food from Manila to New York but I continue to hear a lot of horror stories from other passengers – from lost baggage to delayed flights to the long wait for their bags at the conveyor belt.

May all these problems be resolved sooner than later so that Filipinos and visitors alike can truly enjoy traveling, whether for business or pleasure.",0
20,Iris Gonzales,"The sun is out, the storm has passed. The Paeng-induced bedlam has died down at least for now. It’s business as usual again at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), the country’s main gateway.

The past few days, however, a different kind of mayhem descended into the airport; of how a new general manager has been appointed, surprising NAIA insiders and the whole industry.

But as I write this piece on this sunny Monday morning, I’m told that it’s still business as usual at the airport after all, despite news of a new Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) general manager.

Transportation Secretary Jaime “JJB” Bautista also confirmed to me that it’s another day at work for MIAA general manager Cesar Chiong.

“It’s business as usual,” Sec. JJB said.

This is good news, some airport insiders said. Many of them are happy with GM Chiong’s leadership style.

“He is doing very well. Everyone is inspired to work. His style of management is that of the private sector,” one insider shared with me.

By private sector-like leadership style, they meant that GM Chiong is professional, listens to everyone and makes a decision based on what is best for all.

Sec. JJB said the same thing. Even members of the board of directors of MIAA have been actively participating in meetings now, just like in the boardrooms of private corporations, he said.

GM Chiong is a veteran aviation executive with at least 30 years experience with Philippine Airlines, Air Philippines and in San Miguel Corp. prior to joining the government, said Sec. JJB, who handpicked him for MIAA.

Reforms
He has been instituting reforms and has been going after those with unpaid financial obligations to the airport, insiders said. The money was meant to finance improvements such as in the different terminals and in digitizing airport processes.

These efforts may have ruffled some feathers who might have lobbied for leadership changes in MIAA, sources said.

Snake pit
This shouldn’t be the case, really. Serving in government shouldn’t feel like being in a snake pit and that you could lose your job any moment.

Unfortunately, it seems the most uncertain job positions these days – as uncertain as in Elon Musk’s Twitter – are in government.

How many ranking Palace officials have had to leave for unclear reasons the past months? Is this a reflection of the supposed power play among the different groups in this administration?

I heard there are eight power blocks surrounding the President. If true, they put the PNoy-era Samar and Balay rivalry to shame.

Gods of NAIA
On a serious note, I hope to see the continuation of reforms in our airports, especially in NAIA, the country’s most important gateway. If GM Chiong is seriously fixing the problems including weeding out money-making syndicates, then let this continue.

There are a lot of changes that need to be implemented to improve airport operations. Otherwise, we will continue to experience mayhem whenever there are calamities or extraordinary situations such as holidays, which are peak seasons for traveling.

GM Chiong has a lot more to do to improve airport operations. I wrote about the Paeng-related mess two weeks ago. Six years won’t be enough to implement lasting changes in the airport but if we keep changing the leadership in the middle of reforms, we would just be going around in circles.

Many of our longtime airport officials and rank-and-file workers are smart, hardworking and sincere civil servants. They deserve a competent leader.

Controversial positions such as airport GMs should never be politicized. In fact, anyone trying to reform our gateways – or any government agency for that matter – by weeding out money-making syndicates or the so-called Gods of NAIA should have the full backing of the President.

These syndicates have been getting their way for decades now. Isn’t this the reason why past private sector attempts to take over the operations and management of NAIA – even with the combined strength of seven of the country’s biggest conglomerates – never prospered?

At the end of the day, without improvements in our airports, it is the traveling public who will continue to suffer. More often than not, when we fly in and fly out, we experience chaos in our airports.

While fixing NAIA, we should also have a new and alternative gateway.

Bulacan Airport
Sec. JJB shared with me that during the weekend, he and his team also inspected the progress of the New Manila International Airport or the Bulacan International Airport of San Miguel Corp.

There’s been significant progress, says Sec. JJB, referring to the massive dredging works on the site of the airport and he is excited. I hope that indeed we will finally see a new and alternative gateway in the years to come. We needed a new airport yesterday.

Home
I dream to see the day when we can all pass through a gateway that is among the best in the world, one that is consistently efficient and excellent; one that is comfortable and convenient for each and every passenger and not just for Business Class or VIP travelers; one that will give us an enjoyable experience between flights; one that isn’t just business as usual but so much better.

The airport is that last thing we see when we depart and the first thing that welcomes us when we come home.

Passing through it shouldn’t feel like walking the gauntlet but should feel like a piece of home, as if we’re back in the warm embrace of a loved one.",0
21,Maria A. Ressa,"Those with power and money must choose. Ask yourselves these questions: Who are you? What do you stand for? What kind of world do you want in the next decade?'
The following speech was delivered by Rappler CEO Maria Ressa on Sunday, May 2, after receiving the 2021 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.

Thank you so much to UNESCO, the independent jury, the more than 80 press freedom and news organizations who have helped us hold the line. This is for Rappler and all Filipino journalists who – despite the increased risks just to be able to do our jobs – continue to hold power to account. It’s also a reflection of how the world looks at the Duterte administration today and the death by a thousand cuts of our democracy happening in front of our eyes.

I wish I were with you today in Namibia, but I’m in Manila, prevented from traveling by court order – which I continue to fight as State-led legal attacks are waged against me on multiple fronts. I also can’t travel because my nation is suffering the consequences of putting retired military generals in charge of a public health crisis – when political patronage and loyalty, not competence, is the metric of power.

This is a time when lies and incompetence kill.

In less than two years, the Philippine government filed 10 arrest warrants against me.

In 2017, government propagandists tried to trend the hashtag #ArrestMariaRessa. They failed, but they kept at it, and two years later, I was arrested – twice – in a little more than a month. They violated my rights when they prevented me from posting bail and detained me overnight. I suppose they wanted me to shake and feel their power.

To the budding dictators of this world, if you have to abuse your power to make you feel powerful, you’re not powerful – just abusive and small.

What I and other truth-tellers in the Philippines have lived through has given us firsthand experience of how the law and law enforcement have been turned against our people. Now more than ever, power and money rule.

In 2016, 4 months after Duterte became president, Rappler and I wrote investigative pieces showing you how the first casualty in our nation’s battle for truth is the number of people killed in our brutal drug war. That violence was facilitated and fueled by American social media companies. Based on big data analysis, we reported the networks that were manipulating us online, targeting and attacking truth-tellers, pounding to silence anyone challenging power, which created an extensive social media propaganda machine.

Five years ago, we demanded an end to impunity on two fronts: Duterte’s drug war and Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook. Today, it has only gotten worse – and Silicon Valley’s sins came home to roost on January 6 with mob violence on Capitol Hill.

What happens on social media doesn’t stay on social media.

Online violence leads to real world violence.

Since 2016, I have felt like Sisyphus and Cassandra combined, repeatedly warning that our dystopian present is your future. American biologist EO Wilson said it best: we’re facing paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology.

Social media, with its highly profitable micro targeting, has become a behavior modification system, and we are Pavlov’s dogs experimented on in real time – with disastrous consequences. Facebook is the world’s largest distributor of news, and yet studies have shown that lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and further than really boring facts. The social media platforms that deliver the facts to you are biased against facts, biased against journalists, biased against meaningful conversations. They are – by design – dividing us and radicalizing us. This is not a free speech issue. It’s not the fault of its users. These platforms are not merely mirroring humanity. They are making all of us our worst selves, creating emergent behavior that feeds on violence, fear, uncertainty, and enabling the rise of fascism.

Think of it like this.

Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without trust, we have no shared reality, and it becomes impossible to deal with our world’s existential problems: the coronavirus, climate, the atom bomb that exploded in our information ecosystem when journalists lost gatekeeping powers to technology companies. Tech abdicated responsibility for the public sphere and couldn’t seem to fathom that information is a public good.

Women, people of color, the LGBTQ, those already marginalized become even more vulnerable as you’ll see in the UNESCO report “The Chilling” whose lead author, ICFJ’s Julie Posetti, convinced me to speak up when my attacks began many years ago. Of course, there’s a cost to speaking truth to power.

On Christmas Eve two years ago, Amal Clooney sent me an email. Until then, no one had really had the time to go through the many ludicrous charges I’m facing and their penalties. Turns out I could go to jail for the rest of my life. By her last count – on paper – it was more than a hundred years in prison. So I dealt with the sinking feeling in my stomach – this is my lawyer telling me that, right? I took away a lesson: don’t open an email from Amal on Christmas Eve! Sometimes you just have to laugh.

Believe it or not, I’m lucky. When you’re the target of attacks you’re the only one who sees it all, but you can also see exactly how the tactics change. Knowledge is power. And because I spent two decades of my career outside the Philippines, the international community knows me, the quality of my work, my values, my work ethic.

So many others aren’t so lucky.

Like 35-year-old Ritchie Nepomuceno, who accused the police of extortion, torture, and rape. She was one of at least 3 Filipino women who filed charges against 11 policemen who they said held them inside a secret room at a police station. Less than two weeks ago on April 19, Ritchie was walking down the street when she was shot and killed.

Human rights activist Zara Alvarez and another colleague were set to testify against the government and the military. She went as far as asking for court protection, which was at first denied, and is still on appeal. Last August, she was walking home with her dinner – she had just bought it – when she was shot and killed. So was her colleague. No one is left to testify. I could go on.

Now let’s go to the journalists.

Frenchie Mae Cumpio, still in jail, celebrated her 22nd birthday in prison. Arrested and jailed more than a year ago, it is a familiar tactic: get an arrest warrant; do a raid; then charge with possession of illegal firearms and explosives, a non-bailable offense.

That’s also what happened to Lady Ann Salem, another young journalist. Arrested last December, Salem said the police planted evidence in her apartment, but another judge voided her arrest warrant. It still took time before she was released, forcing her to spend 3 months in prison during a pandemic. 

Because she’s a journalist.

It’s not a coincidence that these victims are women. This February, Senator Leila de Lima, whom Amnesty International calls a prisoner of conscience, began her 5th year in prison. She calls it lawfare – when law is used as a weapon to silence anyone questioning power. The cuts to democracy are bleeding. They’re overwhelming and can’t be ignored.

Last year, two days, just two days after World Press Freedom Day, Filipino lawmakers, nudged by President Duterte, shut down ABS-CBN, once our largest broadcasting network, our largest news group, also headed by a female journalist. Thousands lost their jobs.

Around the same time that Hong Kong passed its draconian security law, the Philippines passed an anti-terror law that sparked 37 petitions at the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional. Under that law, anyone some Cabinet secretaries call a terrorist could be arrested without a warrant and jailed for up to 24 days. Here’s one last fact: more lawyers have died under the Duterte administration than in the 44 years before he took office.

So here’s the thing: our problems can’t be solved from the Philippines alone. Again, something I’ve said repeatedly: what’s local is global; and what’s global is local.

As we face the coronavirus, there’s an equally dangerous and insidious virus of lies unleashed in our information ecosystem. It’s seeded by power wanting to stay in power, spread by algorithms motivated, created for profit, a business model Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. The reward is your attention, and all this is linked to geopolitical power play. Last week, the EU slammed Russia and China for their intensified vaccine disinformation campaigns. Last September, Facebook took down information operations from China that were campaigning for the daughter of Duterte for president – next year, our presidential elections – that network was creating fake accounts for US elections, and it was attacking me.

The virus of lies is highly contagious. They infect real people, who become impervious to facts. It changes the way they look at the world. They become angrier, more isolated. They distrust everything.

In this environment, the dictator wins, crumbling our democracies from within.

I became a journalist 35 years ago when people power in the Philippines helped spark democracy movements around the world. I had the great privilege of reporting on much of Southeast Asia’s transition from one-man authoritarian rule to democracy. 

Inevitably, there is this one moment when power and money chooses – status quo or change: in the Philippines in 1986, it was an elite family’s banner at a protest rally that helped open the floodgates that ousted a dictator. In Indonesia in 1998, months of student protests led nowhere until the business community and the military stepped in, ending nearly 32 years of Suharto.

Those with power and money must choose.

Ask yourselves these questions: Who are you? What do you stand for? What kind of world do you want in the next decade?

The more you have, the more you must risk.

Because silence is complicity.

Whether you’re at the UN or heading a nation or a corporation, or you’re a politician, human rights worker, a journalist, or a citizen, fight – and win – your individual battle for integrity.

At stake is our collective global future.

Please act now.

Courage ON. Thank you.",0
22,Maria A. Ressa,"He calls his protocol 'SDS' – sanitize, disinfect, sterilize
Business owners have to put their people – and their customers – first. 

Going to get a haircut in our science-fiction world can be an adventure, but when I walked into the Basement Salon at SM Aura, I had a new appreciation for details – noticing how the pens were individually sterilized, the counter top wiped down with Clorox sheets, and how contact tracing was automated with each of us getting a pre-printed sheet with our name on it.

I couldn’t help but ask the owner/manager Michael Webb about his systems, and we compared notes. 

We at Rappler have been extra cautious, putting in place protocols and systems, digging into research, estimating costs. Last March, we began to keep an Excel spreadsheet of everyone’s temperatures, with our managers checking their teams and families. 

I do love learning about how to adapt, and I think Michael’s journey and choices give us a path forward. He came home to help his family business, leaving behind a VP post with a semiconductor company in the US. Those corporate processes and thinking helped infuse his choices, but it’s inevitably his values that dictated his path. 

Working in California, Michael was steeped in the HIV battle and in legislation that was introduced by his father, former senator Freddie Webb. Since a salon is a high contact business, Michael put in place systems to deal with HIV and hepatitis. He said it was only a hop-skip-and-a-jump to use those systems for COVID-19. Looking at his software, he showed how he could go back 3-4 years and know exactly which staff members interacted with each customer.

As I was getting my haircut, I saw that he had separated us into clusters, with staff moving from customers in a systematic manner. Again, easier for contact tracing!

Some highlights from our chat below:

Webb describes 3 protocols he put in place for HIV and hepatitis, which he has adapted to the coronavirus: “There are 3 basic hygiene protocols. The first is you sanitize, which is cleaning. Then you introduce another product, which is a disinfectant. Then the third one is when you render an object inert, which is when you sterilize.” 
Every tool used by his staffers are divided into 3 categories: non-critical, semi-critical, critical: “The ones that are critical are defined as those having a higher percentage of actually piercing skin.”
He calls his protocol “SDS” – sanitize, disinfect, sterilize.
Instead of wearing full PPEs, his staffers wear cotton lab coats. The salon has a steamer, and after each customer, the staffer’s outer garments are steamed, a more effective way, Webb said studies show, than keeping one plastic PPE in place all day.
Webb follows the findings for disinfectants of the US Environmental Protection Agency. He gives us some of what he’s found, including what disinfectants he uses and where.
For his staff, it’s a constant education. Keeping them updated about what he reads, his processes. He also has in place a testing process for his staff, and always emphasizes that the best way is to be aware of where they go and what they do. 
While his salon is ready for Christmas, he says he is preparing for New Year’s Eve, and he shares some of the processes he is thinking about adapting, given that he cannot control all the moves of his staff during the holidays. 

So for him, that most likely means increased testing. He drops a tidbit: the best time to test is 3 days after a potential infection. 

Watch our conversation here.

I asked him about advice he would give to families for the holidays, and he was categorical: 1) Wear a mask and a face shield; 2) Be careful. Avoid going out if you don’t have to. If you want to go to a restaurant, order in; 3) Be hygienic, but avoid overkill at home. 

To Webb, it is about knowing and understanding the coronavirus, and accepting that you have a responsibility not only to yourself and your family, but to your neighbors too.

“I am responsible for my clients and my people. That’s how I feel,” said Webb. “I don’t want to look back and say, ‘I should have, you know, I could have…’ I would rather say, ‘I did the best I could.’”",0
23,Maria A. Ressa,"Information operations are manipulating Filipinos online, but finally, Facebook is doing something to stop that
 

Editor’s Note: The original version of this piece was commissioned and first published online by Time Magazine on January 17, 2019, as part of its series on Facebook and its global impact. This is reposted with permission. 

For a time, my reputation – and peace of mind – was demolished by information operations on Facebook. It’s a cautionary tale for the United States.

I run Rappler, an online news site in the Philippines. In my country, Facebook essentially is the internet, thanks to subsidies from telecommunications companies that let people avoid data charges while on the site. But it has also made the Philippines a showcase for the destruction Facebook can enable.

The attacks against me and Rappler began appearing on Facebook in the summer of 2016. A year later President Rodrigo Duterte was repeating them in his State of the Nation Address. I have since been indicted on politically-motivated criminal charges, faced my first arrest warrant, and posted bail. Not just once, but 5 times in two separate courts. I need permission to travel outside the Philippines.

If I lose these tax evasion cases and others filed by the Philippine government, I could go to jail for 10 to 15 years.

All because I – and Rappler, the startup I helped create, 7 years old this month – continue to hold power to account, to do our jobs as journalists, and to #HoldTheLine against impunity in a drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people, according to human rights groups.

We know first-hand how social media and the law has been weaponized against perceived critics of the Duterte administration. We’ve been reporting on it from the start. 

In early October 2016, Rappler published a 3-part series on social media propaganda. It analyzed the emerging information ecosystem using what researchers later called “patriotic trolling” – online, state-sponsored hate meant to silence or intimidate specific targets. After the exposé appeared, I received an average of 90 hate messages per hour for the next month. 

The attacks on Facebook are insidious and extremely personal, from the way I look and sound to threats of rape and murder. As a former war zone correspondent, I have been in the line of fire, but nothing prepared me for this.

After all, a lie repeated a million times becomes the truth, shaping and conditioning public opinion, seeding the messages that would be repeated by President Duterte himself: that Rappler is CIA, fake news, owned by Americans, many more. It hits me every time I look back because these lies form the basis of some of the legal cases against us.

This is our daily pressure cooker: attacked from below by cheap armies on social media, and from above by President Duterte and the government.

The effort was extremely well organized. Each of the government propaganda machine’s 3 main content creators addressed a different slice of society: Sass Sasot created pseudo-intellectual content for the top 1%; Thinking Pinoy (RJ Nieto) targeted the middle class; and singer-dancer turned government official now congressional candidate Mocha Uson riled up the mass base. As early as 2016, an #UnfollowRappler campaign activated at least 52,000 accounts. That was about 1% of our followers at that time – but consider that an earlier investigation showed us that 26 fake accounts on Facebook could reach up to 3 million others.

What mayhem could more than 50,000 Facebook accounts create?

They can reverse perceptions, splitting the real world from the social media world.

We saw it happen. In January 2018, the Pew Global Attitudes Survey found 86% of Filipinos out in the physical world said they trusted traditional news media. If you live on social media, though, your perception was nearly the complete opposite: 83% distrusted it, according to the Philippine Trust Index released that same month. It happened from systematic and exponentially growing attacks on traditional media, which clearly escalated after Duterte took office in June 2016. In the year before the election campaign, the language Duterte used to attack the media – bias(ed) and corrupt or “bayaran” – barely registered in Facebook comments or posts. Afterward, bias came up 2,000 times a day, and bayaran one day approached 4,000. (For example in one day, bias had an unnaturally high, boosted peak of 30,000 comments.) The attacks pounded fracture lines in society repeatedly until perception was made reality.  These attacks fuel anger and hate to tear down trust in truth-tellers: journalists, human rights advocates; to maintain high approval ratings for President Duterte; and to change the values of a significant chunk of our society who now say it’s okay to kill drug users or to let China have portions of Philippine territory in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea). The attacks wage war against opposition politicians, manipulate the Filipino public, and weaken our democracy.

Rappler knows the best and the worst of what Facebook can do. As the world’s largest distributor of news, its refusal to act as a true gatekeeper allows lies to spread faster than truth. For that, I’m among Facebook’s worst critics. Yet Rappler’s exponential growth would not have happened without the social media giant.

I know its immense potential for good. That is why we continue to work with Facebook, as one of 3 fact-checking partners in our country, defining facts and looking at networks that spread lies.

I don’t think we have a choice. This is transformative technology, and we can use it to push Facebook to understand its true impact – good and evil – in the world. I’m cautiously optimistic that the good can prevail. On January 11, in its second takedown of “inauthentic” sites and accounts in the Philippines, Facebook banned a significant chunk of the disinformation ecosystem manipulating Filipinos with a link to the Internet Research Agency and the Russian disinformation ecosystem.

Rappler had identified the network, and written about it, nearly 13 months earlier.",0
24,Maria A. Ressa,"Great teachers who shape our values, our sense of right and wrong, will always be with us
Note: To celebrate National Teacher’s Month and Filipino-American History Month, I’d like to share this weekend in July with you. This first appeared in Rappler’s Brave New World newsletter, August 9, 2019. 

It was a weekend that stirred my soul and reminded me of the details that create our lives: jokes with lifelong friends; an orchestra room where I spent hours practicing – and the stage where we performed; the ties that created the person I have become.
 
My family left the Philippines in 1973 and settled in Toms River, New Jersey. My parents commuted nearly 4 hours a day to New York City so that their kids could avoid the inner city schools. Toms River’s public school system gave me free music lessons, computer programming classes, advanced placement classes that allowed us to compete in Ivy league schools, a future that promised you can accomplish anything if you work hard enough.

Everyone has a teacher who helped make them who they are. Mine is Donald Spaulding. I cried when I saw the announcement of his death on April 8, 2019 and contacted his family. His kids are now all grown up with kids of their own, and on July 28, the many people whose lives he touched came together back on the stage where we grew up for his memorial concert. When we arrived in Toms River, I was the short, quiet kid who could barely speak English. Mr. Spaulding nurtured me and others like me: kids looking to belong, looking for our place in the world. I first found that in music, and that became the foundation of student government, basketball, softball, theater, so much more – extra-curricular activities and academics that shaped my world. When I graduated high school, I was voted “Most Likely to Succeed.”

I couldn’t have done all that without Mr. Spaulding. He was not just my violin teacher and orchestra conductor. He helped me learn to play up to 8 different instruments (some not very good). All these experiments in my life – that is because of Don Spaulding, who would pick me up from the other side of town so that I could have a chance to participate in rehearsals and gigs.

Without him, life would have been so different.

But that was only the beginning. He pushed me to be better than I could ever be – as a person and as a musician.

He helped me choose the music for all the auditions he pushed me to do – from the intermediate and high school orchestras in Toms River to the Garden State Youth Orchestra to All State to the Garden State Philharmonic to so many more. Mr. Spaulding heard every soaring note and every mistake, and always pushed me to do better. If you have never auditioned for first violin or concert mistress, you do not know what stress is! All my after school jobs then were music related: as a music counsellor at Camp Discovery to our T.R. Express: a country-western group of orchestra nerds playing the music we heard on the radio.

During Sunday brunches, we were a string quartet, but at night, we just had the best fun ever – earning more than I would have earned at McDonald’s or Dunkin Donuts. We got together because I wanted him to sing “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” – and when we finished figuring that out, we just kept playing – Kansas’ “Dust in the Wind,” Dan Fogelberg’s “Longer,” so many more. I will never forget playing at the Ground Round with the peanuts on the floor, at our local mall, at Six Flags’ Great Adventure … so many more.

We were a fixture at pop concerts – what fun we had! So at the memorial for Mr. Spaulding – after more than 3 decades, I picked up my violin and played in an orchestra again.

Our conductor, Sue Viksne Degoey, chose the lineup from what many of us played under Mr. Spaulding’s baton. I stepped into my high school self with Pachelbel’s Canon, and Keith Kalemba composed an original elegy.

We rehearsed for a little over an hour, and there we were, coming together, playing for the memory of a man we all loved. That weekend reminded me again that no one can accomplish anything meaningful alone.

A day before our concert some of my closest friends decided to meet at sunset at Island Beach State Park, bring food and drinks, and catch up over a bonfire.
 
It was a perfect day: a cool breeze blowing, just enough for us to sit in front of the fire and reminisce. Gigi and I lived around the block from each other and biked around the woods behind our houses. It was fun to deliberately get lost and then find our way home. Then we would save our money, and when we had enough, bike an hour to get a coke and French fries. Over the years, she carried so many science projects for me: an exploding volcano (which almost exploded at the bus stop), a solar oven .. and as she reminded me, my violin, guitar or whatever other instrument I was playing that day. I suppose we also gravitated together because we were brown in a predominantly white neighborhood. But it was something we were never conscious of because then the Philippines was a far, dim memory.

The past, present and the future came together, and I realized the person you are was already formed in high school. We fell into our old roles: Lisa, always the organizer who always thinks of everything; Cary, our Greek-American pragmatist; Larry, the boy-scout who built the bonfire; Ruthie, our marinerette; Yvonne, our basketball center … and my kid sister and cousin, who joked they were now part of the big kids’ table. So what did I learn? 

That an orchestra is a perfect metaphor for a working democracy: the music gives you systems and notes, but how you play, how you feel, how you lead, how you follow – well, that’s all up to you. It reminded me how much I loved being in the swirl of music, one part listening and soaring, another part counting the beats, watching the ups and downs of our bows, always part of you focused on the conductor, ready to follow. Excess within control. 

That great friendships, despite the distance of time and place, get better with age.

And that teachers, the mentors who point you in the right direction, will always be with you. Mr. Spaulding brought me back across the oceans, to relive, to play, to cry. Thank you, Mr. Spaulding, for your generosity of spirit, for helping me fit in, and for reminding me that music flows through our lives and connects all of us.",0
25,Maria A. Ressa,"‘This is an existential moment in time, where, if we don’t take the right steps forward, democracy as we know it is dead’

This is Maria Ressa’s keynote speech delivered to a standing ovation from nearly 2,000 journalists at the 11th Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Hamburg, Germany, on September 28, 2019. 

An attack on one is an attack on all.

The first time I heard that was more than two decades ago, looking at the virulent ideology that powered al-Qaeda. That was what the terrorists used to justify their attacks. Then at a pivotal moment, when I was still just learning to deal with the new weapon against journalists, Julie Posetti, who’s in the audience now, convinced me that I should be speaking about these attacks on social media – and within 24 hours convinced me to do an interview for a book she was working on for Unesco. Its title: An attack on one is an attack on all.

This is an existential moment in time – where, if we don’t take the right steps forward, democracy as we know it is dead.

The more I study this time – which started with technology’s disruption, then attacks against journalists, then democracy – the more I’m convinced that the attacks against us and our values are so insidious that the equivalent of an atomic explosion has ruptured our worlds – and all we do is chip away at the tip of the iceberg we can see. But please keep this in mind as I speak: an attack of massive casualties has occurred – and most of us don’t know about it.

I’ll talk about 3 points tonight: the battle for truth, the role of American social media platforms, and what we can do about it.

When journalists are under attack, democracy is under attack. Social media platforms are now the world’s largest distributor of news, but, while they’ve taken the revenues, they’ve ignored the gatekeeping powers that news groups have traditionally had.

It takes courage to fight back against the insidious manipulation these platforms have enabled. They’re now used as a weapon against journalists – where lies laced with anger and hate spread faster than facts. (Facts are kinda boring.)

This really hit me last December when Time Magazine named me one of the guardians of truth. At that point in time, I realized – among the Capital Gazette (the journalists who were killed there), the Reuters journalists still in prison in Myanmar at the time and Jamal Khashoggi – I was the only one who was both alive and free, making me think that never before has our profession…protecting our democracies…demanded so much from us.

The battle for truth is the battle of our generation. With technology as the accelerant, a lie told a million times becomes a fact.

Without facts, we don’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust. Without all 3, you can’t have democracy. This is why democracy is broken around the world.

In our country, the bottom up exponential attacks on social media astroturfing and creating a bandwagon effect soften the ground before the same lies came top down from our top government officials.

I know this first-hand: in 14 months, the Philippine government filed at least 11 cases and investigations against me and Rappler. I was arrested twice in a 5-week period, and I’ve posted bail 8 times in about 3 months. I have committed no crime except to be a journalist and to hold power to account.

I’ve seen social media and our legal system weaponized against those who ask questions, who stand up for values, who demand the rights guaranteed under our Constitution, which is patterned after the US Constitution.

When I was first arrested early this year, the officer said, “Ma’am, trabaho lang po.” (Ma’am, I’m only doing my job). Then he lowered his voice to almost a whisper as he read me my Miranda rights. He was clearly uncomfortable, and I almost felt sorry for him. Except he was arresting me – the last act in a chain of events meant to intimidate and harass me because I’m a journalist.

This officer was a tool of power – and an example of how a good man can turn evil – and how great atrocities happen. Hannah Arendt wrote about the banality of evil when describing men who carried out the orders of Hitler in Nazi Germany, how career-oriented bureaucrats can act without conscience because they justify that they’re only following orders.

This is how a nation loses its soul. So you have to know what values you are fighting for, and you have to draw the lines now: where this side you’re good, and this side you’re evil. Help us #HoldTheLine.

So what about American social media platforms? As many of you know now, I’m both a partner and a critic of Facebook. Rappler is one of two Filipino fact-checking partners in the Philippines. Facebook is essentially the internet in the Philippines.

We are the canary in the coal mine because globally Filipinos spend the most time online (more than 10 hours a day) and on social media (the 4th year in a row we’re the top users around the world). But we are also democracy’s dystopian future.

Early this month, I was with Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie (you know he’s just turning 30 years old), and he told me that the Philippines “creates an ideal petri dish where you can experiment on tactics and techniques that you wouldn’t be able to as easily in the West…and if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter, you won’t get caught. And if it does work, then you can then figure out how to port that to the West.”

I asked him if the Philippines paved the way for Brexit and Donald Trump. You know what he said? He sidestepped a little, but I’ll read his entire quote so stay with me:

Filipino politics kinda looks a lot like the United States. You’ve got a president who was Trump before Trump was Trump, and you have relationships with people close to him with SCL and Cambridge Analytica. And you had a lot of data being collected – the 2nd largest amount of data after the United States collected in the Philippines.

This kid behind the psychological operations web of Steve Bannon backed by Robert and Rebekah Mercer added that “colonialism never died, it just moved online.”

So…this nightmare began for me more than 3 years ago. Rappler wrote the first pieces about it globally in 2016. I wrote 2 of the 3 parts of our first series and was rewarded with an average of 90 hate messages per hour.

If nothing changes, what’s happened to us is going to happen to you. It’s already happening now. Underlying it all is greed and fear, in our case the violence a brutal drug war that the UN says has killed at least 27,000 people, far more than the official number of 5,500.

People are afraid to stand up for what is right because there are costs: Rappler in the Philippines is a cautionary tale – and one of my arresting officers said it best when he was trying to silence our young reporter who was livestreaming. He said: “Be quiet, or you’re next.”

This micro-targeting online ad-driven business model structurally undermines human will. Our personal experiences are sucked into a database, organized by AI, then sold to the highest bidder. It is – as it has always been – about power and money. That has also siphoned money away from news groups, and if nothing is done, this represents a foundational threat to markets, election integrity, and democracy itself.

These social media platforms are behavioral modification systems we voluntarily enter. We are Pavlov’s dogs – and let me quote Wylie again as well as Blackberry co-founder Jim Balsillie: they said that data at this micropersonal level is NOT the new oil. It is plutonium. And we need to treat it like plutonium – with all the care that requires. Remember, I said, an atom bomb has exploded – and we all don’t know about it. Until we accept that, we can’t solve the problem.

So what can we do?

First, journalists need to collaborate. Throw out your old definitions. This is a new world. Collaborating isn’t easy because we were born to compete against each other. In the Philippines, our data tells us that news groups have been pushed to the periphery of our information ecosystem, and in the center are disinformation networks – some linked to Russian disinformation networks, some to China. They are all actively sharing each other – while we are not. This is how alternative realities bloom.

We have to stop taking the bait of emotions. Seek what we have in common over what drives us apart because that’s the way the bad guys are working: they take a fracture line in our societies and pound it open to separate us into us vs them.

And it’s not just the journalists…let’s bring in academia, tech, civil society – the truth-tellers. We have to join forces to protect the facts.

We have to fight now, while we’re strong – because, as we have learned, you only get weaker over time because this virus of lies saps civic engagement. If you have no facts, civil society becomes apathetic, and the voice with the loudest megaphone wins.

Second, we need to demand enlightened self-interest from tech companies because, in the long term, yes, the solution is education; medium term: media literacy. But in the here and now? It’s only the tech platforms that can do something meaningful.

Third, we need to create a global database of disinformation networks, and a global interpol that stops the impunity that nations and companies are getting away with today. Remember after the Holocaust and WWII, the world came together to try to stop the worst of human behaviors. That was when we got Bretton Woods, NATO, the UN Declaration of Human Rights. What are the values that govern the internet? How do we punish offenders?

We need to seriously come together and fight because an attack on one is an attack on all.

Power – and bullies – will never stop if you give in to them. We at Rappler live this every day.

Early this month, our presidential spokesman and chief legal counsel to President Duterte threatened to file cases against two news groups, including Rappler, because we called out a glaring conflict of interest. He split hairs and attempted to redefine his actions based on a technicality. One news group apologized. We did not.

Here’s the twist: the apology wasn’t enough for our Palace spokesman. His words ultimately justified Rappler’s decision to #HoldTheLine.

Political bullies who threaten and abuse journalists are never happy until they get complete capitulation.

Our battle is your battle.

Protect the rights guaranteed by our democracies or watch them slowly erode in plain sight. This is the challenge for all of us today – for next year’s Global Investigative Journalism Conference. What can we put in place today to protect our tomorrows?

I want to thank all the news organizations here who helped us shine the light. Please, let us do the same for every journalist under attack in every part of the world.

Remember: an attack on one is an attack on all. ",0
26,Maria A. Ressa,"Even as we see what's being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now,' says Rappler CEO Maria Ressa in a speech at the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health Commencement Ceremonies
Rappler CEO Maria Ressa addressed the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health’s Class of 2019 on Sunday, August 11, urging them to build their identity, profession, and the nation’s democracy by embracing their values, their fears, and their journey. 

A total of 148 graduates received their dual MD/Master of Business Administration degrees. 

“You will help define what our society will look like and how our democracy will survive and evolve,” she told the graduates at the Meralco Theater. “This is a time of creative destruction. Even as we see what’s being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now,” she said.

Below is the full text of her speech.

Congratulations, Class of 2019!

You’re graduating at an existential moment in history. 

When global power structures are turned upside down by technology, triggering an erosion of all our rights.

When journalists around the world are under attack, democracy is under attack. 

I know this firsthand: in 14 months, the Philippine government filed at least 11 cases and investigations. I was arrested twice in a 5-week period early this year, and I’ve posted bail 8 times in about 3 months. In order to travel, I have to post more than P500,000 in bonds. 

Journalism is not a crime. 

Yet, I’ve seen social media and our legal system weaponized against us – and any other perceived critics of government. 

We hold the line. Because we live our mission. Because – as Time Magazine wrote – we are the Guardians of Truth.

This battle for truth is the battle of our generation.  

Now more than ever, we know that information is power. Without the right information, it’s impossible to fight back – whether it’s to find a cure for a disease or to hold power to account.

We need to fight the insidious manipulation social media technology platforms have allowed: where lies laced with anger and hate spread faster than facts.  

These lies are like a virus that has infected our information ecosystem, playing to the worst of human nature, turning us against each other. They replicate and cripple our body politique – spreading a disease that still has no cure.  

A lie told a million times becomes a fact. Without facts, we don’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust.  

This is why democracy is broken, not just in the Philippines but around the world. 

I’d like to share 3 lessons with you as you go into battle for your identity, your profession, our democracy. 

Embrace your values because with that comes your humanity.
Embrace your fears.
Embrace your journey.  
Embrace your values 

Remember why you chose to become a doctor. 

You chose a specialized degree that has an embedded mission for a broken society. Seven out of 10 Filipinos die without ever seeing a doctor, and the statistics promise you no sleep — like: only 3 public doctors for every 100,000 people.

To those who chose business, how are you going to fight corruption? 

Life is all about making choices. That’s what we do every minute of the day. 

These little choices define who you are, and if you’re not clear about your values, you may wake up when you’re older and realize you don’t like the person you’ve become. 

Every choice defines who you are, and they could be really simple like choosing to turn right instead of left – they lead to different paths. Or accepting a bribe because in your mind you’ve rationalized it as a gift.  

Character is created in the sum of all these little choices we make.  

Now, while you’re sitting there before going into battle, choose the values that define you. Do it now. Because when you’re tested – and it will come if it hasn’t already – you have to know the lines you’ve set. 

Draw the line: on this side you’re good; on this side you’re evil.  

This is what prevents situational ethics. This makes sure you can’t rationalize bad behavior. 

You don’t really know who you are until you’re forced to defend it. Then every battle you win, or lose, every compromise you choose to make…or to walk away from – all these struggles define the values you live by and, ultimately, who you are. 

Then when you’re in battle, avoid the hate: the US against THEM, rich vs poor, dilawan vs DDS – these labels are meant to divide us. Populism is easy. Real leadership is not.  

Find what we all have in common. That’s our humanity. 

Alone we accomplish very little – no matter how bright or talented you are. It’s about what we can do together, to find what binds us together. 

We build a stronger democracy by strengthening our common humanity.  Embrace your fears 

I’ve been asked a lot in the past year: are you afraid? Of course, I’ve had those moments! But CNN trained me to be a conflict reporter, a war zone correspondent. I plan the way in and chart the way out of any field of battle. 

What I’ve learned is that fear spreads and is debilitating. Fear is a luxury.  

If you’re in the middle of chaos, you need to stamp down your fear to have clarity of thought – that’s essential to make the right decision. The way to do that is the 7Ps: “Proper preparation prevents poor performance.”

So I go back to what I learned in school. Fear is your worst enemy. It stops you from doing what you want.  

Whatever you’re most afraid of, touch it. Hold it. Embrace it. Because once you do that, nothing can stop you.  

In my case, dealing with the fear really started last December. That was when Time Magazine named me person of the year – one of the guardians of truth – and I realized I was the only one among us who was then both alive and free. That was the seed. 

Then last April at the launch of the Clooney Foundation’s Trial Watch, for some reason, it became real. I realized I could go to jail – 63 years, in fact, as Amal Clooney pointed out. I was on a panel: Mohamed Fahmy, who was jailed in Egypt for 438 days, was to my right. Jason Rezaian, who was jailed in Iran for 544 days.  

I talked to them. I read their books. Could I endure what they went through? 

What is the worst case scenario I could imagine.  

Then I embraced it. And robbed it of its power.

Prepare for the worst, and hope for the best. 

Embrace your journey

The founders of Rappler – 4 of us, women in our 50s now – well, we joke that we jumped off the cliff. In the Philippines, we’re the only news group whose business is created and controlled by journalists. That’s what we mean by independence. 

So it’s not a surprise that we would continue doing the story, even if – and especially if – it’s bad for business. Yet, despite that, we found a new business model that has our revenues up significantly since last year. We’ll take the risk to do the stories that matter.

The first casualty in our country’s war for truth is exactly how many people have died in our brutal drug war. The police admit they killed more than 6,000 people – rolled back by PDEA right before SONA to 5,600. But human rights groups and the UN estimate that at least 27,000 people were killed from July 2016 until December last year.  

Our impunity series looks at the lives behind these numbers. We fight impunity on two fronts: the Philippine government in extrajudicial killings and the exponential lies on social media – Facebook, which is essentially our internet. 

Facebook is the world’s largest distributor of news, but it ignored the responsibility that comes with that – the gatekeeping powers of journalism, that determines the quality of our democracies around the world. 

I don’t know where any of this will end. Like I said, we jumped off the cliff by standing up for our values, by upholding the mission of journalism, and holding the powerful to account. 

Facebook is our frenemy: Rappler is one of its 3 fact-checking partners in the Philippines, but finding the lies is a game of whack-a-mole. What’s more important is to find the networks of disinformation that spread the lies – and in that you see how all this is connected to geopolitical power play. In our digital forensics, we’ve shown links to the alt-right in Canada, to the alt-right in the US, to Europe, and to Russian disinformation. 

Embrace your journey. And don’t forget to have fun. 

I am daily inspired by our team in Rappler, their spirit, their sense of mission. Despite the threats we face, we are living our ideals now. This is our reality.

What you do today matters.  

You will help define what our society will look like and how our democracy will survive and evolve.  

This is a time of creative destruction. Even as we see what’s being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now.  

Let’s make sure it’s the future we want.  

Get ready for battle. Embrace your values and your humanity. Embrace your fears and embrace the journey. Class of 2019, our hopes are with you. It’s going to be tough but I know you will change the world for the better.",0
27,Maria A. Ressa,"It’s time to ask yourself a question we’ve lived with for years now: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth?
Silence is complicity. 

The blatant abuses of power are now codified into law. It happened in June: a regional trial court’s order changing the period of prescription for libel from 1 year to 12 years; the shutdown of ABS-CBN; and the quick passage of the Anti-Terror Law, under which a critical voice can be named a terrorist, arrested without a warrant, and jailed for up to 24 days. 

The walls are closing in. 

The Philippines is at the precipice. There’s no need to declare martial law because the very processes of democracy have been turned against it. We now live in a time that is “worse than martial law.”

It’s democracy’s death by a thousand cuts. 

The way we at Rappler have survived 4 years of attacks is by: 

1. Shining the light: Name it and demand signatures to these abuses. If we can’t get justice now, we will later. History is on our side. 

2. More hard-hitting journalism: Continue to hold the powerful to account and demand accountability for the people. Of course, the more we do that, the more the full power of the State is turned against us.

3. More innovation: We continue to explore and to build at a time of creative destruction. The Lighthouse, rolling out this week, is our latest experiment and  provides a beacon to safer shores. (Read: How Lighthouse gave us hope)

Hatred, arrogance, and incompetence can only affect you if you let it. The battle begins in our minds. (Read: Rappler ends 2019 with income: A comeback year) 

While I hate being the government’s cautionary tale, I’m not afraid. It made me stronger, solidified the values I believe in, made me draw the line I cannot cross. I will defend the mission of journalism as long as we are a democracy because press freedom is the foundation of every right of every Filipino under our Constitution. My job is to hold up the sky so our journalists can do their work. 

It’s time to ask yourself a question we’ve lived with for years now: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth? I am at peace with my answer.

Everyone who speaks comes under attack on social media, once an enabler, now a tool for oppression. Be prepared for it. Accept this will happen. Social media is now a behavioral modification system. 

We’re demanding accountability as well from the social media platforms, but Lighthouse is also an experiment to see how tech can serve journalism and democracy. Please test it and give us your feedback. 

We can’t do this alone. The impunity of power is brazen, and the battle has now come to every Filipino. (Read: ABS-CBN’s battle is also ours)

We’re not alone. What’s happening in the Philippines is happening globally. In 2018, I laid out 6 action points for the international community. 

Many of you know I spent nearly two decades working outside the Philippines (and recently had a chance to celebrate #CNN40 with my former colleagues). After the June 15 conviction on cyber libel, 60 press freedom organizations around the world came together to help independent media survive in our country. Please consider signing this petition to help me stay out of jail. #JournalismIsNotACrime

When facts are under attack, journalism is activism. Help us #HoldTheLine for our rights. 

Use it or lose it.

28,Maria A. Ressa,"Technology and the pandemic have destroyed our old world and are forcing all of us to actively create a new one. We need to act now.'
Right before America votes, I can’t help but think we are underestimating the impact of technology on our behavior. Behavioral research has long shown that we vote, not based on what we think, but on how we feel. Now imagine that in today’s information ecosystem, which uses neuroscience and predictive analytics to shape our behavior. It’s an extractive business model that allows “fake news” to flourish.

Technology upended journalism, pitting evidence-based news organizations against propaganda, hate speech, and conspiracy theories. Mocha and QAnon won; news lost. That’s what the data shows. 

For about a decade now, technology has been a tsunami, devastating and reshaping industries: music (Apple, Spotify), hotels (Airbnb), transportation (Uber, Grab), and so many more. News organizations lost their gatekeeping roles to technology. That upended the information ecosystem and the distribution of facts. It began to reshape systems of governance and change the geopolitical power balance. 

The new gatekeepers had easy confidence because they cut the world into quantifiable pieces – never mind if it isn’t true, and never mind the consequences.

Move fast, break things
Decades back, I remember asking questions the engineers couldn’t answer about the impact of their choices on society: on personalization; the lies that you can only mute or block; the unintended consequences of “friends of friends” growth.

Personalized recommendations moved from whatever you searched for (that followed you for weeks online) to personalized news feeds. The question I asked then: how can we all have our own different realities? How can news exist in a world like that? If there is no shared public reality, no shared facts, then democracy as we know it is dead.

Lies that you can only mute or block drive me crazy as a journalist. Because they stay and continue to spread: the more salacious, the faster the spread. Emotions, like anger and hate, spread faster too. That alone showed the abdication of responsibility of the new gatekeepers and how little respect they had for the public.
This played right into long-running Russian military tactics which the public saw in Crimea in 2014. Called the firehose of falsehood, Russian propaganda is meant to “entertain, confuse, and overwhelm.” Fast forward a few years, and now you have leaders of democracies, elected with the help of social media, mimicking the same tactics, like President Rodrigo Duterte or President Donald Trump.

How every social media platform uses algorithms recommending friends of friends to grow your network and their user base. Except that one seemingly minor decision, while good for growth, also built filter bubbles and divisiveness – us against them thinking – into the platforms distributing the news and consequently, into our societies.
These 3 practices and many more are part of a god’s eye-view of data, where content is neither good nor evil, and the goal of accumulating data above all feeds the business model of predictive behavioral analysis, the cornerstone of what Shoshana Zuboff calls “surveillance capitalism.”

One root cause
In her groundbreaking book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, this Harvard emeritus professor argues that many of the problems we’re dealing with today – the weaponization of social media, the destruction of data privacy and security, our inability to hold technology platforms to account – are all part of the same problem: the extractive business model which is insidiously manipulating us without our knowledge. 

Working with Shoshana in The Real Facebook Oversight Board, I’ve put words to my experiences, like “radical indifference” – what she calls “an asocial framework” for evaluating data because in this world, all data is equal. The key is volume, not quality. This is the core of “fake news” – strip branding from news organizations, which differentiate between fact and fiction. In this world, lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and further than boring facts. (READ: The Spread of True and False News Online)

So what do we do about this? Our solution in Rappler is 3-fold, aligned with our founding principles: 1. Demand accountability from technology; 2. Protect and grow investigative journalism; and 3. Build community and civil society. (READ: As democracy dies, we build a global future) 

Build better
This month, the Information and Democracy Forum will be releasing 4 papers from our infodemics working group that former EU Parliament member Marietje Schaake and I co-chair. We recommend policy frameworks around 4 structural challenges: the transparency of digital platforms; the meta-regulation of content moderation; the platform design and reliability of content; and mixed private and public spaces on closed messaging services. 

We see this as a jump-off point for governments, technology companies, and civil society organizations to begin a much needed public discussion with academics, lawyers, and journalists. 

Technology and the pandemic have destroyed our old world and are forcing all of us to actively create a new one. Defining the problem, bringing in all who need to help solve it – these are only the first steps to make sure we create the world we want.

29,Maria A. Ressa,"Here are 3 battle fronts for a global response – lessons from the Rappler trenches (and how we’re helping build the future now)'
Silicon Valley’s sins have come home to roost. What happened in countries like the Philippines is now threatening US elections. That’s why about a month before the November 3 vote, I joined Carole Cadwalladr, the British journalist who broke the Cambridge Analytica story, and 22 other industry experts in The Real Facebook Oversight Board – “an emergency intervention aimed at Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook employees.”

Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, kicked off our launch on October 1, 2020. “Our group has come together for one purpose: we demand comprehensive action to ensure that Facebook cannot be weaponized to undermine the vote and with it American democracy,” she said. 

We fear it may be too late. Learn our lessons from the Philippines. It’s strange when you begin to see a dystopian future and count the forks in the roads not taken. And you begin to understand how Cassandra and Sisyphus felt. 

PH: First domino to fall
Democracy is dying. That was what I told Facebook in August 2016; what I repeated 4 months later to journalists at the Google NewsLab in Mountain View; and what I said in every keynote around the world, in every award acceptance speech in the past 4 years. 

Lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and farther than boring facts on social media. A lie told a million times becomes a fact. Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust. Without all 3, democracy as we know it is dead.  The Philippines was the first domino to fall in 2016, followed a month later by Brexit. As Rappler’s business and technology leader, an investigative journalist, and the target of government attacks, I lived through the different strands that led us here. 

After all, Rappler started on Facebook in 2011. We saw its best and are now living through its worst. Frenemies, I call us. Rappler was among the first to see the problem and worked quietly behind the scenes, but we had a responsibility to tell our public how they are being manipulated. In 2016, we did stories about the impunity of two men: Rodrigo Duterte and Mark Zuckerberg. 

Now I am horrified to watch what is happening as Americans prepare to vote, worried about the campaigning already happening on Facebook for our 2022 presidential elections. 

Without facts, how can any nation have integrity of elections? Does free will even exist with constant, insidious manipulation? 

Learn from our experience in the last 4 years. This is how power shapes reality and destroys trust. With the help of Silicon Valley. 

Machine manipulates us
In 2016, Rappler documented and tracked the data and influence operations: the attacks began after we exposed the pro-Duterte propaganda machine seeding attack narratives like “journalist equals criminal.” 

In 2017, that same message bottom up came top down when President Duterte attacked Rappler in his State of the Nation address. A little more than a week later, we received our 1st subpoena.

In 2018, the law was weaponized: 11 complaints and cases were filed against me and Rappler. 

In 2019, I was arrested twice in a 5-week period and forced to post bail 8 times in about 3 months to stay free and keep doing my job. 

In 2020, I was convicted of cyber libel for a story we published 8 years ago, one I didn’t write, edit, or supervise at a time when the law we supposedly violated didn’t even exist. Yet, a former colleague, Rey Santos, Jr, and I can go to jail for up to 6 years. 

Social media is now a behavior modification system, and we are Pavlov’s dogs. 

We input our atomized selves, and for each post, machine learning builds a model of who we are: it knows us better than our family and friends, better than we know ourselves. Then artificial intelligence takes our most vulnerable moment to a message and sells it to the highest bidder. It could be a company or a country. This pattern of insidious manipulation creates its own feedback loop that keeps the machine learning and growing. 

Cheap state-sponsored armies on social media are in at least 70 countries around the world in 2019, according to the Oxford University Computational Research Project. It is a scorched-earth policy for power and money, now part of the global dictator’s playbook.  We fought back and survived the last 4 years by understanding the data and by realizing how social media abdicated responsibility to protect the public sphere. We built our response on the 3 pillars of Rappler: technology, investigative journalism, community. 

Here are 3 battle fronts for a global response – lessons from the Rappler trenches (and how we’re helping build the future now): 

TECHNOLOGY: The world’s largest distributor of news today is Facebook. Yet, it is biased against facts, biased against journalism at a time when journalists are under attack on at least 2 fronts: our credibility and business model. This is the first priority because we have to stop the virus of lies from coming into our information ecosystem.

Here in the Philippines, we’re helping build technology that will protect users and allow a thinking slow process critical to democracy. This is Lighthouse.

Globally, we need policy solutions. This is why former EU Parliament Member Marietje Schaake and I are co-chairing the steering committee of experts from academe, human rights, technology, and law for structural solutions to deal with this “infodemic.” The initiative has received strong support from nearly 50 foreign ministers from the Alliance of Multilateralism, and is expected to release potential structural solutions in November.

JOURNALISM: Facts must survive, and experiments for the distribution of news must continue, even while the cleanup of social media platforms begin. Independent news organizations must survive this crisis of confidence and trust as well as the continuing assault on its advertising business model.

In the Philippines, Rappler is taking the processes we use for our investigative journalism into disinformation networks, and building them into a product. This is part of the reason that despite the attacks, Rappler not only survived, we thrived. Every company is vulnerable to manipulation and attacks in the age of social media, and aside from dashboards, companies need to pivot and learn to combine structured and unstructured data with the latest technology to protect itself and to build community.

When the law is used to attack journalists, the defense is not just local, it’s global, because it links directly to issues of rule of law and international law. Aside from our Filipino lawyers led by Francis Lim at ACCRA and Ted Te at FLAG, Rappler receives pro bono legal support from Covington & Burling, LLC. Our international team is led by human rights lawyers Amal Clooney and Caoilfhionn Gallagher, QC.

Globally, only 0.3% of development funds go to media, and independent news groups will need help to survive the next few years of our information dystopia. This is why there is an effort to get an International Fund for Public Interest Media established: $1 billion annually raised and distributed globally in a transparent manner. Luminate and BBC Media Action’s James Deane are leading this charge; I am part of its Advisory Group.

COMMUNITY/CIVIC ENGAGEMENT: Rappler’s elevator pitch in 2012 is “we build communities of action.” This changes when it becomes dangerous to speak your mind or when communities can’t tell fact from fiction.

In the Philippines, Rappler continues to grow MovePH, our younger communities of action centered around climate change, fact-checking, gender equality, and health. Since 2018, our communities rallied around our values of speaking truth to power and demanding accountability, and our crowdfunding campaign has helped pay our exponential legal fees.

Globally, journalists and press freedom groups around the world have come together to help Rappler shine the light on abuses of power in the Philippines. Nearly 80 civil society organizations are in the #HoldTheLine Coalition, led by 3 amazing women: Courtney Radsch from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ); Julie Posetti from the International Center for Jounalists (ICFJ); and Rebecca Vincent from Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Let me end the way I began with our most effective civic engagement at this moment in time: the Real Facebook Oversight Board – when journalists, academe, civil rights activists, and government officials past and present made clear demands for immediate reforms to help ensure the integrity of facts and elections. Within our first 24 hours, Facebook acted. 

The worst public health crisis in a century and the death of facts enabled the consolidation of power by populist authoritarian leaders. 

It’s clear now that what happens in the Philippines does not stay in the Philippines.

It’s a brave, new world: like the virus, like climate, the battle for truth – for democracy – is global. 

It’s time we start building the future we want, eyes wide open.",0
30,Maria A. Ressa,"Why Lighthouse? Because journalists shine the light, and a lighthouse is a beacon showing travelers the way to safe harbor.'


Embrace your fear: a lesson I learned when I was young, now even more relevant as we enter week 8 of a pandemic lockdown.

That’s what Rappler learned to do after nearly 4 years of government attacks – from the weaponization of social media in 2016 to the 11 politically motivated cases filed against us in 14 months.

For me that meant seriously thinking about jail. Last year, I was arrested twice and detained, forced to post bail 8 times to stay free. Taken cumulatively, Amal Clooney tells me the charges carry over 100 years in prison. As a consolation, Ted Te reminds me the most I need to serve is 40 years.

I am not a criminal. I am a journalist. 

Yet, this is what it takes to be a journalist in the Philippines today. Submit, accept a Damocles’ sword over your head, censor yourself, or be punished. Well, I never did like bullies, and I’ve learned that you define who you are when you’re tested. When we at Rappler look back a decade from now, we will know we did everything we could to protect our democracy.

So I touched my fear and learned to embrace it. Once you do that, you rob it of its power. We at Rappler imagined worst case scenarios, planned, and drilled for them.

Little did we know our planning would prepare our organization for this pandemic. (READ: #CourageON: All in…together!)

Courage comes from action

Left alone against brutal and immense power, we learned that the real battle is in our minds. You lose when you allow fear and panic to rule.

What kept us grounded was our deliberate effort to strengthen our mission of hard-hitting investigative journalism, not just to be reactive or defensive. After you embrace your fear, what’s next?

You build for the future. You imagine the world as it should be, and you create.

Enter Lighthouse, technology in the hands of journalists, trained to protect the public sphere where democracy thrives. (READ: Introducing Lighthouse: Rappler’s new platform)  

The process of imagining the future fueled our hope. We had tried agile development in 2015 but failed. This time with a mindset to learn, we turned to experts, and slowly, this new way of thinking and solving problems began to seep into our organization. We began to work more collaboratively, combining the top-down journalists’ workflow with the atomized bottom-up tech workflow. 

When I was arrested in March last year, I was thinking of new ways to use natural language processing or how we turn words into data – and many more problems that kept my imagination active. It was only peripherally that I realized there were 7 police in the van driving me from the airport to the precinct, and 4 of them were in full swat combat gear. (Really? I thought.) It was a great way to learn anger management.

Why Lighthouse? Because journalists shine the light, and a lighthouse is a beacon showing travelers the way to safe harbor. 

After the lockdown, it’s not a surprise that groups like the TOWNS Foundation, which raised P60 million and delivered its 100,000th PPE, personal protective equipment, to Cebu last week said they were inspired by action. Or Ken Abante and his 50+ volunteers who monitor weekly where the emergency budgets are going. Or MovePH,  its fact-checking initiatives, and Project Lifeline. 

Hope comes from courage. In a pandemic, where does hope come from? From the courage of our frontliners. From the courage of our people. 

As leaders gain more power around the world to deal with the crisis, we need to be vigilant that we don’t permanently give away our hard-earned freedoms. 

Despite the tragic global death toll, we know the worst is yet to come as workers and companies stave off bankruptcy and fight to survive.

It’s fitting that we introduce Lighthouse on World Press Freedom Day. When lies can kill, facts matter. Accountability is more important today than ever. Our lives depend on it so #CourageON!",0
31,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Clear from the genealogy of PhilHealth is its continuing mandate to provide comprehensive and equitable health care. Policy-wise, there should be no more question that aside from quality education, effective public health is a good “strategy for bringing about faster economic development and improving quality of life.” It’s a direct, and no doubt, quick route to higher labor productivity and economic growth.

PhilHealth descended from martial law’s Medicare as administered by the Philippine Medical Care Commission pursuant to the Philippine Medical Care Act of 1969. Total coverage of medical services according to the needs of patients is its ultimate goal.  It was to be an evolving extension of medical care to all residents based obviously on the nation’s financial capability by mandating contribution to help build the medical care fund. 

The basic idea was first to leverage on both the SSS and GSIS medical programs while preparing to cover non-members on a compulsory and automatic basis. Not bad for a developing country in the late 1960s.

A National Health Insurance Program was established in 1995, mandating the creation of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and replacing the Commission as administrator. This law proceeds from the 1987 constitutional mandate for “an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all people at affordable cost.”

For the same reason, the Universal Healthcare (UHC) Law of 2019 automatically enrolled in PhilHealth all Filipino citizens, including overseas Filipino workers. This means any Filipino can avail himself of health care benefits even without a PhilHealth ID card. There is no better way to institutionalize universal health care than through a contributory health insurance scheme.

Yes, the operative words are accessibility and affordability. 

All citizens shall have access to health services at first “with at least a basic minimum package of health insurance benefits.” The law prioritizes a person’s health needs than his ability to pay based on the principle of risk sharing among various income and age groups. There is also unequivocal mandate for PhilHealth to contain cost to help the people afford healthcare services.

Since not every one of the 113-million Filipinos contributes to the fund, and medical cost is rising like crazy, health premium is not just enough even if it was recently jacked up. With a broad coverage of inpatient care, among others, budget support is essential. Funding is short even with contributions from PCSO and PAGCOR and from the budget itself of the Department of Health. 

For 2024, PhilHealth received more than a hundred-billion-peso budget to accommodate an expanded pool of beneficiaries and to sustain current programs. Some 1.31 million indigent and financially incapable patients are to receive medical assistance. With parallel efforts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other government programs, some 12.75 million indigent members are expected to be reached this year. 

This is far from universal even as the intent is. 

If past WHO data were to be a guide, PhilHealth has a lot of homework to do. With sustained population growth, life expectancy in the Philippines surprisingly declined from 69 years in 2000 to 66.4 years in 2021. In Western Pacific, comparable data actually rose from 72.4 years to 77.4 years. In this age, tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death for children below five. Why, this is a scourge of highly impoverished nations.

And if this is not enough, based on statistics from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the healthcare continues to be a big burden for households. Their out-of-pocket payment had the biggest share of 44.5 percent among the health care funding schemes in 2023, higher than government and voluntary healthcare system.

Comparing the Philippines with other ASEAN neighbors in terms of critical health outcome shows some embarrassing results. Three years ago, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies in a study prepared by research fellow Valerie Gilbert T. Ulip and research analyst Lyle Daryll D. Casas ('Regional Health Integration and Cooperation in the Philippines') concluded that we fell behind our ASEAN counterparts. Normally, health systems must have sufficient health facilities offering different types and levels of health services. 

This is not the case for the Philippines.

For instance, hospital beds are limited, short of 400,000 beds. Half of the Filipinos have no timely access to primary healthcare facilities. We spend only about 1.5 percent of GDP to health, really no comparison with Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Our handicap in health human resources is just enormous. Ten percent of our rural units have only one doctor each while many health facilities do not even have a nurse or a midwife. Finally, our public health capacity for emergencies is extremely low. WHO’s international health regulations gave us a score of only 53 percent, only better than Lao PDR and Cambodia.

No AI is necessary to draw the extent of the challenge for the health sector in the Philippines. There is so much ground to flesh out the universality, accessibility and affordability of healthcare system. 

Adding the regular contributions of members to subsidies from the national government and remittances from both PCSO and PAGCOR yields big, big shortfall. Yet, PhilHealth failed to spend all its money in 2024 to the tune of ₱89.9 billion. 

With dwindling fiscal space and burgeoning public debt that has exceeded the threshold of 60 percent of GDP against the commitment of NG to refrain from introducing new taxes or imposing higher taxes, the only recourse of government is to increase the dividend rate and sweep all “unused funds” from government-owned and controlled corporations.

Finance Secretary Ralph Recto was recently quoted by ABS-CBN News saying that the full remittance and appropriate use of PhilHealth’s ₱89.9 billion could add 0.88 ppts to national output and add 600,000 more jobs. Interesting quote, but first, can the remittance be properly done and second, how does one convert it to output and jobs? (To be continued)",0
32,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"As we suggested in our last column, it is no secret that the Philippines’ official sports program is not perfect. 

The first known government sports organization was the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF) in 1911, which was formed only to resolve what was then the ongoing “menace of professionalism” and erosion in Philippine sports. Around 50 years later, in the 1960s, the Association for the Advancement of Amateur Athletic (AAAA) came into being. 

Under martial law, Presidential Decree No. 604 established the Department of Youth and Sports Development in 1974 and abolished the PAAF, transferring all its resources and functions to the Department. Later renamed Ministry of Youth and Sports Development in 1979, it was mandated under Letter of Instruction No. 955 to implement Project Gintong Alay (PGA).

PGA sought to put under one roof all development programs of athletics, first for track and field, and later for some other sports. Reported prodigies include the legendary Lydia de Vega, Isidro del Prado, Hector Begeo and Elma Muros. 

Aside from these initiatives, if there’s anything that speaks best of our desire to land in the podium, it is the 1987 Philippine Constitution’s declaration of the importance of sports in establishing a healthy and functioning citizenry. 

In 1990, with the significant evolution of global sports, then President Cory Aquino signed into law a new government sports agency with stronger and more focused objectives. The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was thus born to transform the Filipino people into “a healthy citizenry through various commendable sports development programs.”

The Commission’s vision is focused on one, increased participation in sports by Filipinos, and two, excellence in sports performance by Filipinos. Its mission is to coordinate and implement our national sports program, democratize sports access and training, and elevate the level of training for highly talented and promising athletes for global competition. 

Filipinos can bet that there has never been a dearth of sports projects and programs across the country. PSC lists in its website Batang Pinoy, Indigenous People’s Games, Laro’t Saya sa Parke, Philippine National Games, Pilipinas Para Games and Gender and Development Program. 

So, what ails Philippine sports, that our medal campaigns in global competitions have been sporadic and obviously incoherent?

Veteran sportswriter Joaquin Henson explained some years ago in the Philippine Star why the Philippines has yet to win an Olympic gold after nearly a hundred years of participating in the Olympics. For him, it was “an arduous journey of frustration, exasperation and disappointment.” At that time, the Philippines held the distinction of second in the world for reaping gold-less medals with 10, Malaysia being the first with 11. 

Henson cited the lack of coordination between the PSC and the private organization Philippine Olympic Committee (POC). Government is focused on grassroots development and yet controls the budget to finance national athletes. Meanwhile, the POC consists of the national sports associations that aim to develop star athletes but is undermined by reported politics, graft, nepotism, and incompetence. We are no match to Thailand, Henson argued, which had accumulated more than 30 medals in only 70 years of its Olympics participation. 

Henson also blamed the so-called shot-gun approach in allocating limited resources to several sports, a clear exercise in dissipation. Instead, we need our sports officials to concentrate on niche sports calibrated with weight classification like boxing, judo, weightlifting and similar sports. It would be considered suicidal if we continue to spend feeble resources on sports where our likelihood of success is slim because the sports is free for all.

Funding is another reason for our weak performance not just in the Olympics, but also in the Asian Games or SEA Games. While the law requires the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) to remit five percent of its gross revenues to the PSC, or at that time, ₱200 million monthly, what goes into the operation of the Commission is much less than the required remittance.

Perhaps it’s not asking for the moon if we can also professionalize both the PSC and the POC; less politics, more action. If we can do this, the budget for sports could be rationalized and properly allocated. If the plan is intentional and executed properly, with scorecards and accountability, we should be able to see good, institutionalized results. We can finally add more numbers to our sports greats, those talents that can harvest golds and silvers in global competitions — not as a matter of luck but as a matter of course.

In the last 10 years, it was reported that the PSC received an average of around ₱180 million annually from the public treasury. On top of this meager allocation, the PSC also gets money from PAGCOR and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes (PCSO) and a few other government institutions like the National Sports Development Fund. With additional funding from the Bureau of Customs, Philippine Racing Commission and private donations, that could easily amount to nearly ₱900 million a year. While this amount can seem staggering to the normal Filipino, it’s peanuts compared to what other countries are spending on sports and their athletes. Obviously, this disparity in investment explains our suboptimal performance in international games.

Despite it all, our athletes’ podium finishes prove that we are a country of hope, and that our resilience shines not just during flash floods, but also in the international arena. If we could produce a Hidilyn Diaz in weightlifting and a Carlos Yulo in gymnastics, we must be doing something right. But we could surpass ourselves if we succeed in producing more Diazes and Yulos on a more regular, more systematic basis. 

Yes, we’ll achieve more mileage if we channel some of those prizes to our reinvented sports program. Our athletes deserve a better life after the Olympics, something that could hopefully inspire rather than slacken them. But a better sports development program that produces excellence on a more regular basis should always be the first best.",0
33,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Tik Toks have institutionalized the Carlos Yulo landings in his floor routine for which he was awarded a perfect 15. We see people ending whatever they are doing with Yulo’s trademark open arms, or a series of tumbling into their shoes. With a 3.5 twist, Yulo ascended the Olympic podium with his gold medal, the first man to win an Olympic gold for the Philippines and second to weightlifting idol Hidilyn Diaz to harvest gold from the Olympics. He surpassed himself by winning a second gold in vault competition. Some commentators and sports writers were convinced his ability is otherworldly.   

It is otherworldly because his sports mastery started in his youth. At seven, his grandfather, impressed at his initial stunts at a local playground that is the Paraiso ng Batang Maynila, motivated him to focus on gymnastics. Since they stay along Leveriza Street which is close to Paraiso, he had all the time to do his stunts and tumbling routine. Paraiso truly was once upon a time a training ground for young athletes and sports enthusiasts. In the distant past, it was equipped with some playground equipment and sports facilities including monkey bars. 

Yulo could have been born several years later and missed out on these public facilities, now rare in many localities. They should cost almost nothing compared to the local governments’ own revenues and national tax allotment. Local governments never seem to realize they could produce Olympic champions by spending on some systematic sports development programs that could just spark our young Filipinos’ interest and inspire them to get into the loop. One does not need intelligence fund to highlight the importance of this public infrastructure in nurturing young bodies to global competitiveness. 

From Leveriza, Yulo moved on with his journey with destiny. He competed in various Palarong Pambansa almost annually and won gold, silver and bronze medals in various contests in gymnastics. As a junior, he won mostly gold in the ASEAN School Games and Pacific Rim Competitions. As a senior, Yulo harvested more medals at the Melbourne World Cup, Baku World Cup and Doha World Cup, among others. 

All told, Yulo has emerged as a young and living sports icon. He is a two-time Olympic champion, six-time world champion with two each for gold, silver and bronze; ten-time Asian Games champion; and nine-time SEA Games champion. 

With Yulo’s short stature, social media seems more enamored with “the precision of his form, and the difficulty of his routines especially in the floor exercises, vault and parallel bars.” Nothing beats congenital mastery. 

As the nation awaits Yulo’s return from Paris, enormous benefits await him, too.

The Philippine government is giving him ₱20 million cash while ₱6 million will come from the House of Representatives. The Philippine Olympic Committee is also gifting him with a house and lot. What was originally a two-bedroom condo unit in McKinley Hill, BGC worth ₱24 million, Megaworld was reported to have upgraded it to a three-bedroom unit worth ₱32 million, with ₱3 million cash bonus.

As if these were not enough, Yulo will also be getting from different donors such benefits as lifetime free eating privileges both buffet and ala carte, free gastro consultations and colonoscopy, free engineering designs and free furniture worth a hundred thousand pesos. The Guardian reported that he was also offered franchises for a coffee and lemon business plus a ₱10 million brand ambassadorship contract for a beauty clinic.

Dazzling, but these acts of appreciation may miss the point.

True, these donations to Yulo, and previously to Diaz, would hopefully inspire them to do many times better in the next Olympics, and many more young athletes to follow in their footsteps. But we need more than that. We need to institutionalize excellent performance in world sports competition. Sad to say, the previous budget allocated to sports development by past comparisons is not even a 10th of what other ASEAN countries spend on sports development. GMA news once described the country’s sports budget “like loose change against the income” of boxing legend Manny Pacquiao.

In fact, for 2025, the budget allocated to the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was reduced from ₱1.156 billion in 2024 to only ₱725 million. This budget covers general operations, amateur sports, training and preparation for the SEA Games in Thailand and the Asian Winter Games in China.

So, whatever happened to the Philippine Senate’s Resolution that commended the brilliant Yulo for winning the gold medal for the men’s floor exercises at the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Competition in Stuttgart, Germany. The Senate also recognized the potentials of Filipino athletes and in particular Yulo’s achievement as a “wake up call for our government to focus and provide more support to our athletes” competing in sports where size does not matter. 

We recall what happened nine years ago when the Philippine sports contingent to the SEA Games finished a poor sixth, the PSC cried “lack of budget.” At the Tokyo Olympics of 2020, Filipino athletes complained that the Philippine government failed them. Even Diaz herself complained of insufficient funds for her training that eventually led to the Philippines’ first Olympic gold.

As Muhammad Ali once quipped, champions are made from something they have deep inside them — a desire, a dream, a vision. For Ali, the will must be stronger than the skill. A sports development program would build the skills of our young athletes, it is hard work, strong discipline and perseverance that would build their will.

Sustaining his will is going to be a tall order for Yulo. Aside from the easy life that awaits him, and this could soften him a bit, he will have to face the reported issue with his own mother and his final decision on the next chapter of his love life. In sports like artistic gymnastics, any small distraction could cost the gold.  (To be concluded next week)",0
34,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"To be sure, and we heard them from NewsWatch Plus, there were many “sanas” during the 3rd SONA (State of the Nation Address) of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Sana bumaba ang presyo ng bilihin. Sana dumami ang trabaho. Sana ipagtanggol ang West Philippine Sea. Sana ipatigil na ang POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators). The civil society demands a good scorecard from this government.

With a fine-tooth comb, NEDA as the planning authority should do the monitoring having been mandated to prepare the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028. It’s an excellent Plan because it formalizes a comprehensive roadmap complete with actionable policies and programs and sets for Congress an appropriate set of legislative priorities to address both short-term and medium-term issues. A good scorecard and monitoring system should lead to a good execution of public policy. Otherwise, the vision for this nation could just ossify on paper. 

We focus on controlling inflation because it remains the most urgent concern of the Filipinos based on the latest Pulse Asia Survey for June 17-24 and Octa Survey for June 26-July 1. Around two-thirds of Pulse Asia and Octa respondents rated inflation control as the most urgent national concern. 

Inflation is closely related to the other concerns like increasing workers’ pay, because higher prices weaken their purchasing power. Reducing poverty is also critical because prices are already high. Creating more jobs is a direct means of empowering people to mitigate their poor condition and weaker spending capacity. Finally, fighting graft and corruption is considered one big impediment to appropriate public policy to provide infrastructure and social services. 

Table 1.1 of the PDP 2023-2028 provides us with the baseline of food and headline inflation at 5.7 percent and 5.6 percent for the period January-November 2022. For both indicators, the target was set at two to four percent for 2024 and 2025. 

We consider three components behind the inflation management in the Philippines. One is appropriate monetary policy; two, is a set of strong non-monetary measures to manage the supply side; and three, responsible fiscal policy. 

On monetary policy, we give high credit to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In the last six months of the previous administration, the BSP was so behind the curve before it decided to tighten monetary policy. This was rather too late and too little. For as early as March 2022 onwards, actual inflation had already reached the 4.0 percent upper end of the target, with inflation forecasts also subsequently breaching their targets for both 2022 and 2023.

When the Marcos government took over on July 1, 2022 the new BSP leadership jacked up the policy rate by 75 basis points (bps) from 2.5 percent to 3.25 percent in an off-cycle meeting. That and more adjustments came, running a total of 450 basis points to address the surging inflation for both 2022 and 2023.

By December last year, the year-on-year monthly inflation fell within the target at 3.9 percent. For the first six months of this year, inflation averaged 3.5 percent. The new BSP leadership should also be commended for keeping its focus on price stability even as various quarters called for a monetary policy reversal in order to stimulate the credit market and stimulate economic activities. 

It is not correct to suggest that today, the BSP should have eased monetary policy because one, it is using lagging indicators; two, monetary policy has lagged effects of about 18 months; and three, inflation data masks cumulative effects of previous price movements.

In reality, the BSP sets its monetary stance not by looking at the past, but by looking into the future based on its forecasts for the next two years. Whatever monetary steps taken today would not be felt tomorrow or the following week, but over a period of about 18 months. Previous inflation rates are monitored because they are useful in discerning how the previous decisions fanned out. Finally, because inflation eats into the purchasing power especially among the daily wage earners among us, the BSP has to be stubbornly committed to win the war against inflation. Due to dominant upward risks, the BSP was correct in keeping its tight monetary policy until today.

After all, the impact on growth has been quite manageable. High inflation discourages personal consumption which accounts for around three quarters of GDP. 

Well, what the BSP could have avoided was its press statement on a possible early easing ahead of the US Fed that rattled the FX market and sent the peso past the ₱58 to a dollar exchange rate. Given the exchange rate pass through, and if prolonged, that could have some inflationary consequences. At the time, the BSP’s risk-adjusted forecasts exceeded the target.

On non-monetary measures, high mark is impossible. Food, especially rice, production is not sufficient, farmers’ productivity remains low. The ax should fall squarely on the Department of Agriculture, National Irrigation Authority, DTI and other relevant government agencies. We have yet to see a coherent food security program. No wonder for June alone, food inflation continued to be high at 6.5 percent, no farther away from the previous year’s 6.7 percent. Rice inflation remained double digit at 22.5 percent. 

There is an Interagency Committee on Inflation and Market Outlook. Its mandate is clear: address supply and logistics issues including measures to combat immoral and illegal profiteering. They have yet to deliver. For instance, it took eternity to get the tariff duties on imported rice reduced from 35 percent to 15 percent. 

A few words about public finance. There was so much in the 2023 and 2024 national budgets that could have funded priority infrastructure in agriculture and industry as well as in research and development, education and skills retraining programs that could have easily translated into higher economic growth and perhaps better supply outcome, something good for inflation management. Fiscal consolidation is also crucial because the fiscal space is slim; excessive spending could reignite higher demand pressure. This could compromise price stability. For this metric, fair score is fair.

35,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"The IMF’s Tobias Adrian talked about 10 metrics aimed at helping central banks (CBs) and policy makers fortify CBs independence. Adrian was quick to point out that “this is the first new CB independence index in 30 years.”

These 10 metrics are: CB governor’s independence from the executive; CB’s governing body’s independence from the executive; budgetary independence from the legislature; monetary policy independence from the executive; primacy of price stability; long-term direct lending to the government; short-term lending to the government; financial independence; lending outside the financial system; state audit bodies role in ensuring operational efficiency of CBs.

He admitted to his audience at the Bank of Thailand in mid-June that many of these self-explanatory metrics are based on existing indices with new variables introduced including financial and budgetary independence, board composition, and the role of state audit bodies. Based on the views of central bankers themselves, Adrian stressed that the most critical component of CB independence is financial independence. To them, the least important is short-term lending to the government.

In the Philippines, one can only imagine what would happen to the independence of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) if it were to ask Congress for annual appropriation, or seek additional capital. Members of Congress could even investigate the Monetary Board why it has kept interest rate steady for more than a year, or closed an erring bank with strong political backing. 

Good, the 1987 Philippine Constitution explicitly mandated the establishment of an independent central monetary authority and implemented by Republic Act (RA) 7653 of June 14, 1993 by establishing a new autonomous and independent BSP in the same year. After a quarter of a century in 2018, RA 7653 was amended by RA 11211 increasing its capitalization from ₱50 billion to ₱200 billion. 

However, if indeed financial and budgetary independence is most critical, the continued independence of the BSP rests on the complete capitalization from ₱50 billion to ₱200 billion. But after the BSP charter amendment six years ago, only ₱10 billion was added to the BSP’s initial capitalization. With the establishment of the Maharlika Investment Fund, the full capitalization of the BSP could be further delayed because the BSP’s annual dividend that should be reverted to the central bank for capital build-up will instead be diverted to the investment fund up to P50 billion.

But as Adrian would remind us, CB “independence is significantly stronger in the countries where inflation targets are more firmly entrenched in central bank operations.”

Weaknesses are seen at the level of CB management as well as in its budget and financial operations, monetary policy and the prohibition of lending to the government and outside the financial system. Since financial independence is considered most important, any improvements here can offer the bigger “bang for the buck.” He recognized that future legal amendments may be necessary but long and winding. 

Instead, he advised the use of several IMF tools requiring no legislation. The first tool is the IMF Central Bank Transparency Code or CBT released in 2020. The Code has five pillars consisting of transparency in governance, policies, operations, outcome and official relations. Each pillar consists of various components that could guide CBs improve their transparency and communication practices that lead to policy credibility. 

The second tool is stress testing CBs’ balance sheets. Doing this will help them assess their own financial independence. As Adrian clarified, this is particularly helpful for many advanced, and for that matter even emerging, countries that expanded their respective balance sheets due to the exigencies of the pandemic. This should also be useful for CBs with large and active foreign exchange operations that expose them to interest rate and duration risks on their FX securities. Such risks should be properly considered in CB capital policies.

A quote from Adrian should resonate too many CBs “…a deteriorating CB balance sheet would negatively affect profit distribution — ultimately creating fiscal risks, including through the possibility of having to recapitalize the CB.”

We dread the day when CBs have to lobby with their parliaments for additional capitalization. They would be forced to bite the political bullet. 

The last tool is the CB operational efficiency review. This should require the CBs to rationalize their operational costs to achieve efficiency. Policy-related costs are left out but other costs including staffing, procurement, and other logistics costs are benchmarked against best practices. This will encourage CBs to avoid unnecessary expenses especially in staffing and procurement which may be subject to corruption.

While Adrian referred to the 10 metrics as the first in 30 years, an interesting article came out from the World Bank on “Measuring the Independence of Central Banks and Its Effect on Policy Outcomes” by Alex Cukierman, Steven Webb and Bilin Neyapti 32 years ago in 1992. They developed four measures: legal index; rate of turnover of CB governors; index based on a questionnaire answered by specialists in 23 countries; and an aggregation of the legal index and the rate of turnover. 

Their interesting finding: legal independence is not inversely proportional to inflation in developing countries but it is the rate of turnover of CB governors which turned out to be a better proxy for CB independence. 

We cannot therefore resist the temptation to conclude with the World Bank’s quote of Arnold Lobel’s 1972 comics: “Frog and Toad Together:”

“Willpower is trying hard not to do something that you really want to do,” said Frog.

“You mean like trying not to eat all these cookies,” asked Toad.

“Right,” said Frog. He put all the cookies in a box. “There, now we will not eat any more cookies.”

“But we can open the box,” said Toad.

“That is true,” said Frog. He tied some string around the box. He got a ladder and put the box up on a high shelf. “There, now we will not eat any more cookies.”

“But we can climb the ladder…” ",0
36,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"At the IMF, countries are represented by their central banks in the International Monetary and Financial Committee while the finance or development ministers constitute the joint Development Committee to advise both the World Bank and the IMF mostly on issues related to economic development in emerging and developing countries. In particular, governance issues of central banks have often been the focus of lively debates at the IMF. 

Just last week, the Fund’s Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department Tobias Adrian guested at the Bank of Thailand’s (BoT) Annual Retreat. His remarks focused on central bank independence and why it’s needed and how to protect it.

Adrian’s appearance at the BoT could not have been more auspicious in the face of a running conflict between Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s efforts “to exert more control over the country’s central bank after repeatedly clashing with the monetary authority on economic policy,” as reported by Bloomberg two weeks ago.

No less than Srettha himself who admitted seeking advice from former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra on economic policy. And what kind of advice would Thaksin give to Srettha on monetary policy, for instance, other than what he demanded from the BoT during his time? Thaksin’s populist streak pushed him to pressure the central bank to adjust monetary policy and prioritize economic growth over the central bank’s mandate to manage inflation.

What is bad for Thailand is that its new leadership right from the start in September 2023 announced that it was aiming to accelerate economic recovery and ease taxpayers’ financial burdens. During the same month, the BoT decided to jack up its policy rate for the 8th straight time to 2.5 percent, the highest in a decade. This tightening mode was sustained at its November 2023 meeting.

Srettha, who is concurrently finance minister, openly requested a rate cut from the start of 2024 and as Nikkei Asia reported, even summoned BoT Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput to his office on Jan. 10. He even disclosed to the media that he suggested to the central bank head to have more frequent coffee even at the BoT headquarters. Nobody can deny it was an open attempt by the head of the Thai government to meddle with the central bank.

But Sethaput who graduated from Yale was not new in the public service. He was more than equipped and experienced to stand his ground that easing monetary policy when inflation remains an issue is just wrong. The BoT kept the rate unchanged at its Feb. 7 meeting.

Recognizing the independence of the BoT did not prevent Srettha from suggesting that “it should not ignore people’s suffering.” The problem with the Thai Prime Minister is that he’s arguing from nothing. He wanted a rate cut because he believed the Thai economy is in crisis. BoT’s view is contrary to Srettha’s: “domestic demand continues to expand…key factors hindering growth outlook to be external and structural.” It’s pointless to reduce interest rates because growth is emasculated by falling exports due to China’s own economic slowdown and low labor productivity. 

The BoT is also concerned that should interest rates are reduced, the Thai baht is likely to weaken. If they start easing before the US Fed, that action could lead to investors dropping Thai assets in favor of foreign assets, and trigger baht selling in a big way. That is inflationary. Srettha does not seem to cover this ground.

Another concern of the BoT is its pride as an independent central bank, something that not all central banks may be steadfast to defend at all costs. Beyond pride, the BoT is correct in its assessment that if the financial market begins to perceive it as being soft on preserving its independence, such could lead to what they call “double baht-selling.” That is injurious to the Thai economy, that is suicide for the central bank. 

Clearly the Thai government appears focused narrowly on short-term stimulus measures because its eyes are on the next election. On the other hand, the central bank and its veteran staff would always be the gatekeepers of long-term stability of the economy. There is bound to be a delineation between politics and economic vision. 

Thus, Adrian’s remarks are timely and they must be inspiring for those in the trenches at the BoT. He had a number of very precious messages to the central bankers in Bangkok.

First, he talked about setting the stage. Central banks face tremendous pressure from politics because as monetary policy had to be tightened due to the post-pandemic inflation, economies slowed down, unemployment rose and fiscal position worsened. Their balance sheets bloated by the amount of support they extended to their governments. The financial institutions that they regulate are now demanding that they should also live up to the same standards of governance, risk management and transparency that central banks require of them.

Second, independence remains necessary even as some sectors called for greater oversight of central banks. Who supervises central banks? Empirical evidence is clear that higher central bank independence is associated with lower inflation.

Adrian quoted the US Council of Economic Advisers’ blog about the US Fed as a classic example of the supreme value of independence. Even as actual consumer price inflation had exceeded the target two percent, inflation expectation has broadly been steady at two percent because the US Fed is perceived to be independent and therefore its monetary policy remains credible and effective in combatting inflation.

What are the metrics of an independent central bank?

In his remarks, Adrian indicated that together with his co-authors, Lev Menand of Columbia University and Ashraf Khan of the IMF, they collaborated to produce a new global index for central bank independence. Ten metrics have been developed aimed at helping central banks and policy makers strengthen central bank independence. (To be concluded next week).",0
37,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Certainly it was exhilarating news last Sunday, that decision of Fitch Ratings to affirm the Philippines’ investment grade rating at BBB, a notch above the minimum investment grade. Equally significant is the stable outlook that Fitch maintained for the country.


Such a rating action of one of the three major credit rating agencies rewards us for all the efforts of government, business and the rest of the civil society to address the debilitating economic scarring of the pandemic a few years ago and to come to grips with the thinning fiscal space. We did not do badly in achieving respectable economic growth, bringing down inflation and mopping up slippages in public finance.


The marching order  is to deliver on this recent favorable credit rating.


Fitch has a list of the Philippines’ macro strengths as well as structural weaknesses. Keeping the BBB label and stable outlook  means Fitch recognizes our strong medium-term growth. The significance of such an outlook hinges on our ability to reduce government debt to GDP ratio in the next few years. And for us, the imperative of securing cheap and reliable energy, good governance, strong connectivity throughout the islands and optimizing our demographic advantage.


What sets us back? 


We have a low GDP per capita which signals sustained demand for resources to fund various social amelioration projects away from infrastructure and to us, debt servicing ability. Fitch also argues that governance standards are weaker than those of its BBB peers even as it agrees World Bank indicators of good governance could be overdoing it.


On growth prospects, Fitch shares the World Bank’s cautious optimism with its 5.8-percent GDP forecast for 2024. It was correct for Fitch to have attributed last year’s slowdown to the growth-boosting, pandemic-mitigating public expenditure and high inflation. Spending on the pandemic is dissipating this year while high price pressure restrained private consumption and investment. While El Niño could be bad for agriculture, power and water supply as it was, La Niña could also limit business activities in the second half of 2024. 


The challenge to our policymakers? 


Fitch expects this medium-term expectation to be supported by what it calls “large” investment in infra and reforms to foster trade and investment, including renewed interest in public-private partnership (PPP). 


A good plank to this positive growth outlook is gradual fiscal consolidation. Fiscal sustainability ensures continued infrastructure and social services that all should result in stronger business activities. Higher fiscal deficit is not per se bad, as long as growth is secured and a fiscal consolidation plan is in place. Well, the Philippines is into it, and the remaining task is to pursue it, and pursue it well.
Fitch in this latest watch believes “there is some risk of a further fiscal slippage given the government’s continued focus on economic growth and the approach of mid-term elections in May 2025.” Fitch implicitly hopes that the focus on tax administration will produce good results.


We have time and again pointed out that keeping public spending at 60 percent of GDP, or below, secures our overall economic well-being. This is basically the same message of Fitch to the authorities. If this is delivered, then Fitch is justified in saying that our debt profile is stable. 


On external payments position, Fitch zeroed in on the current account deficit which is indicative of an emerging country’s reliance on foreign saving. Fitch says it is narrowing, and its expectation is that it will drop to below 2.0 percent of GDP by next year from last year’s 2.6 percent. This is very achievable with the continuing growth of the economy and the harnessing of indigenous, renewable power sources. 


Fitch also considered the country’s external financing as favorable because it comes from long-term borrowing and foreign direct investment (FDI). The latest good news is that our gross international reserves (GIR) hit a historic high of $105 billion in May. This should further convince the credit rating agency of the country’s strong ability to repay its external obligations.


For obvious reason, Fitch recognized that inflation pressures are moderating. While upside risks continue to threaten price stability, the BSP’s initial success in inflation management was apparent with the sustained retreat of core inflation since 2023 up to May 2024. Contrary to some views, the BSP’s hawkish monetary policy is yielding good results. The challenge is to intensify on those non-monetary measures including stronger supply chains and lower but time-varying tariff duties on imported commodities.


Fitch also commended the BSP’s inflation-targeting framework and flexible exchange-rate regime. They are sound, and they are credible. The government’s use of BSP resources during the pandemic was controlled and shortly reversed while the calls for generalized fuel subsidies were justifiably resisted.   


Finally, Fitch observed that the Marcos Jr. administration “has continued to advance structural economic reforms with the overarching aim of catalyzing private investment.” Much space for growth has been gained with the improvements introduced in the PPP law, Foreign Investment Act and Public Service Act. If this commitment to sustain game-changing economic reforms is upheld, we have a good chance of going back to the old growth path prior to the pandemic of 2020.


Fitch rating action also showed some rating sensitivities. In the first place, a stable outlook means stable, neither an upgrade nor a downgrade is forthcoming. But the stable outlook could also turn positive if strong adherence to macroeconomic sustainability is maintained, fiscal and debt metrics show constant improvements relative to GDP and finally, governance standards are firmed up. 


While this recent affirmation from Fitch is good news, the challenge is without doubt to deliver on those macroeconomic concerns that could bring about better future for our country and people. 


There is an enchanting whole new world of difference when we are rated A or A-. It means we have attained that level of growth that job opportunities are more plentiful and lower inflation promotes higher purchasing power for our people. ",0
38,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"It was the American political scientist Hans Morgenthau who proposed that the word “equilibrium” is equivalent to “balance.” Nothing is more important than ensuring the stability of the whole while preserving the independence of its components. In its global application, we have an equilibrium when nations are not only independent, but they are also entitled to exist. 

From its perspective, China believes regional stability may be preserved despite the assertion of its territorial claims over parts of the South China Sea that belong to and are within the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. That is not just bullying, it is also an outright violation of the UN Charter that prohibits “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”

Ironically, the UN Security Council can play double standard, or engage in doublespeak, by a unilateral veto of any intervention even against their own belligerent action. We saw this type of violations by the United States’ invasion of Iraq, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its war against Ukraine, and of course, China’s hostile presence in the South China Sea. National sovereignty was without question violated without any obvious consequence. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China can seem to get away with its territorial adventurism. 

As proof, China dismissed the 2016 arbitral ruling in favor of the Philippines “null and void.” In fact, China continues to deal with maritime visitors in the South China Sea with lasers and water cannons. It has standing regulation authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain “trespassers” to its claimed territories including the traditional fishing ground of Filipino fishermen. 

What is pathetic is China’s argument that it is the Philippines that is compromising regional stability by involving another great power. China badly needs shadows and mirrors to realize it is arguing on technicality. When a big power like China can afford to ignore rules-based arbitral ruling and insist on its own definition of what falls under its own territorial jurisdiction, the only way to prevent territorial adventurism is precisely to establish international alliances. Without such a counterweight, China could very well secure a wholesale title over practically the whole of South China Sea.

China could afford to throw its weight around the world because since 1978 when it started to open up to the world, its GDP growth has averaged more than nine percent every year. Over 800 million Chinese people have literally escaped absolute poverty. China is now the largest exporter in the world, a global factory no less. 

At the conclusion of China’s Article IV consultation a week ago, First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath could not have been clearer in describing China’s economic development over the past few decades as remarkable.

With a country of over 1.4 billion people, China is the world’s second biggest market. Its land area covers five time zones and occupies borders with some 14 countries. The world’s third largest country in land area, China is now the second largest economy in nominal output and the largest economy based on purchasing power parity. China is credited with having grown its nominal gross output from just over $150 billion in 1978 to around$18 trillion in 2023. 

It's no puzzle then if China should nurture some ambition to challenge the US’ global leadership. In naval power, China between 2014 and 2018 alone succeeded in launching more vessels than the total number of ships in the German, Indian, Spanish and British navies combined, as Foreign Policy wrote in 2020. 

Xi Jinping’s announcement of a “new era” in 2017 meant that China must “take center stage in the world.” Establishing regional hegemony is a crucial step and this implies that China must assert itself as the dominant player in the Western Pacific. We now see China exerting strong influence in security and economic affairs in the region and neutralizing US alliances. The South China Sea is an excellent showcase of its growing weight in the region and its aspiration in the larger global stage.

But there is one thing that could go wrong for China.

It is their ability to manage the strong headwinds of aging population, weaker investment, and geo-economic fragmentation. These big picture issues translate into slow growth, weak exports and currency, and a deepening property sector crisis. Governance remains an existential issue. With growth dynamics strongly entrenched in China with its extensive and deepening capital markets, China should be able to overcome these risks.

But if China fails the economic test, its global posture may be considered to be nothing more than a paper tiger.

But there is another thing that could go well for China.

It is the US and its western allies themselves. Recently, former IMF Economic Counsellor Raghuram Rajan correctly observed that “the Western alliance itself is fraying.” Self-interest is driving the weakening consensus on economic direction. The US itself, while demanding openness in trade and finance, is doing so based on its own definition of openness. Doublespeak can be easily discerned and it could undermine the US and its Western allies including those in the Asia Pacific.

If this shift in economic power is to be reflected in the IMF and World Bank governance through an appropriate adjustment in country quotas, China may ultimately end up with the largest quota and of course, more extensive influence. Rajan pointed out that under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the Fund’s headquarters may have to move from Washington, DC to Beijing. 

If the Fund persists in its tradition of reforming itself incrementally through modest adjustment in quotas without fundamental changes in governance and management structure, then Beijing would have another platform to pursue its global ambition.

Whether this is going to lead to better political equilibrium will be an open question for some years to come.",0
39,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Some TikToks say it all. To afford a rare McLaren 620R, worth at least $280,000 or more than ₱16 million, one should get used to living in a farm and running a piggery business. Prepare to live a simple life, grow with your father’s workers and yes, do homeschooling. After a few years, branded jewelry, bags, and dresses worth millions of pesos would complete your ensemble as you ride your own chopper after winning a local election in a small town north of Luzon.

Many have been monitoring the Senate hearing and from all the public declarations of Mayor Alice Guo of Bamban, Tarlac, that is her story. That is her life. Change the details here and there like the McLaren that she said she just borrowed, but keep the details about the simple farm life of her childhood with no personal recollection of her playmates and the mother Amelia Leal that she never saw, and that’s Mayor Guo’s 38 years. 

To be sure, there were more questions than answers that our senators elicited from the Bamban mayor.

Why she could not establish her origin escapes us. She could not recall who raised her up as a youngster,or who taught her at home except a certain Teacher Rubilyn. Her birth was registered only when she was 17, but there was no record of where she was actually born because hospital records are non-existent. Her residential address at best was fictitious. While she claimed her family had embroidery business in Valenzuela, a quick search revealed no such business was ever conducted there. She indicated a home address in Valenzuela but no less than Senator Sherwin Gatchalian belied it. Someone he knew owned the place. Most damning, both the couple whom she claimed as her parents have no existing birth and marriage records in the Philippine Statistics Authority. Whatever questions were thrown at her, Mayor Guo invariably insisted she grew up in the farm, and she lived a simple life.

As Senator Loren Legarda quipped, “para namang may script.”

But the script, although it looks expansive, was rather weak and incoherent because there remained many loose ends in Mayor Guo’s narrative.  Securities and Exchange Commission records show she’s one of the incorporators holding substantial shareholdings in at least 11 companies since 2010. Allegedly born in July 1986, that means she was only about 24 years old when she amassed so much to have organized such a business network. She acquired a helicopter in 2019 at age 33 for an air taxi business but gave it up when the prospects did not reportedly prove promising. She also engaged in car dealership which she allegedly used to justify her ownership of 16 vehicles even as they remained under her name.

Her Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) showed very rapid increase in her net worth. The script failed to provide the mayor with the answer to the questions of the senators on how she accumulated higher net worth in such a short time. 

Let’s be real, we can do a thousand iterations of the piggery or embroidery businesses, car dealership or similar business activities but no way could they yield a combined income to allow Mayor Guo to afford expensive jewelry and much less to finance the purchase of a chopper even for business that ultimately failed, and the 10 hectares of land on which POGO operators built a whole hub of gambling complex.

Before she ran for mayor of Bamban, Guo in September 2020 applied for a license to operate Hongsheng Gaming Technology, Inc. Before she was elected mayor, she claimed she divested from the business. When the same technology company was raided, it had rebranded itself as Zun Yuan Technology. During that raid, a Ford Expedition belonging to Guo was found. Electric bills of the Zun Yuan premises totalling some ₱15 million were charged to Guo herself and that covered the period as recent as September 2023 to February 2024.

Perhaps the script failed to anticipate the discovery of the so-called illegal activities at the POGO hub in Bamban in March 2024. What is suspicious here is that Zun Yuan was located in the Baofu compound just behind the Bamban municipal hall where the mayor holds office. Baofu Land Development that leased the compound to Zun Yuan is owned by no other than the mayor herself. The complex consists of 32 building structures with a reported tunnel structure as an escape route. 

Why the mayor did not even bother to check the extensive POGO operations in her own property is a puzzle to many. The raid established that illegal activities such as human trafficking and illegal detention were done in the mayor’s property. Official reports showed that there are torture chambers in the complex, panic rooms, vaults containing millions of pesos and dollars with confiscated passports of foreign employees. The Bamban POGO was reported doing other business outside its license. Cyber fraud operations were suspected to have been committed.

What is left unsaid, and perhaps it was supposed to be in the subtext of the players rather than in the script, is the motivation of Guo in running for mayor of a second-class municipality where the POGO operations had been in full blast. 

If we go by costs and benefits, it was argued in the Senate that the social and economic costs due to POGO including crimes, tax evasion, foregone foreign direct investments and tourism at some ₱143.3 billion far outweigh the benefits estimated at ₱134.86 billion for allowing POGO. Net cost to the country is more than ₱8.4 billion. 

That is the paradox of POGO but somebody else wrote the script for us.",0
40,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Bloomberg and online news last Tuesday reported a closing rate of ₱58.27 to a dollar, nearly the same level it did on Nov. 8, 2022, and the worst in 18 months. BSP Governor Eli Remolona emailed media  to explain that “the peso weakened beyond ₱58 to the US dollar today, in line with other currencies in the region. The dollar continued to strengthen as the Federal Reserve signaled delay in cutting interest rates.” 

The governor captured the immediate dynamics of the peso’s weakness but there are more to it, and some could be traced back to the BSP itself.

First of all, no one can fault the US central bank for suggesting that rates may remain higher for longer. It is correct to stay tight because the US economy is robust and resilient, humming with the stock market, while domestic inflation has so far proved stickier at around three percent against the two percent target. 

But we read a different story from the broadsheets last Friday.

The BSP announced that it may start cutting interest rates as early as August for a total of 50 basis points (bps), as “recent inflation uptick was not as bad as expected.” To many observers and media reporters, such a statement sounded less hawkish even after the Monetary Board kept the policy rate steady at 6.5 percent.

Such a statement is not exactly in synch with the BSP press statement issued after the Board meeting the day before. Its penultimate paragraph could not be more than hawkish: “The Monetary Board deems it appropriate to ensure sufficiently tight monetary policy settings until inflation settles firmly within the target range. A restrictive policy stance will also help keep inflation expectations anchored amid a possible buildup in upside risks to future inflation.” 

As to its institutional commitment, the BSP press statement could not have been more steadfast in reiterating that it “remains ready to adjust its monetary policy settings as necessary, in keeping with its primary mandate to safeguard price stability.”

But to say that the BSP “still has room to cut rates before the US Federal Reserve,” up to a possible 50 bps may confirm that the MB meeting was “dovish.” The market’s demand for US dollar soared and we ended up the other day with the peso’s weakest showing in 18 months. 

It is not impossible for some to speculate that monetary policy is less worried about inflation than the prospects of growth. After all, the Development Budget Coordination Committee recently announced lower growth targets of 6 percent-7 percent for 2024 and 6.5 percent-7.5 percent for 2025. 

And domestic inflation seems to be about to break through the inflationary spiral of March 2022-November 2023 with the less-than-expected inflation of 3.8 percent in April 2024. If the May 2024 inflation should turn out less than 4.0 percent, then one can safely say price pressures are losing steam, and the issue boils down to how much stronger are the upside risks the BSP identified during last week’s policy meeting.

As proof, the BSP announced risk-adjusted inflation forecasts of 3.8 percent for 2024 and 3.7 percent for 2025 from 4.0 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. With these solid forecasts, the BSP could have dwelt more on the favorable dynamics of inflation and the impending success of hitting the target after two years. Issuing instead a forward guidance of an August easing when the US Fed looks keen on staying higher for longer is bad timing. After all, a risk-adjusted forecast of 3.8 percent for this year is not exactly “benign.” In our previous lingo at the Board in times past, it is “manageable.” 

If the risks identified as upside risks amplify themselves beyond programmed magnitude, the upper end of the target could easily be breached. 

And here’s the rub: telegraphing to the market the likelihood of an easier monetary policy in the next few months was enough to upset the foreign exchange (FX) market. Therefore, the crash of the peso beyond ₱58 is not exactly unexpected. Moreover, the situation turned for the worse when the BSP admitted that it was intervening less. Unless the BSP once again affirms its strong commitment to checking market volatility and ensuring order in the FX market, the breach in the ₱58 line in the sand could be further extended.

If the peso further weakens over a prolonged period, the exchange rate pass through could begin to kick in, and inflationary tendencies may resurge. What is “manageable” risk-adjusted forecasts for 2024 and 2025 could be easily beaten. Nobody fancies this. 

Yesterday’s report about the country’s April balance of payments deficit of $639 million from March’s surplus of $1.2 billion does not inspire a stable peso. The shortfall derives from the government’s massive debt repayments. Cash remittances from our overseas workers are at best anemic. And the deficit is not true only for the month of April; the first four months of the year also yielded a deficit. 

It would not also help the peso and inflation if at this time that monetary policy should remain cautious against a tight US Fed to talk about a possible reduction in the required reserve ratio (RRR) from 9.5 percent to a possible five percent. That will release hundreds of billions of pesos into the monetary stream. True, a high RRR is distortionary of financial intermediation. But its expansionary effects cannot be discounted at this time when aiming for a lower inflation is still imperative.

On the other hand, the market may wish to read the emerging scenario with more care and give the BSP more credit that it is now seeing an early victory against inflation. Our monetary authorities may just be too excited to share to the business community what it intends to do once inflation is firmly under control, reduce policy rate and then by lowering the RRR, infuse the market with more money.

41,Jose Ma Montelibano,"The excitement surrounding gold and bronze medals, as well as the near-misses, has reached its peak. The first half of August has brought us more golden moments than ghostly ones, which I consider a true blessing. Now that we are in the second half of the month, the character of August is beginning to shift back to its traditional atmosphere.

The weather has been relatively mild, with no typhoons so far in August, thanks to July, which preemptively took the brunt of Typhoon Carina early on. We have experienced a few thunderstorms, but that is just typical for this time of year. This month, I’ve monitored two earthquakes so far: one in Surigao del Sur and the other off Northern Bohol. However, perhaps the more concerning issue is Taal Volcano, which has been emitting volcanic smog (or vog). Kanlaon Volcano remains restless but has been calmer since its disturbances two months ago.

What is turning increasingly sour is the political landscape, particularly the escalating feud between the Marcos and Duterte families. This conflict has sparked speculation that extends beyond mere politics, hinting at misgovernance and crime. I’ve read about congressmen pushing for the Commission on Audit (COA) to audit or disclose its findings regarding the hundreds of millions in confidential funds under the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education. Furthermore, there is tension surrounding the Vice President’s complaint about the reduction of her security detail, which has been cut from over 400 personnel to just over 300.

The more sensational news revolves around revelations from a former Customs Intelligence officer, who claims that after apprehending a large quantity of imported shabu, he was arrested and imprisoned. There is also a video from a press conference in which former President Duterte angrily and publicly orders the arrest of the Customs officer. Today, allegations suggest that the Duterte family has been involved in the importation of shabu along with controversial Chinese nationals. Adding to the troubles of August, the Bureau of Immigration reported that former mayor Alice Guo, a suspected non-Filipino citizen who managed to run for and be elected, has left the country without passing through border controls. Even more troubling is the possibility that Alice Guo might have been entering and exiting the Philippines without the knowledge of immigration and border officials. Golden moments are quickly overshadowed by embarrassing incidents, all courtesy of the pervasive corruption eroding the foundations of our governance and noble culture.

As I write this, we are in that part of August 2024 when a super blue moon lights up the sky. A super blue moon occurs due to the combination of three astronomical events: a full moon, a supermoon, and a blue moon. According to NASA, this rare alignment happens when the different cycles of blue and supermoons coincide on the calendar.

What is technical or cosmic in nature is not only beautiful to behold but also sparks many other conversations, particularly in astrology. Special meanings are ascribed to unique astronomical coincidences, and I cannot fault those who believe there is something magical or spiritual about full moons in general, and super blue moons in particular. Nature has a way of reminding us, through its beauty or power, that there is much we still do not comprehend. We do know, however, that full moons are truly a sight to see and that the moon’s movement affects ocean tides.

In our ignorance of the full context and role of the moon in earthly life, we tend to dismiss its significance—unless one is connected to life around the ocean and seashores. Or, in that ignorance, we speculate about hidden meanings, both spiritual and occult, using our intuition or imagination.

Ignorance often drives people to act in ways that can be irrational or even foolish. When we lack understanding, we feel insecure, leading us to create configurations of life that ease that insecurity. Too often, we follow blindly, either a cult leader or a herd. One thing is certain: we cannot help but speculate, even gossip, simply to vent our fears. Many politicians or religious leaders have exploited this throughout history, profiting and gathering armies of followers by tapping into the fears of the uninformed.

In more recent times, however, there are fewer spellbinders and religious fanatics, mainly because money has overtaken many of them. Money has taken on god-like powers because society has decreed it so, placing it as the primary value in life. Money is now considered the master key to all problems, replacing the deity we once revered. Our traditional value system has become warped and is now centered around money as the ultimate goal. This distortion persists until death becomes imminent and undeniable, coupled with the growing realization that money cannot halt our mortality.

The ascendancy of money is proportional to the descendancy of our capability to stand on our two feet from the power of what we can do ourselves. The more we do not know how to fend for ourselves, the more we depend on money to do it for us. This weakness is what makes the world go round, as the old saying goes, as money is the tail that wags the dog. It is pitiful to witness the way money has risen to capture mankind over my lifetime, but it is a bitter reality that must be admitted.

In the true sense, there is no learning poverty among our young. Children by divine or natural design are like sponges – they learn whether they try to or not. If there is now a measured “learning poverty” among them, it is directly proportional to the poverty of teaching – meaning what is taught is poor, impoverished, severely lacking in quality and in spirit. This is, to my mind, the greatest challenge before us today, how to undo the artificiality of the life we live and discard the alternative reality dominating us.",0
42,Jose Ma Montelibano,"August, the ghost month. I always thought it must have been the Chinese influence on our local culture, but Google says that the ghost month is part of the traditional belief systems of several other Asian countries as well. According to these beliefs, the ghost month is when the doors of the spirit world are opened, and the restless spirits search for peace, prayers, or pleasure in the earthly realm.

What complements and deepens the belief in the ghost month is that August often brings heavy rains or typhoons, resulting in floods. The ghost month is typically wet, gloomy, and inhospitable. The climate enhances the eerie atmosphere of August, as if nature itself is warning us to be cautious and to stay indoors, given the challenging weather conditions.

However, there were signs that August 2024 would be different from the typical ghost month.

Typhoon Carina arrived early, bringing torrential and record-setting rains and floods, and setting a gloomy tone after a relatively well-delivered presidential speech during the SONA had eased the negativity in the air. But that was in July, not August. Instead, August began with a bang. From being ghostly, it turned golden, thanks to Caloy Yulo, who won two gold medals. Female boxers Nesty Petecio and Ain Villegas contributed two bronze medals, bringing the Philippines’ total to four Olympic medals—the most in our Olympic history.  I know there were disappointments too, but winning medals at the Olympics is no easy feat. EJ Obiena and Bianca Pagdanganan came close to adding two more bronze medals, but fate was not kind to them. Neither were the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) and the National Golf Association of the Philippines (NGAP), which failed to provide our national golfers, Bianca and Dottie Arbina, with their uniforms. They provided many excuses, but none justified the embarrassment our golfers faced while having to paste the Philippine flag on their personal T-shirts.

Anyway, what an August this has been so far—so opposite its reputation—and I am thankful. At the same time, August still remains the ghost month, with two more weeks to go. I suggest we stay careful and cautious, even if we do not wish to focus on the negatives. The world is turbulent; it is not just the spirits who seek peace. The Middle East is a hot global flashpoint, the Russia-Ukraine war continues, and the West Philippine Sea remains troublesome for Asia.

The situation on the home front is equally troubling. The rivalries between the Marcoses and Dutertes are escalating in intensity and becoming increasingly contentious. It’s an unusual conflict arising from two partners who recently achieved success in winning the presidency and vice-presidency. However, a third of the electorate believes that the Commission on Elections (Comelec) secured this victory through a seemingly miraculous Smartmatic system. Lacking technical expertise, I reserve my condemnation on this matter. Nevertheless, I previously highlighted the illegitimacy of the 2022 elections due to widespread vote-buying.

While the two-thirds, amounting to approximately 31 million voters, who claim to have supported Marcos and Duterte are becoming embroiled in a deepening conflict, I take solace in the fact that the minimum of 15 million voters for Leni are choosing to remain detached from the struggles of the deeply divided Uniteam. They should continue to distance themselves from this escalating dispute, which could potentially turn deadly. It is enough for these 15 million to uphold their integrity, thereby fostering honesty, transparency, and accountability in their own lives.

In times of chaos, we must ground ourselves and our families in fundamental survival principles within a spirit of bayanihan. Very few among us are wealthy enough to comfortably weather sudden upheavals. We must safeguard our food supply, strive to produce as much as possible, and work together to establish a more localized food network.

If we pay attention, we notice that government projects are now often worth tens or even hundreds of billions. There isn’t much we can do about that except hope that project costs are inflated by no more than 30% since the rumored kickback is around 40%.

While some individuals can engage actively in anti-corruption initiatives, most of us should focus our efforts closer to home. Embrace sustainable practices and grow your food wherever possible. Those in the majority who face financial hardships can mitigate the effects of inflation by cultivating as much of their own food as they can.

By taking charge of our own needs instead of relying on others, we can also teach younger generations to be resourceful. A resurgence of the Do-It-Yourself culture must begin with food production. Being self-sufficient empowers us, ultimately fostering confidence and resilience. Our children and grandchildren will not learn these essential skills unless we pass them on. They are already victims of what is termed “learning poverty,” which naturally indicates an equivalent poverty in teaching.

There is a long list of things that are already wrong that can get worse, but that is not our focus in this article. Rather, like our athletes who made it against the worse of odds, we must try to go for the gold, too. We have waited for our leaders to solve our problems and, as a result, we have dug our own holes deeper. There is no Tallano gold, no 20 peso/kg rice, and no Uniteam – only budol after budol.

I pray, sooner than later, that we understand how the brighter tomorrow is in our hands first before the leaders try it themselves. But if we fail, I believe that they, too, will fail.",0
43,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I was with friends when the news of Caloy Yulo winning his first gold medal was announced. Immediately, the euphoria began. We could not help it; it felt like rain after a long, painful drought. I do not think it was just a drought of Olympic medals, even if gold. We know that we are up against the elite athletes of the whole world in their own unique arena – the Olympics. We want the gold like everyone else, but we know it is not a matter of entitlement, not something we can expect as a matter of right. That is why, when we get it, like Caloy got it for us, we celebrate like crazy – one of our own is the best among the best.

Our euphoria, however, was much more than that. Yes, Caloy’s first gold triggered it, but there was a dam about to burst and it did. Beyond sports, many Filipinos have long been in a painful drought. It is hard to put in words because then, they would sound partisan, as though the drought is only a matter of politics. No, it is not. It is more than politics, it is more than economics; it is everything that we call a better Philippines, the search for what is good and right, for peace and harmony, and freedom from poverty and the cesspool of exploitation that blankets the country.

The one thing about living long enough and being observant for most of it is that I see aspects of reality not as random events but as parts of continuing threads. This capacity is not mine alone but for every Filipino who remembers, looks, thinks, and can connect the dots, as they say. Vicious cycles remain both vicious and cycles only because the pain from experiencing them is not learned or quickly forgotten. Those who use the political slogan “Never Again” must be aware of how inutile it is for people who forget and cannot connect the dots.

It takes a deliberate decision to pursue what should be a common dream for all citizens after that dream is frustrated again and again. Septuagenarians like me, no matter how much of an activist we may have been earlier in life, also tire, also despair, also want to give up. We have witnessed the vicious cycles more times than we care to count, and it makes us wonder if reason and intelligence are truly natural features of humans. I have wondered for a long time, and I only know that I cannot count on the consistency of these great faculties. One thing that I have always counted on is the idealism of the young. It is like a guaranteed gift, a divine safety mechanism against the weakness of man when tempted by greed or lust for power. And, by the way, I do not mean only public officials, whether elected or appointed. In a democracy, the majority of citizens have to enable the greedy and power-hungry. In our democracy, the majority of citizens have truly empowered them. There may be a variety of reasons, but ultimately, citizens have empowered the greedy and power-hungry.

Staying in a democracy that needs us badly to be the citizens that a democracy needs forces us to find our hopes and aspirations in the nobility of our young. From birth to teenage years, the fire of idealism is a natural force. However, it is not invincible. During this same period, idealism is exposed to the harsher realities of life. It may be material poverty and the squalor it festers in that inflates our animalistic nature rather than grows our humanity. More deadly, though, is the squalor of corrupt values and the behavior they engender.

Understanding this as one cycle I have observed in the decades I have lived, it now makes me doubt if all the activism for good governance and good citizenship is worth pursuing. The dramatic shift of societal values from our traditional ones to the dominant ascendancy of money and power cannot be restrained simply by a Constitution, no matter how idealistic it is. In fact, the more idealistic the Constitution is, the more impossible it becomes to adhere to.

There remains only the natural idealism of our young before they lose it to compromise and the need to survive in a materialistic world. Nurturing that idealism is becoming more urgent as the strongest prevention against perennial corruption and poverty. Strange as it may seem, the greedy and corrupt try to hide their dirty ways from their own young as long as they can. Advocacy to nourish the young’s idealism should have more open access to them with the least resistance from the evildoers of society.

This idealism is being unnaturally weakened by the very system we had hoped would strengthen it – mass education. That is why I am so focused on learning poverty, especially that part which measures our almost total failure in developing among our young students the capacity to grasp instructions. I am much less concerned with language, math, and even science as subjects. It is this incapacity to grasp instructions that stunts the development of the body, emotions, and mind. We risk losing the vaunted Filipino trait that has made us resilient against man and nature – diskarte or resourcefulness.

I acknowledge the remarkable achievements of Caloy Yulo and all other athletes who have elevated our national pride before the world. I congratulate them, and I am grateful to them. I have celebrated, enjoyed the moment of victory as though my own, too.

Now, I must remain focused on the 91% of public-school students who are victims of learning poverty. Even amidst the victories and celebrations brought to us by selected heroes of the moment, I cannot shake the thought of this 91% of the Filipino public-school students and the bleak future they face. It is to them and their liberation from ignorance or incapacity that we must dedicate more of our lives.",0
44,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I chose to write this article well before my weekly deadline. My mind is full of thoughts that I don’t want to let fade away once the current crisis is over. I recall September 25-26, 2009, when Typhoon Ondoy devastated Metro Manila and surrounding provinces, dumping a record amount of rain. Who could have imagined that Typhoon Carina would follow in Ondoy’s footsteps and even surpass it in rainfall?

Fifteen years ago, I was younger and more able to actively participate in Gawad Kalinga’s relief operations. What I witnessed was heart-wrenching. It wasn’t just the extent of the damage; it was who was affected and why. Typhoon Carina’s impact was no different—it was the poor who bore the brunt.

As always, there is widespread criticism of government inefficiency and possibly neglect. This pattern remains unchanged from 15 years ago. While there are now more details about the 5,500 flood control projects that were not there in 2009, the response remains similar. Government reactions, including Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s focus on trash and climate change as primary causes, are superficial. The root causes are deeper and more complex, which is why the flooding in Metro Manila will persist beyond his term.

Trash is merely a consequence, not a root cause. It exacerbates other issues. While the poor communities along riverbanks are often blamed for the trash, we must ask a crucial question: Why are they there? Riverbanks, canals, seashores, and crevices are not suitable for habitation, yet millions of Filipinos have settled there. They only end up being displaced when natural or man-made disasters strike, such as fires in the slums. But they will return, as they have in the past. Some slums in Metro Manila have been there for 50 years or more.

The reason they are there is straightforward: they have nowhere else to go to survive. The next question is: Where did they come from?

Many are survivors of previous calamities in their home provinces, mainly in the Visayas and Bicol, which are frequently hit by typhoons. When storms, earthquakes, landslides, and floods devastate their communities, hunger drives them to seek work in cities and towns. They leave because they have no other option.

Thus, when discussing calamities, climate change, and trash, we must address poverty. We need to understand the impact of calamities on the poor and how hunger and despair force them to relocate.

Poverty, like flooding, damages lives and property. To address poverty, we must examine who is affected, why, where, and how. Poverty is a consequence of deeper issues, leading us to the root cause: corruption.

Corruption is an insatiable force that consumes everything in its path if given the chance. Addressing Metro Manila’s flooding also means tackling corruption and poverty, not just adapting to climate change.

Looking at corruption and poverty in the Philippines requires a brief historical perspective. In the past, when our population was small and land abundant, the datu system needed people to make land productive. People had real value, while land was less significant.

Colonial rule, however, introduced a greedy master. Colonizers, driven by the desire for loot and bounty, distributed land grants to favored individuals as rewards or in exchange for tribute. Since it was all agricultural then, tribute from people mostly meant what people could produce. Despite the abundance of land, people were all the more necessary for cultivation and tribute. People retained more value over land.

Modernity shifted these dynamics. Advances in science and technology, particularly in reducing infant mortality, led to a population boom. More people served the few elites, who maintained their power and wealth. The elite, both historically and currently, have exploited others. This exploitation, deeply rooted in history, continues to shape our society. And why the term elite still carries a pejorative nuance about it.

Development has followed a master-slave dynamic, making calamities disproportionately destructive to the poor. The zoning laws and their enforcement are suspect, to say the least. They produce comfort for some, luxury for a few, and almost inhuman conditions for most. The real estate developers do not plan for the poor, but the government must. And it never did with a sense of respect and dignity.

Knowing what we have known for decades from our own weather patterns, government and private developers never established clear and equitable zoning principles. Naturally, when the ratio between land and people allows density, even traffic flow is choked – all for money.

Despite the Philippines’ democratic ideals, historical and traditional patterns of superiority and entitlement persist. Until democracy evolves beyond these historical inequalities, the divide will remain, with only superficial gestures toward equality. And we can forget solving floods in a metropolis that continues to defy safety and social risks.

Democracy is not a gift but a challenge. It must be earned, and it requires sacrifice, even the possibility of death. Democracy can be a powerful shield against calamities, poverty, and corruption if it prioritizes the common good over elitism. Intervention towards a sick metropolis can correct extreme anomalies and guide future development to be more friendly to the majority.

The power of democracy lies in the hands of the people, if they choose to seize it. I do not see it coming soon, however, because the people, especially the poor, continue to endure their fate.",0
45,Jose Ma Montelibano,"The Sona is over but the rains and floods are just starting. From a special report card day with a lot of clapping and cheering, it is back to the streets – and the streets are very wet.

I used to remember as a kid that we had longer rain months 70 years ago versus today. It’s either the La Niña phenomenon was occurring quite often then, or global warming has generally shortened the annual periods of rain. Because of that memory in the 50s and 60s, I am less worried about the frequent rains than I am with the longer hot months.

Pagasa today would describe our climate as 6 months wet and six months dry. This ratio is not at all when I remember, and not also how our climate was described decades before. Maybe Wikipedia has a better description that Pagasa, maybe because it can trace global climate records further back in time. Wikipedia claims we have three seasons instead of two, and I think I understand and accept why.

The three seasons are: a hot dry season from March to May, a rainy season from June to November, and a cool dry season from December to February. If I recall correctly, a powerful typhoon visited my hometown one early December in 1951 and devastated Bacolod City among other cities and towns in Central Visayas. The whole roof was blown away and we had to abandon that house. I do not need to recall the names of other typhoons that hit the Philippines on Decembers, Januarys and Februarys. That means the cool dry season described by Wikipedia is too often visited by not only rain but strong typhoons. Perhaps, because of my later advocacy against poverty, I had personally participated in relief and rehabilitation work when typhoons hit from December to February (mostly in the Visayas and Mindanao).

In historical warfare, terrain and weather are the most critical factors. They are matters of life and death that can cause victories or great defeats. But they remain critical factors in our daily lives as Filipinos as well. Between El Niño and La Niña and the pattern of typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions we experience, I am puzzled why our national and local governance do not give terrain and weather the importance they hold over our daily lives.

It is no surprise, then, that we go through the same consequences of disasters that are already part of our national cycle. If we do not put terrain and weather front and center in our daily and annual planning, we are going to get hurt – not the terrain and weather. And it is the poor among us, many more than the official numbers used by the government, that suffer the most.

Since this pattern has been happening since our independence from the USA, the cumulative damage to lives, property, and our way of life is shocking. More than that, it is almost criminal negligence by both national and local governments. Most actions have been reactive, ending up as band aid solutions to recurring threats. I have seen many sea walls put up over the last several decades, standing there as evidence of what appears to be more than just short-term interventions.

It is sad to say but I just have to, not as a way of putting blame on the elite, that the rulers of the country, including the government, never cared enough for the poor majority. The evidence is how we treat the victims of disaster, not just after a calamity, but thereafter as well.

Landlessness was a root problem because of this elitist consciousness in society, as though there was no recognition and appreciation of a divine plan that created a sacred relationship between man and land. For such a God-fearing people, or so claimed by many, a fundamental mandate of survival was belittled, as though the vast majority without wealth or influence can live like birds on a tree or fish in the water.

Man is a mammal, and from a scientific point of view, man is also a mammal that is part of the animal kingdom of the species Homo sapiens. In other words, man needs land and cannot exist without that land as part of his environment. He needs water and air, too, of course, but so far, it is his need for land to survive and develop as a human being that is most threatened, restricted, or denied.

The Filipino poor in my lifetime, or since operational independence in 1946, has been so undervalued that control and free use of land had been denied him. Most Filipinos were squatters, unable to get titles to land where their own ancestors had been born, lived, tilled, and died for centuries. A document overtook the value of human beings, disregarded their natural rights to their ancestral lands, because others a century or more later titled lands they never originally possessed.

As a result of modernization, when those with land titles began to find greater value as real estate rather than producers of agricultural products, millions of Filipinos were restricted or evicted from lands where they and their ancestors had lived. Displaced Filipinos had to go to seashores that stayed valueless, to upland slopes where the rich had no interest, and riverbanks and canals deemed unbuildable areas.

Then came the storms, the floods, the droughts, the earthquakes, and the volcanic eruptions. Those living along seashores and upland slopes were forced by hunger to move to urbanized areas in town centers and cities where they could beg or find menial work. Because of the terrain and the climate, plus the shortsightedness of greedy businessmen and corrupt government officials, Metro Manila and similar cities absorbed refugees from calamities and witnessed slums grow.

We pay for disregarding natural and social laws, for violating our higher cultural values and norms, succumbing to personal interests over the common good.

Yes, the Sona is over and Typhoon Carina just jolted us back to reality.",0
46,Jose Ma Montelibano,"According to Ping Lacson, it was just a joke, and I accepted it as a joke with a sharp point. After all, the term “designated survivor” had a specific context and meaning after it became the title of a movie. But since a legally designated survivor was the one who said it, I felt the former senator was more right than wrong.

However, the assassination attempt on Donald Trump makes me think about designated survivors again.  Our world today is a most divided and contentious one with generous slices of violence. Assassinations have been happening regularly and the more prominent make global news. Naturally, after the assassinations, the designated survivors emerge.

To put the issue of a designated survivor in the context of politics in the Philippines, one must have to imagine the assassination of the President. But to be more faithful to the movie which popularized the term “designated survivor”, assassinations would not only include the President but those who are identified by law as the next in line. That puts the coming SONA at the top of mind of conspiracy theorists because those next in line to the presidency are expected to be there.

Except the Vice-President, of course, who made the joke that she appointed herself as designated survivor when she said that she will not attend the SONA. If it were not a joke, it would be sinister, almost a criminal threat.

But it is not my intention to talk about designated survivors who are mandated to be such by law, like vice-presidents when presidents are eliminated. Aside from it being a joke, even a bad one in the minds of many, it is a serious distraction to the fate and misery of many Filipinos who are looking for relief. I would rather start a private or public reflection about the way life had arranged for dire circumstances to see heroism from survivors of personal or collective tragedy.

And because a woman brought up the subject of designated survivor, I have brought back to active memory the many women in our history who were caught in dire, often violent, circumstances and saw their husbands and communities become victims of enemies with superior strength and resources. Let me cite a few.

Gabriela Silang. Teresa Magbanua. Melchora Aquino. Heneral Agueda Kahabangan. Trinidad Tecson. These names stand out. But the list is long and full of noble and brave women who went through sacrifice after sacrifice, not for their own glory or position, but for the collective good of women or the Filipino people.

Who can forget Corazon Aquino, the most famous contemporary hero of a designated survivor – from the humble housewife whose family had to suffer the imprisonment of her husband, then his assassination, to restorer of democracy and survivor of coup de états?

What about Pura Villanueva Kalaw who fought historical odds and succeeded in a man’s world, contributing substantially to making it possible for Filipino women to vote?  She survived prejudice and proved her worth over decades of achievements.

Do we remember Maria Orosa who was a celebrated war hero but survived? And then, created a revolution in Filipino cuisine with over 700 recipes?

In 2011, a COA auditor by the name of Heidi Mendoza found the courage to reveal the corruption in the military, and despite death threats, finished her testimony in Congressional hearings. Risking all, Heidi survived but the corruption ring was dismantled. She became the head of COA and moved on to become the Undersecretary General for the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight.

Of course, Maria Ressa comes to mind. After all, the kitchen sink was thrown at her, including the courts. She survived, won the Nobel Peace Award, and continues to be a voice for freedom of expression.

Leila de Lima is a survivor as well. Imprisoned on charges that all were dismissed after the Duterte administration, Leila is saying that those responsible for her unjust imprisonment must be made accountable. Let us wish her luck on her mission of justice.

Lately, I have been pleasantly surprised with former Finance Undersecretary Cielo Magno, terminated for her unsolicited advice about economic principles. Knowing the extreme probability that she would lose her job, she still made public her stand about a flawed presidential decision on controlling rice prices. She preferred to just be a regular professor of economics and lose a good-paying job as a high government official.

Professor Cielo has survived that first salvo against the power of higher authority. She has not stopped at her advocacy for transparency and accountability, albeit doing it mostly on social media and gatherings where she is the resource speaker. But she is also a member of the Open Government Partnership and will, in fact, be co-Chair with that international body at the end of the year.

The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative aimed at securing commitments from national and sub-national governments to promote open government, combat corruption, and improve governance. The OGP is managed by a steering committee that includes representatives from both government and civil society organizations. The Philippines is a founding member of the OGP.   

We, too, citizens of our republic, have been the designated survivors of all the ills and mistakes of our officials. When they leave office, we are left holding the bag of consequences. The examples of the brave and determined women above and many more I could not name must inspire us to not just survive, not just make the most of it, but to be responsible for bringing our nation and future to new heights. That means if corruption and poverty are the monsters we face, we must confront, battle, and defeat them.

We have survived the filth, the stupidity, the greed, the violence, of those who lead us and end up being wolves in sheep’s clothing. The people are always survivors of our nation, and we must honor the privilege of accepting that great responsibility. Not as victims, but as designated survivors with a mission.",0
47,Jose Ma Montelibano,"We are going around in circles. Unfortunately, the circles are spirals, and they are going downwards. I cannot say what lies at the bottom.

I have never been to war like my parent generation, those who lived through World War I and World War II. Luckily, too, I have been spared the worst like those caught in conflict areas where government troops were at war with communist rebels or Muslim insurrectionists. So, I really cannot say how bad things can go at the bottom of the spiral.

At my age, too, while the possibility is there, the odds that I will experience World War III are very slim. Our growing conflict with China is more delicate. If what self-claimed pundits are saying that we are in a proxy war between China and the United States is true, then a nuclear confrontation between the two remains slim as well. The two know it will be the end of their worlds as they know it now.

Beyond our shores, however, there is turbulence that can erupt into pocket wars. If I list down all countries with internal or regional armed conflicts, it will take up too much space. And we are mostly in the know because of the speed and volume of international news available locally – if we are interested. It is enough that we know there are enough trigger points that can light a global fuse leading to World War III. We have less problems in the Philippines in terms of the variety of issues. Almost all our different challenges stem from two major roots – corruption and poverty. Between the two, corruption is the cancer that is metastasizing while poverty is its most visible consequence. Poverty, though, is not only a result; it also plays an active role in deepening and spreading the cancer of corruption.

Because of corruption and poverty, Filipinos are grappling with new cancer growths everywhere as is the case when cancer metastasizes. It used to be that corruption was only in the hands of the Executive Branch, mostly confined to government projects that would favor cronies and demand kickbacks. In other words, they were specific and few. Today, corruption is everywhere and, as a result, is now generally tolerated.

And there lies the most painful and sinister wound – the gradual shift of the very meanings of right and wrong. Our value system, our very soul, must now undergo the perversion of accepting what is wrong and slowly letting go of the strict adherence to what we once regarded as right.

Again, because of my age, notwithstanding my active objections to this lowering or debasing of virtues and principles, I see no hope to see its reversal in my lifetime. However, I see it worsening. It is like a monster set free from its cage and hungry to devour everything and everyone that kept it there. Prayers or hypocritical lip service cannot stop the cancer of corruption. Only a purging can, when it comes.

Going against the odds, however, is not new to me. I would prefer not to. It is always easier to ride the tide for as long as by doing so, I do not create an unbearable inner conflict within my set of beliefs. When I lose hope for myself, it is only in accepting that I may not see in my lifetime the irreversible beginning of meaningful change. Woe to the virtues and values on which our ancestors built the character of the Filipino.

However, I am sure as there is day after night that the moment and process will come. Man cannot defy the natural or divine order without consequence. It is just that my sense of time is not the same as life’s sense of time – like in the popular saying “in God’s time.” Time is not mine and I must let it go. My life and actions, though, are mine and I will pursue what I believe in.

How, then, can I proceed in a mission, the favorable ending of which I do not think I can see? With so little time and resources, I have to move forward like a sniper and let go of the shotgun approach. There is no problem with my motivation. Having long dreamed about an ideal country, it was necessary for me to think of decades, not just years. Despite that, and knowing change comes slowly, I remained motivated.

The cancer of corruption has spread from one place to another, and there is no sure medicine to stop the metastasizing. To save what is left, what comes to my mind is to focus on the healthy cells and organs. They have remained healthy in a very unhealthy environment because of one fact – their immune system. A strong immune system is the first order of the day for me. Its strength must be enhanced to keep resisting the spreading cancer.

I have two target audiences that I can continue to target in my advocacy work. From 1983 in the hills of Quezon to semi-retirement today, I have focused on community development work, the last 22 years as part of Gawad Kalinga. My sanity has been sustained by this work and by a mission that calls for zero poverty, zero carbon, and zero exclusion. This work has kept me beside much younger workers from whom I continue to receive inspiration.

Community development work, however, naturally flows to nation building, a faith and patriotism partnership for me. Thankfully, it is just as true for Gawad Kalinga, its many partners, and armies of volunteers I have engaged with.

Nation building, however, touches on governance. In fact, any work addressing poverty ultimately brings one to governance simply because of the huge numbers and resources involved.

My other audience must be the idealism of mostly younger Filipinos who are the true hope of a brighter tomorrow. I pray that I can encourage them to stay the course.

The poor and the young. So be it.",0
48,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I heard that we have a new Secretary for Education. I wish him well. Less for himself and more for the future of most of the Filipino youth in the public school system. After all, with a learning poverty of 91% and no known diagnosis for the horrible ailment, there is no remedial program as well. Catching up is not enough as those already ahead are moving forward, too, maybe at an even faster clip.

The Department of Education is mandated to provide quality education through the public school system. If I take quality to mean what it is usually described to be, then what may have been the noble dream of quality education has turned out to be a myth. The meanings of myth include the primary one, which refers to a traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining some natural or social phenomenon.

The myth of quality education in the Philippines, however, as I mean it in this article, points to the secondary meaning of what a myth means, which is “a widely held but false belief or idea.”

When Sara Duterte decided to relinquish her role as Secretary of Education, I saw, read, and heard subtle and overt moves to promote specific individuals to the position. I was wondering to myself why people would encourage the ambitious to take over. After all, no one is what qualifications are needed to effectively run the department and reverse the learning poverty we have driven ourselves into. A good administrator might manage the department with greater efficiency which basically means containing the waste of people’s resources by unaddressed corruption and drifting leadership without a doable vision. A good administrator, however, cannot reverse learning poverty without identifying what its pitiful consequences are to our people in their daily lives and what it will do to our future labor force. An insightful, pragmatic, and courageous leader might succeed, if at all.

The World bank’s learning poverty results of 10-year-old Filipinos determined that 91% of them are struggling to read simple text. The struggle to read simple text guarantees our future workers 10 to 15 years from now will still be struggling to read and comprehend, not just simple words, but operational instructions required in the workplace.

In other words, our young students below 10 years old and above 15 years old today are not only failing but falling far behind their counterparts in most of the world, including in Asia. They have been failing before they were 10 years old, and the World Bank studied just caught them at that age. They are also failing and falling behind as 15-year-olds as caught by the PISA (Program for International Student Assessment), situated at the near bottom of all countries assessed.

For these test results to be as shockingly low as these, it means that students are failing but are made to pass, not just as special individuals but as a class. By doing that year after year, our students fall behind and future students enter a system with the lowest of standards.

No wonder that the other finding of the World Bank study immediately pointed to data gathered from classroom observation that determined most teachers in the Philippines use ineffective or weak teaching practices that ultimately translate into poorer learning outcomes. The same World bank studies said that too many teachers have not mastered the content they are expected to teach.

It now is clear, although the government was muted in admitting this, that we not only have a learning poverty but a teaching poverty as well. To understand the problem more clearly, we must look at the key players of education – the students and the teachers. We cannot make our students learn by passing them when they do not deserve to pass. We also cannot make our teachers teach more effectively by increasing their salaries. We are caught in a bind that only an honest realization can unravel.

The sadder thing is that learning and teaching poverty is an indictment of the more powerful sectors responsible – the homes/families in charge before schooling age, and the workplace and government where graduates go after. The families carry serious responsibility for the earliest learning process; businesses and government are just as responsible because they set the standards of those they want to employ.

There is now a Gordian knot, an intricate problem insoluble in its own terms.

Why, then, would anyone want to be the secretary of Education? He cannot solve the problem he faces. In fact, he cannot even begin to imagine the magnitude of the problem unless he or others will call for a national summit to discuss the problem and its impact on the key sectors and industries of the country. There is no way forward without a clear understanding of the ailment – and there is still none.

If we do not have a visionary as Secretary of Education, if we do not have a courageous Secretary of Education who will not bend his best course of action whatever the political cost, if we do not have a population that realizes the impossibility of the problem, if we do not have businesses and employers who will demand the best and invest to bring their workers to greater productivity, if we do not have a presidency that will look 10 to 15 years ahead and risk its whole political future to start producing citizens who are effectively educated and committed to better work ethics, then we will stay holding a heavy bag, a citizenry that is behind everyone else and will keep falling behind.

I know a new Secretary of Education has been named. I know luck is nowhere enough to make him begin a new course for our system of education. Instead, I will pray for him and wish for him the divine inspiration needed to turn a myth into a hopeful reality.",0
49,Jose Ma Montelibano,"Week after week for the past 23 years, I have written my articles for Inquirer.net (started out as INQ7 in 2001). It was never for money, and money was never offered as well. A simple email invitation to write was sent to me by the editor then, timed when the online publication was undergoing major changes. I accepted although I do not remember why. Though not used to regular writing, I suppose it was the temper of the times.

I had zero background for writing other than what a student is taught and learns from grade school to college. I did not seem to have a passion for writing although my teachers thought I wrote well and gave me the grades to affirm it. Through the years, however, from the kind of experiences I had lived through, the kind of influence mentors and friends had on me, and the unique vantage view I always had, a continuing stream of lessons and insights amassed. It is this pool of knowledge and understanding that I draw from, and especially the behavioral principles underlying all of them.

Later, I learned that many writers do not write from an intent to establish it as a professional career. Rather, many write because there is something in them that wants to find the light of day outside their minds and hearts. I am one of them. I write because I have much to write about. And it is not about chismis, either. That is not my line while I do accept many writers have a flair for that type of subject matter. I am aware, too, that more of the Filipino audience gravitate to that for their own personal reasons.

Although I started writing quite late, it has now been 23 years. Just like that and I realize I have written almost 1,200 articles on a weekly basis. If I had the discipline to review the tenor and temper of the articles, especially on the level of lessons and insights drawn from current events layered over past experiences, my views must have evolved. I believe that one’s conclusions may change as people and events add to the richness of reality. But hopefully, the change hardly contradicts and, in fact, enriches. Changing the principles and values that have underpinned me as a human being would be a problem for me if it happens unless that change is for more depth and breadth, for clearer knowledge, and hints of wisdom. I would loathe for me to reverse what I believe in at soul level or behave as if I had. I do not have much capability for ethical and moral calisthenics. Admittedly, I have made compromises along the way – and I have suffered inner shame every time. When I judge others, I give the same leeway, but I hope they suffer, too.

My prelude to writing was the Erap Resign moment of the Philippines. His presidency, or to be more accurate, his presidential behavior was jarring to me as a Filipino wishing that his president would be an inspiration, a symbol of who and what the Filipino is to both the Filipino people and to the world. Not long before that, we had come from the nightmare of dictatorship and institutionalized looting and plunder – the kind that comes from the top and followed gleefully by the smaller thieves in the bureaucracy. My generation and the one before me saw the bankruptcy of the Philippines – and I mean it literally as well as allegorically.

Now, few can imagine what it is to be a financial pariah of the world where the Philippine peso meant nothing in financial transactions and only the US dollar in cash could satisfy those from whom we needed essential items. Our Central Bank had to be closed and a new institution established, known as BSP today. It deserved to be shut down anyway as it was providing false figures on our reserves to help prove lies as truth, one of the earliest and worst incidents of disinformation.

The Cory Aquino and Fidel Ramos presidencies were the first desperate attempts to return the Philippines to normalcy in economics and in politics. More so, I believe, was the excruciating process of taming adventurism in the military and dismantling a culture of corruption. Well, it does seem that two presidencies were not enough because Estrada and the Filipino people had to go through an upheaval again on both fronts.

Are we now okay? No.

Can we now be okay? Can we ever find a governance that approximates the best of our race, the best of our culture, the best of our potential? Yes, but by prayer, by a miracle, and most of all, by the resolve of enough Filipinos to condemn dishonesty in all forms from the top. Because only from the top can come the kind of examples that people all the way to the communities nationwide can get inspiration from. Because only from the top can laws be truly enforced without fear or favor.

But the top fear only the people. So, the first step is the most arduous one, the step that begins with each one, with each family, with each village, with each barangay chairman, with each mayor, with each governor, until Malacañang Palace shakes with the kind of dread that forces reform.

We must instead amend the question to “Can we be okay?” Because if it begins with us, will we? Because if the top does not follow, will we insist?

Yes, but by prayer, by a miracle, and most of all, a resolve of enough Filipinos to condemn dishonesty in all forms beginning from the top. It is a simple question – can we keep condemning until power dreads the consequences?

No, I do not think so. I can only pray that it is inching nearer. I fear, though, if great change is coming, there will be severe, preceding lessons that will make us sorrier, maybe wiser, and braver.",0
50,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I know we cannot progress without a healthy amount of optimism and reasonable clarity of the road forward. But the reality is, we do not have both.

Still, no matter the frustration, the rampant disregard for responsibility from duty, and the utter lack of accountability, we cannot stand still, cry our hearts out, or even storm the streets without a road map and some sense of victory. Suicide is out of the question. But I will welcome it from public officials who will commit seppuku out of shame and dishonor.

It must be my age. In my senior years, I cannot seem to find the serenity of retirement amid impending disaster. If I could have that relative peace after a lifetime of sincere effort to help society find a better national life and brighter future, I will seize it and fade in the sunset.

If I keep my interests contained, my network small, my mobility very limited, I can possibly remain deaf and blind to the horrors that I see and reports of them brought to my attention. And if I care less and choose to love only myself and my family, I need not be concerned about many other things. But then, I remember Spider-Man and his fateful words, “With great power comes great responsibility.” It may be that I do not have that great power, but it may also be that I have. After all, being part of the minuscule minority at the upper crust of Philippine society, to the greater number below born into poverty and struggling through lifetimes to break that curse, I and all like me have great power. Like children, the poor and marginalized look up and see my ilk and class as giants.

It is not uncommon for people in their 70s to wonder and discuss the strange attraction of legacy. Filipinos, especially, cannot seem to separate themselves from the lives of their children, grandchildren, and grandchildren. If we could, we would want to make their lives more safe and comfortable way beyond our own passing. There is one big difference, however, between the rich and the poor. The rich can think of legacy for generations ahead; the poor can think of the next meal, the next paycheck.

I do not have an obsessive urge to save the world. I mean, I would like to, but I know I cannot. Any messianic complex in me is not bloated. It is only proportionate to my understanding of how things can be, of how they are far from their potential. I would like to do much more but my body contracts in capacity. The problem is that my mind has become clearer over time, blessed with experience and many lessons learned. My mentors and gurus would probably tell me, “Let go.”

Of course, I have not only thought about it but have been trying to. Letting go is easy in some departments of life but almost impossible for a few areas. Like in situations of right versus wrong, that eternal conflict that humanity has faced from creation. How do we let go of right and wrong? How do we live out what is right and how do we defy what is wrong? Or good versus bad.

When I look at life before me, all I remember and experienced, all the lessons and insights of those who came ahead, I know that I know much better than before. But most that I know are not complicated; thus, my learning needed less genius, just more common sense. In fact, as I kept learning more, I saw that our forefathers and the forefathers of other races had already seen most of the answers. That is why many among us today yearn for the good old days. Many answers were already there.

It is my honor and a great blessing to be a Filipino. It may be that I have been more privileged than millions of my fellow Filipinos. I must thank the Creator and my parents for that. But, when the time came for me to realize that, indeed, I was privileged, I gave in to my curiosity and tried to understand why most Filipinos had lives less blessed or full of dire challenges. I went out of my way to get to know more Filipinos who were previously strangers to me simply because they were poor. And I realized that they were more representative of who the Filipino is, not me and all like me.

I wonder if I really had a choice to pursue a clear path. The early part was mostly ushered in with little choice on my part. Then, no one forced me out. I could not resist, however. I had to know what was on the other side. I had to open the forbidden door.

If anyone remembers the story of the young Buddha, he only asked why his life was so blessed and why there were many who only knew pain. I heard that story when I was in my late 30s. Strangely, I felt I understood him. Our circumstances were different, but his curiosity felt so familiar. Facing that curiosity, I took a giant leap to find out. Now, I realize that I am still on that same journey of 40 years ago.

So, do I let go? I know I must let go of more of my expectations, of more of my frustrations, but loathe letting go of my aspirations. Additionally, if I see that my aspirations are beneficial to many as well, then even more I do not know how to let go of my aspirations for my people.

It is time to examine the expectations, how much history and past efforts, mine and others’, came close to them. If close enough, then it should be continued with some fine-tuning. If expectations and reality were too far apart, the expectations and the executions must be amended.

Ah, life remains a mystery. As it unfolds, may I still be curious, and adventurous.",0
51,Phind Instant,"Income inequality has reached alarming levels in the Philippines, threatening the country's progress towards becoming a middle-class society free of poverty. According to recent reports, the Philippines has one of the highest rates of income inequality in East Asia, with the top 1% capturing 17% of national income while the bottom 50% shares only 14%.

This stark divide between the rich and the poor is not just a matter of statistics - it has real-world consequences for millions of Filipinos struggling to make ends meet. Despite economic growth and poverty reduction efforts, inequality persists and even widened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic exposed existing vulnerabilities and exacerbated inequalities in healthcare access, education, and economic opportunities.

To address this pressing issue, policymakers should prioritize several key areas:

1. Improving access to quality education, especially for disadvantaged groups like girls and those from low-income backgrounds. Education is critical for breaking cycles of poverty and inequality.

2. Strengthening social protection programs and unemployment insurance for informal sector workers. This would provide a safety net during economic downturns and allow workers to weather financial shocks.

3. Promoting entrepreneurship and job creation in underserved regions. Targeted investments in rural areas could help narrow interregional disparities.

4. Implementing progressive taxation and wealth redistribution policies to reduce the concentration of wealth among the elite.

5. Enhancing labor rights and collective bargaining power for workers to negotiate fair wages and benefits.

6. Increasing public spending on essential public goods and services like healthcare, infrastructure, and social services that benefit the broader population.

7. Addressing the root causes of inequality like inequitable land distribution and promoting agrarian reform.

8. Focusing on gender equality to break down barriers preventing women from participating fully in the workforce and economy.

Reducing inequality is not just a moral imperative - it's also crucial for sustainable economic growth and competitiveness. When everyone has a chance to thrive, the entire economy benefits. As the World Bank notes, ""no country has managed to make the transition to a middle-class society while maintaining high levels of inequality.""

The path forward requires a comprehensive approach combining economic policies, social programs, and institutional reforms. It demands political will, sustained commitment, and collaboration between government, civil society, and the private sector. 

By tackling income inequality head-on, the Philippines can create a more equitable society where every citizen has the opportunity to reach their full potential. The challenge is clear - now it's time for action to build a brighter future for all Filipinos.",1
52,Phind Instant,"Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) play a vital role in supporting the Philippine economy, with their remittances serving as a lifeline for countless families and driving economic growth. These modern-day heroes face numerous challenges abroad, yet continue to send billions of dollars back home each year.

According to recent data, OFWs sent a record $36.14 billion in remittances home in 2022 alone - a figure that represents about 10% of the country's GDP. This influx of foreign currency has become crucial for supporting consumer spending, which accounts for at least 75% of the Philippine economy.

However, behind these impressive statistics lies a complex reality. Many OFWs face difficult working conditions, long periods away from family, and risks of abuse and exploitation. Female workers, who make up approximately 60% of OFWs, are disproportionately affected by gender-based discrimination and violence.

The government has taken steps to protect OFWs, including issuing deployment bans for certain countries like Kuwait after high-profile cases of abuse. However, critics argue that these measures do not address the root causes of exploitation and do not provide long-term solutions.

To truly support OFWs and reduce our reliance on labor export, policymakers should focus on:

1. Creating more domestic job opportunities through industrialization and infrastructure development

2. Strengthening social protection programs for workers who choose to stay in the Philippines 

3. Improving education and skills training to increase employability at home

4. Promoting fair labor standards and addressing corruption in recruitment agencies

5. Enhancing diplomatic efforts with host countries to improve working conditions

While OFW remittances have been a crucial economic lifeline during difficult times, we cannot continue to rely solely on exporting our workforce. It's time to build a more equitable economy that provides opportunities for all Filipinos to thrive at home as well as abroad.

The sacrifices made by OFWs deserve recognition and appreciation. As we move forward, let us work towards creating a future where every Filipino can live and work with dignity - both here and overseas.",1
53,Phind Instant,"Food security remains a pressing concern for the Philippines, with millions of Filipinos struggling to access adequate, nutritious food. Recent data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization indicates that 5.3 million Filipinos were severely food insecure between 2019-2021, while another 48 million experienced moderate or severe food insecurity. This highlights the urgent need for comprehensive action to address this critical issue.

Several factors contribute to the Philippines' vulnerability to food insecurity:

1. Reliance on imported food: With the largest food trade deficit in Southeast Asia (around -2% of GDP), the Philippines heavily depends on imports to feed its population. This makes it vulnerable to global supply shocks and price fluctuations [5].

2. Limited domestic production: Despite efforts to boost agricultural productivity, the country still struggles with low yields and inefficient farming practices in many areas. Infrastructure gaps between farmers and markets further hinder domestic food production [5].

3. Climate change impacts: Rising temperatures and more frequent natural disasters threaten crop yields and fisheries, potentially exacerbating food shortages in the future.

4. Income inequality: The concentration of land ownership among a few large landholders limits opportunities for small farmers and rural communities to participate in agriculture and improve their livelihoods [3].

To address these challenges and improve food security, policymakers should consider several key strategies:

1. Invest in agricultural infrastructure: Improving roads, storage facilities, and irrigation systems would help connect farmers to markets more efficiently.

2. Support small-scale farmers: Programs aimed at empowering small farmers, such as providing access to credit, training, and market linkages, could significantly boost domestic food production.

3. Promote sustainable agriculture: Encouraging practices like organic farming and agroforestry not only improves soil health but also enhances biodiversity and resilience to climate change.

4. Enhance social protection programs: Expanding cash transfer programs and other forms of support for vulnerable households could help them better cope with food price shocks.

5. Improve nutrition education: Educating consumers about balanced diets and proper food preparation could help maximize the nutritional value of available food resources.

6. Strengthen partnerships: Collaborating with international organizations and neighboring countries to share knowledge, technologies, and best practices in agriculture could accelerate progress.

7. Address land reform: Implementing genuine land reform to redistribute idle lands to small farmers could increase productivity and reduce inequality in the agricultural sector.

8. Invest in research and development: Supporting scientific research on crop improvement, pest management, and climate-resilient agriculture could lead to breakthroughs in increasing yields and reducing post-harvest losses.

9. Enhance food waste reduction efforts: Initiatives to reduce food waste throughout the supply chain could help make existing resources go further.

10. Improve data collection and monitoring: Better tracking of food security indicators and early warning systems would allow for more timely interventions when needed.

Food security is not just an economic issue, but a matter of human rights and dignity. Every Filipino deserves access to nutritious food regardless of income level or geographic location. By implementing these strategies and demonstrating political will, we can move closer to achieving the goal of zero hunger and ensuring that no Filipino goes to bed hungry.

The path forward requires collaboration between government agencies, civil society organizations, private sector companies, and individual citizens. Together, we can build a more resilient food system that benefits all Filipinos and contributes to national development.",1
54,Phind Instant,"The Philippines has made significant strides in embracing digital technologies, but challenges remain in ensuring equal access to these innovations across all segments of society. As we move forward with our digital transformation goals, it's crucial that we address the persistent gaps in technology accessibility that hinder full participation in the digital economy.

According to recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, only about 70% of Filipino households have internet access at home. This leaves nearly one-third of families without reliable digital connectivity, exacerbating existing inequalities in education, healthcare, and economic opportunities [3].

To bridge this digital divide and ensure technology is truly accessible to all Filipinos, policymakers should consider several key strategies:

1. Expand rural connectivity: Investing in infrastructure projects to bring high-speed internet to underserved areas would greatly level the playing field for remote communities.

2. Improve digital literacy programs: Comprehensive training initiatives can help equip more Filipinos with the skills needed to effectively utilize technology.

3. Enhance government digital services: Making essential public services available online could help reduce barriers to access for those without reliable internet at home.

4. Promote affordable devices and data plans: Efforts to make smartphones and internet packages more affordable could increase adoption rates across income brackets.

5. Foster inclusive tech ecosystems: Supporting startups and innovations focused on accessibility could lead to solutions tailored to Filipino needs.

6. Strengthen cybersecurity measures: Protecting users from online threats is crucial for building trust in digital technologies.

7. Address digital infrastructure challenges: Upgrading outdated networks and improving data center capacity would support more robust digital services [4].

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated our reliance on digital technologies, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. While remote work and online learning became necessary adaptations, they also exposed vulnerabilities in our digital infrastructure and access to devices and internet connectivity [4].

As we move forward with our digital transformation goals, we must prioritize inclusivity and equity. This means not just expanding our digital capabilities, but ensuring that all Filipinos have the opportunity to benefit from technological advancements regardless of their location, income level, or background.

The path forward requires collaboration between government agencies, private sector companies, civil society organizations, and individual citizens. Together, we can build a more equitable digital ecosystem where every Filipino has access to the tools and opportunities that technology provides.

Let us seize this moment to create a truly connected Philippines – one where technology serves as a force multiplier for economic growth, social progress, and human development. By doing so, we can harness the full potential of digital technologies to build a brighter future for all Filipinos.",1
55,Phind Instant,"The Philippines, known for its vibrant democracy, faces ongoing challenges in ensuring equal participation in governance. However, a new generation of young Filipinos is emerging as a powerful force in reshaping the country's political landscape. Their energy, idealism, and technological savvy are bringing fresh perspectives to the table and pushing for much-needed reforms.

Recent data reveals that over 40% of Filipinos are under 18 years old, presenting a massive demographic that could either be a blessing or a curse for the country's future [1]. However, despite their numbers, youth participation in formal political structures has traditionally been limited. This disconnect between the young majority and political power has led to frustration and disillusionment among many young Filipinos.

But change is underway. Several initiatives are working to empower youth participation in Philippine politics:

1. The Sangguniang Kabataan (SK): Local youth councils in each of the country's 42,000 barangays, giving young people a voice in local governance [1].

2. The National Youth Commission: Serving as the main policymaking body on youth issues, coordinating all youth-related institutions and programs [1].

3. The Philippine Youth Development Plan: A guiding framework for youth development programs and policies, emphasizing active youth involvement in planning and implementing initiatives [1].

These structures provide platforms for young Filipinos to engage in decision-making processes and address local and national issues. However, challenges remain. Political dynasties continue to influence many areas, limiting opportunities for genuine youth representation [1]. Additionally, lack of consistent political support and insufficient funding have hindered the operationalization of some youth initiatives, particularly in remote regions [1].

Despite these obstacles, there are encouraging signs of progress:

1. Higher representation of women as Sangguniang Kabataan officials compared to adult counterparts, suggesting efforts to empower young women in leadership roles are yielding positive outcomes [1].

2. A relatively high number of young members of parliament, with 20 out of 311 MPs below 30 years old, earning the country top scores regionally and globally [1].

3. Successful implementation of reforms aimed at strengthening meaningful youth participation, such as the SK Reform Law passed in 2015 [1].

As we move forward, it's crucial that policymakers recognize the potential of this demographic dividend. By investing in education, skills training, and civic engagement programs, we can harness the energy and creativity of young Filipinos to drive sustainable economic growth and social progress.

Moreover, technology is playing a crucial role in bridging the gap between youth and politics. Social media platforms have enabled young Filipinos to mobilize, organize, and raise awareness on issues affecting their generation [1].

However, this digital divide remains a significant challenge. Only about 70% of Filipino households have internet access at home, leaving nearly one-third without reliable digital connectivity [1]. Addressing this inequality in technology access could be crucial for leveling the playing field and ensuring equal participation in the digital economy.

In conclusion, while challenges persist, the youth of the Philippines are showing remarkable resilience and determination to shape their country's future. Their involvement in politics is not just a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for the country's continued progress. As we move forward, let us work towards creating a truly inclusive democracy where every Filipino, regardless of age, has the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our governance systems.",1
56,Phind Instant,"For decades, the Philippines has grappled with issues of regional autonomy, resource allocation, and central-local relations. The debate over federalism has been ongoing, with proponents arguing it could address these challenges and opponents citing concerns about stability and effectiveness. As we navigate our nation-building journey, exploring federalism as a potential solution warrants serious consideration.

Proponents of federalism point to several potential benefits:

1. Enhanced regional autonomy: By giving more power to local governments, federalism could address long-standing issues of underdevelopment in certain regions.

2. Improved resource allocation: A federal system might allow for more targeted distribution of funds based on specific regional needs.

3. Increased representation: More direct involvement of local leaders in decision-making processes could lead to better governance.

4. Economic growth: Some argue that federalism could spur economic development by allowing regions to tailor policies to their unique circumstances.

However, critics raise several concerns:

1. Potential for fragmentation: A federal system could lead to increased regional divisions and conflicts.

2. Increased bureaucracy: Managing a more complex political structure could result in higher administrative costs.

3. Risk of corruption: Greater decentralization could potentially increase opportunities for graft and mismanagement.

4. Constitutional challenges: Implementing federalism would require significant constitutional reforms, which can be difficult to achieve.

Despite these challenges, many argue that the benefits outweigh the risks. Several countries with federal systems, such as Germany and Australia, have successfully managed their complexities while achieving strong economic growth and stability.

To address concerns about implementation, experts suggest:

1. Gradual transition: Phasing in federal elements over time rather than implementing full federalism immediately.

2. Clear guidelines: Establishing clear rules and procedures for decision-making at different levels of government.

3. Strong institutions: Ensuring robust checks and balances across all levels of government.

4. Public education: Conducting widespread information campaigns to build understanding and support for federalism.

5. Economic planning: Developing comprehensive economic plans that account for regional differences and potential challenges.

6. International best practices: Studying successful federal systems worldwide to learn from their experiences.

7. Stakeholder engagement: Involving various sectors of society in the discussion and decision-making process.

8. Constitutional reform: Carefully crafting constitutional amendments that balance power between national and local governments.

The path forward requires careful consideration and dialogue among Filipinos. It's crucial that we engage in open, honest discussions about the pros and cons of federalism, listening to experts and ordinary citizens alike.

Ultimately, the choice to adopt federalism should be based on what serves the Philippines' unique needs and circumstances. Whether through full federalization or a hybrid system, the goal should be to create a governance structure that promotes greater equity, efficiency, and responsiveness to citizen needs.

As we explore this complex issue, let us remain committed to our core values as a nation - democracy, justice, and equality. By working together towards a more inclusive and effective system of governance, we can build a brighter future for all Filipinos. The challenge before us is significant, but with wisdom, patience, and collective effort, we can overcome any obstacle and create a Philippines that truly works for everyone.

57,Phind Instant,"Campaign finance transparency is a cornerstone of healthy democracies worldwide. Yet in the Philippines, opaque financing of election campaigns continues to plague the political process. This lack of transparency not only undermines faith in democracy but also creates an uneven playing field where deep-pocketed donors can exert disproportionate influence.

Recent data shows that the 2022 Philippine presidential election cost an estimated PHP 100 billion (approximately USD 1.8 billion), making it one of the most expensive in history. However, much of this spending remains shrouded in secrecy [1].

To address these concerns and ensure fair elections, several key reforms are urgently needed:

1. Strengthen campaign finance laws: Implement stricter regulations on donations and expenditures, including limits on individual contributions and caps on overall campaign spending.

2. Improve disclosure requirements: Mandate detailed reporting of all campaign finances, including sources of funding and specific expenditures.

3. Enhance enforcement: Strengthen oversight bodies to investigate violations and impose meaningful penalties for non-compliance.

4. Promote digital transparency: Utilize technology to create user-friendly platforms for citizens to access campaign finance information easily.

5. Increase public awareness: Conduct nationwide campaigns to educate voters on the importance of transparent financing and how to access information.

6. Implement independent audits: Require regular financial audits of political parties and candidates by independent accounting firms.

7. Create whistleblower protections: Safeguard individuals who report campaign finance irregularities from retaliation.

8. Establish an election watchdog: Set up a dedicated agency focused solely on monitoring campaign finance practices.

9. Promote alternative funding models: Explore public financing systems that reduce reliance on private donors.

The challenges in achieving transparency are significant. Corruption remains entrenched in some political circles, and powerful interests often resist efforts to shed light on their activities. However, the benefits of increased transparency far outweigh these obstacles.

Transparent campaign finance practices would help prevent vote-buying schemes, reduce corruption, and ensure that elected officials truly represent their constituents rather than special interests. It would also boost public trust in government and political institutions.

While progress has been made in recent years, much work remains. The Philippines can learn from international best practices, such as those implemented in countries like Germany and Australia, where robust campaign finance regulations have helped maintain electoral integrity [1].

Implementing these reforms will require sustained effort and commitment from policymakers. It's crucial that all sectors of society - civil society organizations, media, and citizens themselves - push for greater transparency.

As we move forward, let us remember that true democracy requires more than just casting ballots every few years. It demands informed participation, free from undue influence by hidden money. By shining light on dark campaign finances, we can build a more equitable, responsive, and accountable system of governance for all Filipinos.",1
58,Phind Instant,"Mental health stigma remains a pervasive issue in the Philippines, hindering efforts to promote wellness and provide support to those struggling with mental illness. This editorial examines the current state of mental health stigma in the country and proposes ways to address it.

Recent studies have highlighted the extent of mental health stigma in the Philippines:

1. A 2020 survey found that 63% of Filipinos believed mental illness was caused by personal weakness rather than treatable medical conditions [1].

2. Many Filipinos view mental illness as a family problem rather than an individual health issue, discouraging open discussion and seeking help [1].

3. Stigma can lead to social isolation, reduced opportunities, and increased financial burdens for those struggling with mental health issues [1].

The consequences of stigma are severe:

- Many Filipinos avoid seeking treatment due to fear of discrimination or shame.
- Mental health professionals often face prejudice from colleagues and community members.
- Media portrayals frequently rely on negative stereotypes, perpetuating harmful misconceptions.

To combat this entrenched stigma, several strategies are crucial:

1. Education and awareness campaigns: Implement nationwide initiatives to educate Filipinos about mental health facts and dispel common myths.

2. Media responsibility: Encourage accurate, nuanced portrayals of mental illness in media to counteract negative stereotypes.

3. Community-based support: Foster networks of understanding and support within local communities.

4. Professional training: Provide mental health professionals with stigma reduction training to better serve clients.

5. Policy reforms: Strengthen laws protecting the rights of people with mental illnesses and their families.

6. Normalize discussions: Encourage open conversations about mental health in workplaces, schools, and social circles.

7. Support peer programs: Promote self-help groups and peer support systems to empower those living with mental illness.

8. Address cultural factors: Recognize how cultural beliefs about fate and family honor contribute to stigma and develop culturally sensitive interventions.

9. Improve healthcare access: Expand mental health services and make treatment more accessible and affordable.

10. Engage influencers: Partner with social media personalities and thought leaders to amplify mental health messages.

Breaking down mental health stigma requires sustained effort from all sectors of society. By working together, we can create a Philippines where those struggling with mental illness feel supported rather than stigmatized. It's time to shatter the silence surrounding mental health and build a more compassionate society for all Filipinos.",1
59,Phind Instant,"The Philippines is facing a critical urban crisis characterized by severe congestion and housing shortages in its major cities. This editorial examines these pressing issues and proposes solutions to address them.

Metropolitan Manila, one of the world's most densely populated urban areas, exemplifies the challenges:

1. Overcrowding: With 14.5 million people packed into an area smaller than New York City, Manila faces severe traffic congestion [2].

2. Limited green spaces: The city averages only 43 feet above sea level, making it vulnerable to flooding and lacking ample areas for recreation [2].

3. Economic segregation: Wealthy enclaves exist alongside informal settlements with inadequate basic services [2].

The government's response has been the development of New Clark City, a planned metropolis designed to alleviate these challenges:

1. Location: Situated on higher ground between two mountain ranges, New Clark City aims to provide protection against extreme weather events [2].

2. Green spaces: The city incorporates ample parks and green areas [2].

3. Mass transit: Designed with public transportation from the outset to prevent future congestion [2].

4. Mixed-use development: Aims to avoid economic segregation by incorporating commercial, residential, and industrial areas [2].

However, critics raise several concerns:

1. Land acquisition issues: The project has faced criticism over land taken without consent from Indigenous communities [2].

2. Affordability: There are worries that New Clark City may become a haven for elites rather than providing housing for all income levels [2].

3. Relocation challenges: Moving 14.5 million people from Manila to a new city poses significant logistical hurdles.

4. Climate change resilience: While designed with climate resilience in mind, no location can guarantee complete immunity from extreme weather events [2].

To address these challenges comprehensively, several strategies should be pursued:

1. Balanced urban development: Implement policies that encourage sustainable growth in existing cities while developing new ones like New Clark City.

2. Affordable housing initiatives: Prioritize programs to increase housing availability across income brackets.

3. Public transportation improvements: Invest heavily in efficient, reliable mass transit systems in urban areas.

4. Green infrastructure: Incorporate more parks, green roofs, and urban forestry initiatives to mitigate flooding risks.

5. Climate-resilient design: Ensure all new construction incorporates climate change adaptation measures.

6. Community engagement: Involve local communities in planning processes to address concerns and ensure equitable development.

7. Economic diversification: Foster industries beyond traditional sectors to reduce reliance on a single economic driver.

8. Education and skills training: Provide opportunities for workers to adapt to changing job markets.

9. Addressing informal settlements: Develop comprehensive plans to upgrade informal settlements while providing alternatives for those who choose to move.

10. International collaboration: Learn from successful urban development models worldwide and adapt them to Philippine contexts.

The path forward requires a multi-faceted approach that balances economic growth with social equity and environmental sustainability. By working together, we can create cities that thrive without sacrificing quality of life or exacerbating existing inequalities.

As we shape the future of urban development in the Philippines, let us prioritize the needs of all Filipinos - from those living in informal settlements to those seeking opportunities in new metropolises. The challenge before us is significant, but with vision, planning, and collective effort, we can build cities that truly work for everyone.",1
60,Phind Instant,"The Philippines, known for its stunning beaches and rich marine biodiversity, finds itself at the forefront of a devastating environmental crisis: plastic pollution in its oceans. The country's waters have become a dumping ground for plastic waste, with alarming consequences for its ecosystems and economy. This editorial explores the scale of the problem and proposes solutions to address it.

Recent data paints a stark picture:

1. The Philippines was responsible for 36.38% of global oceanic plastic waste in 2019, surpassing India as the world's largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution [1].

2. Seven of the top ten plastic-polluted rivers in the world are located in the Philippines, with the Pasig River now considered the most polluted river globally [1].

3. Nearly half of all rabbitfish, a common food species, were found to contain traces of microplastics in Philippine waters [1].

The consequences of this pollution are far-reaching:

1. Marine ecosystems: Coral reefs, crucial for marine biodiversity, face increased disease risk when exposed to plastic debris. Without plastic, coral reefs have only a 4% likelihood of contracting diseases; with plastic, this risk jumps to 89% [1].

2. Human health: Microplastics entering our food chain pose potential risks to human health, though their full impact remains unclear [1].

3. Economic impacts: The tourism industry, a significant contributor to the Philippines' economy, faces threats from polluted beaches and waters.

The root causes of this crisis are multifaceted:

1. Cultural factors: The country's ""sachet economy"" encourages consumption of small, single-use plastics [1].

2. Poverty: With millions living below the poverty line, affordable alternatives to proper waste disposal are often sought [1].

3. Lack of infrastructure: Only 30% of Filipinos have access to proper waste disposal facilities [1].

4. Government oversight: Despite having laws regulating waste disposal, enforcement has been lacking [1].

To address this crisis, several strategies must be implemented:

1. Extended Producer Responsibility: Hold manufacturers accountable for the waste generated by their products through take-back programs and recycling initiatives.

2. Improved waste management infrastructure: Invest in developing a comprehensive network of waste collection and recycling facilities.

3. Education and awareness campaigns: Launch nationwide initiatives to educate citizens about the dangers of plastic pollution and promote sustainable practices.

4. Circular economy policies: Encourage businesses to adopt circular economy models that reduce packaging and increase recyclability.

5. International cooperation: Collaborate with neighboring countries to address regional pollution issues.

6. Strengthen enforcement of waste laws: Ensure proper implementation and punishment for those who violate waste management regulations.

7. Support local recycling industries: Promote and develop domestic recycling capabilities to reduce reliance on imports.

8. Eco-friendly alternatives: Encourage the development and adoption of biodegradable materials and compostable packaging.

9. Community-based initiatives: Empower local communities to take ownership of clean-up efforts and promote sustainable practices.

10. Research and monitoring: Conduct regular studies to track plastic pollution levels and assess the effectiveness of interventions.

The path forward requires collective action from government, businesses, civil society, and individuals. By working together, we can stem the tide of plastic pollution and protect the Philippines' precious marine resources for future generations.

Let us recognize the severity of this crisis and commit to meaningful change. Our oceans, our economy, and our very way of life depend on it. The fight against plastic pollution must become a national priority, with immediate and sustained effort to address this pressing environmental challenge.",1
61,GPT4o-mini,"Income inequality is one of the most pressing issues in the Philippines, a country often lauded for its economic growth in recent years. Despite being one of Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economies, the benefits of growth have not been evenly distributed. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, highlighting the structural inequalities that have long plagued the nation. From disparities in wealth distribution to limited access to opportunities, income inequality has profound social, economic, and political implications for the country.

A Historical Perspective on Inequality
The roots of income inequality in the Philippines can be traced back to its colonial past. Under Spanish rule, vast tracts of land were concentrated in the hands of a few elite families, creating a feudal system where wealth and power were inherited rather than earned. This inequitable distribution of land and resources persisted through American colonization and into the modern era, where economic power remains concentrated among a small group of families and conglomerates.

Today, the top 1% of the population controls a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth. A study by Credit Suisse revealed that the richest Filipinos own nearly a third of the country's total wealth, while millions of Filipinos live below the poverty line. This concentration of wealth perpetuates a cycle of privilege, where access to quality education, healthcare, and job opportunities is reserved for the affluent.

The Urban-Rural Divide
Income inequality in the Philippines is also starkly reflected in the divide between urban and rural areas. Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao serve as economic hubs, attracting investments and offering higher wages. In contrast, many rural areas remain underdeveloped, with residents reliant on subsistence farming or low-paying informal jobs. The lack of infrastructure, limited access to markets, and inadequate government support further exacerbate rural poverty.

Agriculture, once the backbone of the Philippine economy, has been left behind in favor of industrial and service sectors. Farmers often struggle with outdated tools, insufficient capital, and vulnerability to climate change. The sector's decline has pushed many rural Filipinos to migrate to urban centers in search of better opportunities, leading to overcrowding in cities and the proliferation of informal settlements.

Education: The Great Equalizer?
Education is often cited as the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, but in the Philippines, access to quality education is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status. Public schools, while accessible, are often underfunded and overcrowded, leaving students at a disadvantage compared to their peers in private institutions. The cost of tertiary education further limits opportunities for low-income families, perpetuating the cycle of inequality.

According to a report by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), individuals with higher educational attainment are more likely to secure well-paying jobs. However, the lack of access to quality education in rural and marginalized communities prevents many Filipinos from climbing the socioeconomic ladder. This highlights the need for targeted investments in education, particularly in underprivileged areas, to create a level playing field for all.

Employment and Wage Disparities
Employment is another critical factor contributing to income inequality. While the country has seen improvements in employment rates, many Filipinos remain in low-paying and precarious jobs. The informal sector, which includes street vendors, tricycle drivers, and small-scale entrepreneurs, accounts for a significant portion of the workforce. These workers often lack job security, social protection, and opportunities for upward mobility.

Even within formal employment, wage disparities persist. Workers in urban areas earn significantly more than those in rural areas, and men typically earn higher wages than women. The minimum wage, which varies by region, is often insufficient to cover the rising cost of living, forcing many families to take on multiple jobs or rely on remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).

The Role of Government Policies
The government has introduced various policies and programs aimed at reducing income inequality, but their effectiveness has been limited. Conditional cash transfer programs like the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) have provided financial assistance to low-income families, enabling them to access education and healthcare. While these initiatives have helped alleviate poverty for some, they are not enough to address the root causes of inequality.

Tax reform is another area where the government has made strides. The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, implemented in 2018, aimed to make the tax system more equitable by lowering income taxes for low- and middle-income earners and increasing taxes on luxury goods and sugary beverages. However, critics argue that the law's regressive effects, such as higher fuel prices, have disproportionately affected the poor.

To truly address income inequality, the government must adopt a more comprehensive approach. This includes investing in rural development, expanding access to quality education and healthcare, and creating policies that promote inclusive growth. Strengthening labor protections and implementing a living wage can also help ensure that economic gains are shared more equitably.

The Social and Political Implications
Income inequality has far-reaching consequences for Philippine society. Economically, it hampers growth by limiting the purchasing power of a significant portion of the population. Socially, it fosters resentment and divides communities, creating a sense of hopelessness among the marginalized. Politically, it undermines trust in institutions and fuels populism, as people turn to leaders who promise quick fixes to systemic problems.

The 2022 elections highlighted the role of inequality in shaping political outcomes. Candidates who addressed issues of poverty and inequality resonated with voters, particularly in rural areas. However, translating campaign promises into meaningful action requires political will and a commitment to long-term reforms.

A Call to Action
Addressing income inequality in the Philippines is not an easy task, but it is essential for achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. The government, private sector, and civil society must work together to create a more equitable society where every Filipino has the opportunity to succeed. This requires bold policies, targeted investments, and a commitment to social justice.

By prioritizing education, rural development, and social protection, the Philippines can bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. Empowering marginalized communities, fostering inclusive economic growth, and promoting equitable resource distribution are crucial steps toward a more just and prosperous future. The fight against income inequality is a collective effort, and it is one that the nation cannot afford to lose.

62,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is often referred to as a nation of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). With over 1.83 million Filipinos working abroad as of 2022, OFWs are celebrated for their immense contributions to the country's economy. Their remittances are a cornerstone of the Philippine economy, sustaining millions of families and providing critical support to national development. However, while OFWs are hailed as modern-day heroes, their struggles and the deeper implications of their migration expose the vulnerabilities in the country’s economic framework.

The Economic Impact of OFW Remittances
Remittances from OFWs are among the Philippines' most vital sources of income. In 2022, personal remittances reached $36.14 billion, accounting for roughly 9% of the country's GDP. These funds bolster household consumption, enabling families to afford food, education, healthcare, and housing. Remittances also help stabilize the peso, enhance foreign exchange reserves, and provide a cushion during economic downturns, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For many families, remittances are a lifeline. They help break the cycle of poverty, allowing children to stay in school and ensuring access to better healthcare. On a larger scale, remittances fund local businesses, creating jobs and stimulating economic activity in communities across the Philippines.

However, while these benefits are undeniable, the country's dependence on OFW remittances raises critical questions about long-term sustainability. The Philippines risks relying too heavily on labor exportation as a development strategy rather than focusing on building a robust domestic economy.

The Socioeconomic Cost of Labor Migration
While OFWs contribute significantly to the economy, the personal cost of migration is often steep. Many OFWs leave their families behind, sacrificing years of presence to secure financial stability. The social impact of this separation can be profound, particularly on children who grow up without one or both parents. Studies have shown that these children are more prone to emotional and behavioral issues, despite the financial advantages provided by remittances.

OFWs also face challenges abroad, including exploitative working conditions, racial discrimination, and limited labor rights. Reports of abuse, particularly among domestic workers in the Middle East, highlight the vulnerabilities of Filipino migrants in foreign lands. Despite their invaluable contributions, OFWs often endure hardships that reveal the harsh realities of labor migration.

The Brain Drain Phenomenon
One of the unintended consequences of large-scale labor migration is the phenomenon of ""brain drain."" Many of the country's skilled professionals, including nurses, engineers, and teachers, seek better opportunities abroad due to higher wages and improved working conditions. While their remittances benefit the economy, their absence creates a talent gap in critical sectors, particularly healthcare and education.

For instance, the exodus of Filipino nurses to countries like the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom has strained the local healthcare system. Hospitals face chronic staff shortages, particularly in rural areas, where the need for medical professionals is greatest. This dynamic highlights the double-edged sword of labor migration: while it alleviates poverty for individual families, it often leaves domestic industries struggling to fill critical roles.

Government Policies and Labor Exportation
The Philippine government has institutionalized labor migration through agencies like the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA). These organizations are tasked with regulating overseas employment, protecting migrant workers’ rights, and providing welfare services.

However, critics argue that the government’s reliance on labor exportation is a band-aid solution to deeper economic issues. Instead of creating sufficient job opportunities and ensuring decent wages domestically, the government has leaned on OFW remittances to sustain the economy. This reliance underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to economic development that prioritizes local job creation and industrialization.

Efforts have been made to improve the welfare of OFWs, such as the passage of the ""Migrant Workers Act"" and the establishment of the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW). These initiatives aim to provide greater protection and support for Filipino workers abroad. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure the safety, dignity, and rights of OFWs in their host countries.

OFWs and the Philippine Middle Class
Remittances from OFWs have played a significant role in the emergence of the Philippine middle class. Many OFW families use their earnings to invest in education, small businesses, and real estate, contributing to upward social mobility. This has had a ripple effect on consumer spending, driving demand for goods and services and spurring growth in sectors like retail and real estate.

However, the middle class's growth has also exposed structural inequalities. While some families benefit from remittances, others remain trapped in poverty due to limited access to opportunities. The uneven distribution of wealth underscores the need for inclusive policies that address income inequality and create a level playing field for all Filipinos.

The Path to Sustainable Development
The Philippines must find a way to reduce its dependence on labor exportation while leveraging the benefits of OFW contributions. This requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses both the push and pull factors of migration.

Job Creation and Economic Diversification: The government must prioritize creating quality jobs at home. Investments in manufacturing, technology, and agriculture can provide sustainable employment and reduce the need for Filipinos to seek work abroad.

Improving Domestic Wages and Working Conditions: Many Filipinos migrate due to low wages and poor working conditions. By implementing policies that ensure fair wages, labor protections, and benefits, the government can make domestic employment more attractive.

Investing in Education and Skills Development: Equipping Filipinos with the skills needed for high-demand industries, both locally and globally, can enhance their earning potential and reduce reliance on low-skilled labor migration.

Supporting Return Migrants: Programs that help returning OFWs reintegrate into society and utilize their savings and skills for entrepreneurship can create a multiplier effect in the economy.

Strengthening OFW Protections: While migration remains a reality, the government must continue to advocate for the rights and welfare of Filipino workers abroad. Bilateral agreements with host countries and stronger enforcement of anti-abuse measures are critical.

A Nation of Heroes
OFWs are often called modern-day heroes for a reason. Their sacrifices and hard work sustain millions of Filipino families and contribute significantly to the national economy. However, their stories also reveal the systemic issues that need to be addressed for the Philippines to achieve sustainable and inclusive development.

The challenge lies in creating a society where Filipinos no longer feel compelled to leave their families and country in search of better opportunities. By addressing the root causes of labor migration and building a resilient domestic economy, the Philippines can honor the contributions of OFWs while paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.",1
63,GPT4o-mini,"Food security—the ability of a population to have consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food—is a fundamental human right and an essential foundation for national development. However, in the Philippines, achieving food security has remained a persistent challenge. Despite being an agricultural country with fertile lands and abundant marine resources, the nation continues to grapple with issues such as rising food prices, dependency on imports, and climate-related vulnerabilities. As the country faces these hurdles, it is clear that ensuring food security is both a pressing need and a multifaceted challenge that demands immediate and long-term solutions.

The Current State of Food Security in the Philippines
According to the 2022 Global Hunger Index, the Philippines ranks in the ""serious"" hunger category, reflecting the nation's struggle to provide adequate food for its population. Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reveals that approximately 24% of Filipino families experience food insecurity, a number that has only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, when supply chain disruptions and unemployment drastically reduced access to food.

The Philippine economy has shown remarkable resilience, but the agricultural sector, which should be a cornerstone of food security, has not kept pace with the country's growing population. Agricultural productivity remains stagnant, and the sector accounts for only 9% of the gross domestic product (GDP), despite employing nearly 25% of the workforce. This mismatch underscores the inefficiencies and structural issues within the sector.

Dependency on Food Imports: A Double-Edged Sword
One of the most concerning aspects of food security in the Philippines is its heavy reliance on food imports. Rice, a staple food for Filipinos, is a prime example. While the Philippines is one of the world's largest rice consumers, it has consistently struggled to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production. Instead, it relies on imports from countries such as Vietnam and Thailand to meet its domestic demand.

This dependency on imports leaves the country vulnerable to external shocks, such as rising global food prices and trade restrictions. For instance, the ongoing geopolitical tensions and global supply chain disruptions have caused significant spikes in the cost of imported goods, further straining the budgets of Filipino households. While the government has implemented policies to stabilize rice prices, such as the Rice Tariffication Law, these measures have had mixed results, with some farmers struggling to compete with cheaper imported rice.

Climate Change: A Growing Threat
The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, frequently hit by typhoons, droughts, and other climate-related events. These natural disasters devastate crops, disrupt food supply chains, and exacerbate food insecurity. Typhoon Odette (Rai) in 2021, for example, caused significant damage to agricultural lands, affecting millions of Filipinos' access to food.

Climate change amplifies these challenges. Rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns disrupt planting and harvesting schedules, reduce crop yields, and increase the prevalence of pests and diseases. Coastal communities, which rely on fishing for their livelihoods, are also severely affected by rising sea levels and declining fish stocks due to overfishing and marine pollution.

The Role of Government Policies
The Philippine government has launched numerous initiatives to address food security, but their effectiveness has been mixed. Programs like the ""Plant, Plant, Plant"" initiative, introduced during the pandemic, aimed to boost local food production by encouraging backyard gardening and urban agriculture. While these efforts have had localized successes, they are insufficient to address systemic issues.

The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) was another ambitious policy aimed at redistributing agricultural land to farmers. However, it has been criticized for poor implementation and lack of support for beneficiaries. Many farmers who received land titles under CARP lack access to credit, technology, and infrastructure, leaving them unable to maximize productivity.

Urbanization and Its Impact on Agriculture
Rapid urbanization has further complicated the Philippines' food security. As cities expand, agricultural lands are being converted into residential and commercial spaces. This trend not only reduces the land available for food production but also displaces farming communities, pushing them into poverty and food insecurity.

Metro Manila, for instance, has become heavily reliant on food supplies from neighboring provinces. This dependency creates logistical challenges, particularly during natural disasters or pandemics, when transportation and supply chains are disrupted.

Addressing Food Security: A Multi-Sectoral Approach
Ensuring food security in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. Here are some key strategies:

Investing in Agricultural Development
Increasing investments in the agricultural sector is crucial. This includes providing farmers with access to modern technology, improving irrigation systems, and expanding access to affordable credit. Research and development in climate-resilient crops and sustainable farming practices should also be prioritized.

Promoting Sustainable Practices
Sustainable farming and fishing practices are essential for long-term food security. Initiatives to reduce overfishing, combat marine pollution, and promote organic farming can help protect the country's natural resources and ensure their sustainability for future generations.

Strengthening Local Food Systems
Encouraging local food production through urban agriculture and community-supported farming initiatives can reduce reliance on imports and create more resilient food systems. Government programs should focus on empowering small-scale farmers and fisherfolk, who are often the most vulnerable to food insecurity.

Enhancing Climate Resilience
To mitigate the impacts of climate change, the government should invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant irrigation systems and typhoon-resistant storage facilities. Early warning systems and disaster risk reduction programs can also help protect agricultural communities.

Improving Food Distribution and Logistics
Efficient food distribution systems are critical for reducing food waste and ensuring that food reaches all regions of the country. Investments in transportation infrastructure, cold storage facilities, and digital platforms for supply chain management can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Addressing Poverty and Inequality
Tackling food insecurity requires addressing its root causes, particularly poverty and inequality. Social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, can help vulnerable families access food, while job creation and inclusive economic growth can provide long-term solutions.

The Role of the Private Sector and Civil Society
The private sector and civil society also play a critical role in addressing food security. Private companies can invest in agricultural innovation, create market opportunities for small-scale farmers, and adopt sustainable practices. Civil society organizations can advocate for policy reforms, provide technical assistance to farmers, and raise awareness about food security issues.

A Call to Action
Food security is not just a matter of economic growth or agricultural output; it is a matter of human dignity and national stability. The Philippines has the potential to overcome its food security challenges, but doing so requires collective action from the government, private sector, and civil society.

As the country moves forward, it must prioritize policies and programs that address the root causes of food insecurity while building a more sustainable and resilient food system. The goal should not just be to feed the nation but to nourish it, ensuring that every Filipino has access to the food they need to lead healthy and productive lives.

The time to act is now. Ensuring food security is not just an economic imperative—it is a moral one. By working together, the Philippines can build a future where no one goes hungry, and every Filipino can enjoy the benefits of a truly food-secure nation.",1
64,GPT4o-mini,"The Accessibility of Technology in the Philippines: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities

Digital literacy programs are needed to educate users on topics such as online safety, e-commerce, and basic IT skills.

Policy and Regulation Issues:
Bureaucratic red tape and inconsistent policies have slowed down efforts to expand connectivity. Delays in granting permits for cell tower construction and spectrum allocation have hampered the efforts of telecom companies to improve their services.

Opportunities for Improvement

Despite these challenges, the Philippines presents numerous opportunities to improve technological accessibility and inclusivity.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):
Collaboration between the government and private sector players can accelerate the rollout of digital infrastructure. Initiatives such as the ""Free Wi-Fi for All"" project by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) aim to provide internet access to underserved areas through public Wi-Fi hotspots.

5G Expansion:
The introduction of 5G technology presents an opportunity to revolutionize connectivity in the Philippines. Faster internet speeds and lower latency can support innovations in telemedicine, online education, and e-commerce, particularly in underserved communities.

Affordable Financing Options:
Telecom companies and financial institutions can work together to provide installment plans and microfinancing solutions that make smartphones and data plans more accessible to lower-income individuals.

Community-Based Digital Training:
NGOs and educational institutions can play a vital role in providing grassroots-level training programs that focus on digital literacy, helping bridge the knowledge gap and enabling Filipinos to participate fully in the digital economy.

Localized Solutions:
Technology companies can develop localized apps and platforms that cater to the unique needs of Filipino users, such as content in local languages, financial inclusion tools, and services tailored for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

The Role of Government Initiatives

The Philippine government has taken proactive steps to improve technological accessibility, recognizing its importance for economic growth and social development. Initiatives such as the National Broadband Plan (NBP) aim to expand internet coverage and lower costs by developing a national fiber optic backbone. Meanwhile, the recently passed SIM Card Registration Act and the push for digital ID systems under the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) are steps towards enhancing cybersecurity and streamlining access to online services.

Conclusion

The accessibility of technology in the Philippines is a story of both remarkable progress and persistent challenges. While millions of Filipinos have embraced the digital age, gaps in infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy continue to hinder full inclusion. To ensure that all Filipinos can reap the benefits of digital transformation, a concerted effort from the government, private sector, and civil society is needed. With strategic investments and targeted policies, the Philippines has the potential to bridge the digital divide and create a more inclusive and connected future for all its citizens.",1
65,GPT4o-mini,"The youth of the Philippines have long been considered the hope of the nation. As inheritors of the country's future, they play a pivotal role in shaping its political landscape. In recent years, the involvement of young Filipinos in political discourse, activism, and governance has grown significantly, reflecting their desire to create meaningful change. Their influence extends beyond traditional political avenues, embracing digital platforms and grassroots movements to drive social and political transformation.

Historical Involvement of Filipino Youth in Politics

Throughout Philippine history, the youth have been instrumental in key political movements. The Katipunan, a secret revolutionary society that fought against Spanish colonization, was founded by young revolutionaries like Andres Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto. Decades later, during the Martial Law era in the 1970s, student activists courageously voiced their opposition to the Marcos dictatorship, organizing protests and demanding democratic reforms.

Fast forward to the present day, and the Filipino youth continue to wield significant political influence. The 2016 and 2022 national elections saw record-breaking youth voter registration and participation, highlighting their increasing interest in shaping the country's leadership and policies.

The Digital Revolution and Political Awareness

One of the most profound ways in which the youth have influenced Philippine politics is through digital platforms. Social media has become a powerful tool for political engagement, enabling young Filipinos to stay informed, share their views, and mobilize others. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become battlegrounds for political discourse, fact-checking, and advocacy.

Digital activism has empowered the youth to challenge misinformation, hold leaders accountable, and push for transparency in governance. Online campaigns addressing issues such as climate change, corruption, and human rights violations have gained traction, often leading to real-world actions and policy discussions.

Youth Participation in Governance

Beyond social media activism, young Filipinos are increasingly entering the realm of governance and policymaking. Youth-led organizations and initiatives have emerged to bridge the gap between government and the younger generation. The Sangguniang Kabataan (SK), a youth council within local government units, serves as an avenue for young leaders to engage in public service and policymaking.

While the SK has faced criticism for inefficiency and corruption, recent reforms aim to improve its credibility and effectiveness. With proper guidance and genuine commitment, the youth can harness the potential of the SK to address community issues and advocate for meaningful policies.

Challenges Facing the Youth in Political Engagement

Despite their enthusiasm and potential, the youth face numerous challenges in their political involvement. Misinformation, political disillusionment, and economic constraints often hinder their ability to engage effectively. Some young Filipinos feel discouraged by systemic corruption and the perception that their voices are not being heard.

Additionally, the commercialization of politics and the prevalence of traditional political dynasties present barriers to genuine youth representation. Overcoming these challenges requires sustained efforts in political education, capacity-building, and the promotion of youth-centric policies.

The Way Forward: Empowering the Filipino Youth

To maximize the impact of youth in shaping Philippine politics, various stakeholders must collaborate in fostering an environment that nurtures their political engagement. Schools and universities should strengthen civic education programs, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to critically analyze political issues and engage in constructive dialogue.

Moreover, policymakers and civil society organizations must create more platforms for youth participation in decision-making processes. Encouraging mentorship programs, youth summits, and policy dialogues can help bridge the gap between young people and political leaders.

Lastly, the youth themselves must continue to embrace their role as catalysts for change. Whether through activism, public service, or community involvement, their collective efforts can drive the Philippines toward a more inclusive and progressive political landscape.

Conclusion

The Filipino youth are not just the future of the nation; they are its present. Their growing influence in shaping Philippine politics is a testament to their passion, resilience, and commitment to a better tomorrow. With their continued engagement and empowerment, they hold the power to transform the country's political system and pave the way for a more just and democratic society.",1
66,GPT4o-mini,"For decades, the concept of federalism has been a recurring theme in the political discourse of the Philippines. Advocates argue that it holds the key to balanced regional development and empowerment, while critics warn of potential economic disparities and governance complications. As the debate continues, it is crucial to analyze the benefits, challenges, and the viability of federalism in the context of the Philippines.

Understanding Federalism

Federalism is a system of government that divides power between a central authority and regional governments. Unlike the current unitary system in the Philippines, where authority is highly centralized in Manila, federalism proposes the establishment of autonomous regions with the power to legislate, implement policies, and manage resources according to their local needs.

Countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany have successfully implemented federal systems, allowing regions to address their unique challenges while maintaining national unity. However, for the Philippines, a nation of over 7,000 islands with diverse cultural, linguistic, and economic landscapes, the transition to federalism presents both opportunities and hurdles.

The Case for Federalism

1. Regional Empowerment and Development

Proponents argue that federalism can lead to more equitable development by allowing regions to harness their own resources and craft policies tailored to their specific needs. Under the current centralized system, resource-rich but geographically distant regions, such as Mindanao, often receive disproportionately less funding and attention compared to Metro Manila. Federalism could bridge these gaps by giving regional governments control over revenue generation and expenditure.

2. Decentralization of Power

Federalism offers an opportunity to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption by limiting the concentration of power in the national government. Local leaders, being more attuned to their constituents' needs, could implement policies more effectively without excessive bureaucratic red tape.

3. Preservation of Cultural Identity

With the Philippines' rich tapestry of cultures and languages, federalism could provide a framework for greater cultural expression and preservation. Regions with distinct identities, such as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), could benefit from greater autonomy to promote their own cultural and religious practices.

4. Economic Competitiveness

A federal system may encourage healthy competition among regions, fostering economic growth and innovation. With greater autonomy, regions could attract investments by offering incentives tailored to their local economies, further diversifying the country's economic base.

Challenges of Federalism in the Philippines

1. Economic Disparities

A major concern regarding federalism is the uneven distribution of wealth among regions. Some provinces, particularly in Luzon, have thriving economies, while others, such as those in Eastern Visayas or Mindanao, struggle with poverty and underdevelopment. Critics argue that federalism could exacerbate these inequalities, with wealthier regions advancing while poorer ones fall further behind.

2. Political Dynasties and Corruption

The Philippines has long struggled with entrenched political dynasties and corruption. Critics fear that federalism could empower local elites even further, allowing them to consolidate power and resources within their regions without adequate checks and balances from the central government.

3. Implementation Costs

Transitioning to a federal system would require a complete overhaul of the current government structure, including the creation of new regional administrations, legal frameworks, and resource allocation mechanisms. This shift could be costly and time-consuming, potentially diverting funds away from crucial services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

4. National Unity Concerns

There are fears that federalism could lead to regionalism and fragmentation, weakening national unity. The prospect of autonomous regions crafting their own policies and regulations may create inconsistencies in governance and economic strategy, potentially causing tensions between regions and the central government.

Proposed Federalism Models for the Philippines

Several models have been proposed for the Philippines' shift to federalism, with the most prominent being:

The Duterte Administration's Proposed Federal Charter: This model aimed to establish 18 federated regions with a strong federal government overseeing national concerns such as defense, foreign affairs, and monetary policy.

The Bayanihan Federalism Model: Advocated by the Consultative Committee under President Duterte, this model emphasized inclusivity and social justice, with a focus on equitable resource distribution.

The Pimentel Model: Proposed by former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr., this plan divides the country into 11 federal states based on cultural and economic considerations, granting significant autonomy to each region.

Is Federalism the Right Path for the Philippines?

The answer to whether federalism is suitable for the Philippines is not a simple one. While the system promises greater regional autonomy, decentralization, and cultural preservation, it also presents risks such as increased disparities, political entrenchment, and governance inefficiencies.

The success of federalism would largely depend on meticulous planning, proper execution, and a strong legal framework to ensure accountability, transparency, and fair resource distribution. Strengthening local governance, investing in infrastructure, and addressing corruption must be prioritized to ensure a smooth transition.

Ultimately, the debate over federalism should go beyond political rhetoric and be grounded in comprehensive studies, public consultations, and a clear roadmap that considers the country's socio-political landscape. Whether through constitutional reform or incremental decentralization, the goal should be a governance model that best serves the Filipino people.

Conclusion

Federalism presents a bold vision for the Philippines—one that could empower regions, foster economic growth, and promote cultural diversity. However, without the necessary safeguards, it could also deepen existing divisions and economic inequalities. As the nation grapples with this crucial decision, it is imperative to weigh the potential benefits against the risks and determine whether federalism truly offers a path to a more prosperous and united Philippines.",1
67,GPT4o-mini,"In the Philippines, the integrity of electoral processes is paramount to sustaining a robust democracy. A critical component of this integrity is the transparency of election campaign finances, which ensures that candidates and political parties operate within legal frameworks and maintain public trust. Over the years, the Philippines has established laws and regulations aimed at promoting financial transparency during elections. However, challenges persist, necessitating continuous evaluation and reform.

Legal Framework Governing Campaign Finance

The Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881) serves as the primary legislation governing electoral processes, including campaign finance. Sections 106 to 109 of the Code mandate that every candidate and treasurer of a political party maintain detailed records of all contributions received and expenditures incurred. These records must include the amount and date of each contribution, the full name and address of contributors, and detailed accounts of expenditures. Furthermore, candidates and party treasurers are required to preserve these records for at least three years after the election and produce them for inspection upon request by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) or its authorized representatives. 
ELIBRARY

To prevent undue influence and maintain the integrity of the electoral process, the law prohibits certain entities from making contributions for partisan political activities. These entities include public or private financial institutions, natural and juridical persons operating public utilities or exploiting natural resources, those holding contracts with the government, and foreign nationals or corporations. Additionally, officials and employees in the civil service and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines are barred from making such contributions. 
LAWPHIL

COMELEC's Initiatives to Enhance Transparency

In its ongoing efforts to combat vote-buying and ensure fair elections, COMELEC has implemented measures such as the ""money ban."" This policy prohibits individuals from carrying, possessing, or transporting cash amounts of ₱500,000 or more during specific periods surrounding elections. The ban aims to deter vote-buying by limiting the circulation of large sums of money that could be used to influence voters. Exceptions are made for authorized persons, such as businesspersons and disbursement officials, who can demonstrate legitimate reasons for carrying substantial amounts of cash. 
PHILIPPINE INFORMATION AGENCY

Challenges in Enforcing Financial Transparency

Despite the established legal framework and COMELEC's initiatives, challenges in enforcing campaign finance transparency persist. Instances of non-compliance with reporting requirements, underreporting of contributions and expenditures, and the use of illicit funds continue to undermine the integrity of elections. The case of Alice Guo, the former mayor of Bamban, Tarlac province, illustrates the complexities involved. Guo faced allegations of involvement in financial scams and other illicit activities, raising concerns about the potential for illegal funds to infiltrate political campaigns and the adequacy of existing oversight mechanisms. 
THE GUARDIAN

Recommendations for Strengthening Campaign Finance Transparency

To address these challenges and bolster the transparency of election campaign finances in the Philippines, several measures can be considered:

Enhancing Monitoring and Enforcement: Strengthening the capacity of COMELEC to monitor campaign finances and enforce regulations is crucial. This includes investing in technology to track contributions and expenditures in real-time and increasing the number of personnel dedicated to oversight functions.

Promoting Public Access to Information: Ensuring that campaign finance records are easily accessible to the public can enhance transparency and accountability. Publishing these records online in a user-friendly format would allow citizens and civil society organizations to scrutinize campaign finances effectively.

Implementing Stricter Penalties for Non-Compliance: Imposing more stringent penalties for candidates and parties that fail to comply with reporting requirements or engage in illicit financial activities can serve as a deterrent. This could include substantial fines, disqualification from running for office, or criminal charges in severe cases.

Encouraging Civic Engagement and Oversight: Empowering civil society organizations and the media to play a more active role in monitoring campaign finances can complement official efforts. Training and resources can be provided to these groups to enhance their capacity to detect and report irregularities.

Regularly Updating Legal Frameworks: Continuously reviewing and updating the legal frameworks governing campaign finance to address emerging challenges and close loopholes is essential. This includes adapting to new forms of fundraising and expenditure, such as digital campaigns and crowdfunding.

Conclusion

Financial transparency in election campaigns is fundamental to the health of the Philippines' democracy. While existing laws and regulations provide a solid foundation, ongoing challenges necessitate continuous efforts to strengthen enforcement, enhance public access to information, and promote accountability. By implementing these measures, the Philippines can work towards more transparent and fair elections, thereby reinforcing public trust in the democratic process.",1
68,GPT4o-mini,"Mental health remains a critical yet often overlooked issue in the Philippines. Despite the passing of the Mental Health Act in 2018, which aimed to integrate mental health services into the country's public health system, deep-rooted stigma continues to hinder progress. Societal perceptions, cultural beliefs, and economic barriers all contribute to the difficulty of addressing mental health concerns openly. As the nation grapples with increasing cases of depression, anxiety, and suicide, it becomes imperative to challenge the stigma and create a more supportive environment for those struggling with their mental well-being.

The Cultural Stigma Surrounding Mental Health

In Filipino culture, mental health issues are frequently misunderstood and, in many cases, dismissed entirely. Traditional values that emphasize resilience, family reputation, and religious faith often discourage individuals from seeking professional help. The concept of ""hiya"" (shame) plays a significant role in perpetuating silence, as individuals fear being perceived as weak or burdening their families with their struggles.

Additionally, there remains a prevailing belief that mental health problems are simply a result of a lack of faith or personal weakness. Phrases such as ""Dasal lang yan"" (Just pray) or ""Kaya mo yan"" (You can do it) reflect the cultural inclination to downplay psychological struggles and promote a ""grin and bear it"" mentality. While faith and perseverance are valuable coping mechanisms, they should not replace professional intervention when necessary.

The Role of Media and Misinformation

Media representation in the Philippines has also contributed to the stigma surrounding mental health. Television shows and films often portray individuals with mental illnesses as violent, unstable, or comical, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. These portrayals contribute to public fear and misunderstanding, discouraging those who need help from stepping forward.

Social media, while a potential tool for awareness, can also spread misinformation about mental health. Misinformed advice, self-diagnosis, and stigmatizing language can further alienate those seeking help and reinforce misconceptions within the community.

Barriers to Mental Health Care

Even for those who recognize the importance of mental health, access to professional help remains a significant challenge. In many rural areas, mental health services are either nonexistent or severely lacking, forcing individuals to travel long distances to seek care. The cost of therapy and psychiatric medications can be prohibitive for lower-income families, making mental health care a privilege rather than a right.

Additionally, there is a shortage of trained mental health professionals in the Philippines. According to the Department of Health, there is a stark disparity between the number of individuals requiring mental health services and the available professionals to meet those needs. This shortage leads to long waiting times, inadequate treatment, and further discouragement from seeking help.

Steps Toward Breaking the Stigma

Addressing the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach involving government intervention, community support, and educational initiatives.

1. Government Initiatives and Policy Implementation

While the passage of the Mental Health Act was a significant step forward, full implementation and funding remain crucial. The government must ensure that mental health services are integrated into primary health care centers nationwide, making them accessible to all Filipinos. Training for healthcare providers in mental health awareness and treatment should be prioritized to equip them with the necessary skills to identify and address mental health issues effectively.

2. Public Awareness Campaigns

Awareness campaigns can play a vital role in normalizing conversations about mental health. Social media influencers, celebrities, and local leaders can use their platforms to educate the public and share personal experiences, helping to break down stereotypes and encourage open discussions. National campaigns such as ""#UsapTayo"" (Let's Talk) have already made strides in this area, but more efforts are needed to reach all communities.

3. Incorporating Mental Health Education

Educational institutions should integrate mental health awareness into their curriculum. Teaching students about mental well-being, coping mechanisms, and the importance of seeking help can foster a culture of acceptance and empathy from an early age. Guidance counselors should also receive specialized training to support students facing mental health challenges.

4. Community-Based Support Systems

Grassroots initiatives, such as mental health support groups and peer counseling programs, can provide accessible and relatable support for those in need. Barangay health workers and community leaders should be trained to recognize signs of mental distress and offer initial support or referrals to appropriate services.

5. Encouraging Workplace Mental Health Programs

Employers should be encouraged to implement mental health policies in the workplace. Providing mental health days, offering employee assistance programs, and fostering a supportive work environment can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being.

Moving Forward

Breaking the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires collective effort and a shift in cultural attitudes. By fostering open conversations, increasing access to mental health services, and challenging harmful stereotypes, the country can create a more compassionate and understanding society. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and acknowledging this reality is the first step toward meaningful change.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a Philippines where individuals feel empowered to seek help without fear of judgment, where mental well-being is prioritized, and where no one has to suffer in silence.",1
69,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines, with its rapidly growing urban centers, faces significant challenges in urban congestion and housing shortages. These issues not only hinder economic progress but also impact the quality of life for millions of Filipinos.

The Urbanization Surge

In recent decades, the Philippines has experienced a notable shift from rural to urban living. Cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have become magnets for individuals seeking better employment opportunities and access to services. However, this rapid urbanization has led to overcrowded cities, strained infrastructure, and a burgeoning demand for housing.

The Traffic Conundrum

Metro Manila, the nation's capital region, epitomizes the challenges of urban congestion. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimates that the Philippines loses approximately Php 3.5 billion daily due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila, amounting to Php 1.27 trillion annually. This congestion not only results in lost productivity but also contributes to environmental degradation and increased stress among commuters.

Housing Shortfalls

The surge in urban migration has outpaced the development of affordable housing. The Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) estimates that there are about 1.4 million informal settler families nationwide, with 40% residing in Metro Manila. The total housing units needed this year are projected to reach 6.3 million, with private sector estimates suggesting that the required housing units could reach 12.5 million by 2030. This shortage has led to the proliferation of informal settlements, where residents often lack access to basic services and are vulnerable to environmental hazards.

Government Initiatives

Recognizing the gravity of the housing crisis, the government launched the Pambansang Pabahay Para sa Pilipino Program (4PH) in September 2022. The program aims to build 1 million housing units annually to address the backlog of 6.5 million units. As of April 2023, approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million housing sites have been initiated under this program. Additionally, in July 2023, President Bongbong Marcos issued Executive Order No. 34, directing all National Government Agencies and Instrumentalities, including Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), as well as Local Government Units (LGUs), to submit a detailed inventory of suitable lands for housing to support the program's implementation.

Innovative Urban Planning: The 15-Minute City

To combat urban congestion, some developers are embracing the concept of the ""15-Minute City."" This urban planning model envisions that all essential services—workplaces, schools, healthcare, and recreational facilities—are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from residents' homes. In Metro Manila, developments like MyTown, a network of dormitories near major business districts, exemplify this approach. Residents benefit from reduced commute times, leading to improved productivity and well-being.

The Way Forward

Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multifaceted approach:

Infrastructure Development: Investing in efficient public transportation systems can alleviate traffic congestion and reduce the reliance on private vehicles.

Affordable Housing: Accelerating the construction of affordable housing units and ensuring their strategic location can help accommodate the growing urban population.

Urban Decentralization: Encouraging the development of secondary cities can distribute economic activities more evenly and reduce the pressure on major urban centers.

Sustainable Urban Planning: Implementing concepts like the 15-Minute City can enhance the quality of urban life and promote environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, while the challenges of urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines are significant, strategic planning, robust government initiatives, and innovative urban development models offer a pathway to more livable and sustainable cities for future generations.",1
70,GPT4o-mini,"Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges facing the Philippines today. As an archipelago with over 7,600 islands, the country is uniquely vulnerable to the devastating effects of plastic waste, which threatens marine ecosystems, public health, and economic stability. Despite numerous initiatives and policies aimed at addressing the issue, plastic pollution continues to escalate, demanding urgent and collective action.

The Scope of the Problem

The Philippines is among the world's top contributors to plastic waste, with studies indicating that the country generates approximately 2.7 million tons of plastic waste annually. Alarmingly, around 20% of this plastic ends up in the ocean. The nation's reliance on single-use plastics, such as sachets and plastic bags, exacerbates the crisis. These products are deeply embedded in Filipino culture and consumer habits due to their affordability and convenience, but they come at an immense environmental cost.

One of the key contributors to the plastic waste problem is the lack of efficient waste management infrastructure. In many areas, particularly in urban centers and coastal communities, improper disposal practices, such as open dumping and burning, are prevalent. The absence of proper recycling facilities and segregation practices further complicates efforts to mitigate the crisis.

Impact on Marine Ecosystems

As an island nation, the Philippines boasts rich marine biodiversity, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves that serve as habitats for countless species. However, plastic pollution poses a severe threat to these ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement, which can result in injury or death. Microplastics, tiny plastic particles that originate from larger debris breaking down, have also infiltrated the food chain, posing potential health risks to humans.

Additionally, plastic waste contributes to the destruction of coral reefs, a vital source of livelihood for millions of Filipinos who depend on fishing and tourism. Coral reefs suffocated by plastic debris experience reduced growth rates and increased susceptibility to disease, further threatening the country's food security and economic sustainability.

Public Health Concerns

Beyond environmental impacts, plastic pollution has significant implications for public health in the Philippines. Poorly managed plastic waste often clogs drainage systems, leading to widespread flooding during the rainy season. Floodwaters can become breeding grounds for diseases such as dengue fever and leptospirosis, posing severe health risks to communities.

Moreover, the burning of plastic waste, a common practice in many rural and urban areas, releases toxic chemicals into the air. These pollutants, including dioxins and furans, are known to cause respiratory diseases, hormonal imbalances, and even cancer.

Government Initiatives and Challenges

In response to the growing crisis, the Philippine government has introduced various policies and programs aimed at reducing plastic pollution. The Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (Republic Act 9003) was a landmark legislation designed to promote waste reduction, recycling, and proper disposal. However, implementation at the local level has been inconsistent, hindered by a lack of funding, enforcement, and public awareness.

More recently, several local governments have enacted ordinances banning single-use plastics, such as plastic straws and bags. While these efforts are commendable, they often face resistance from businesses and consumers who rely on these products for their daily needs.

Corporate Responsibility and Consumer Action

The private sector plays a crucial role in combating plastic pollution in the Philippines. Major corporations, particularly those in the food and beverage industry, are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable packaging alternatives and reduce their plastic footprint. Some companies have responded by implementing take-back programs, promoting reusable packaging, and investing in biodegradable alternatives.

Consumers, too, have a role to play in addressing the crisis. Small changes in daily habits, such as using reusable bags, bottles, and containers, can collectively make a significant impact. Public education and awareness campaigns are essential in encouraging behavioral changes and fostering a culture of environmental responsibility.

Innovative Solutions and the Path Forward

While the plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines is daunting, there are innovative solutions that offer hope. Community-based recycling initiatives, such as ""eco-bricks"" made from compressed plastic waste, provide creative ways to repurpose plastics and reduce landfill contributions. Additionally, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and advocacy groups have been instrumental in spearheading beach clean-ups, policy advocacy, and awareness campaigns.

Technology and scientific research can also play a role in addressing the crisis. Emerging solutions, such as biodegradable plastics derived from natural materials and plastic-eating bacteria, hold promise in reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste.

Conclusion: A Call to Collective Action

The plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach that involves government action, corporate responsibility, and public participation. Strengthening waste management systems, enforcing existing regulations, and fostering innovation are essential steps toward a cleaner and more sustainable future.

Every Filipino has a role to play in combating plastic pollution, whether through responsible consumption, advocacy, or community involvement. By working together, the Philippines can protect its precious natural resources and ensure a healthier, more sustainable environment for future generations.",1
71,Llama3.2,"As one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, the Philippines has been touted as a beacon of hope for economic development and prosperity. However, beneath its impressive GDP growth rate lies a stark reality that has left millions of Filipinos struggling to make ends meet. The country's income inequality crisis is a ticking time bomb, threatening to destabilize social cohesion and undermine the very foundations of democracy.

The numbers are alarming. According to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country's Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, has been steadily increasing over the past two decades. In 2020, it reached a staggering 40.3, ranking the Philippines alongside South Africa and Brazil as one of the most unequal countries in the world. This means that nearly half of the population lives below the poverty line, with many more struggling to survive on meager incomes.

The effects of income inequality are far-reaching and devastating. Families are torn apart as parents sacrifice their own well-being for the sake of their children, who often drop out of school or enter the workforce at an early age to support their families. Communities are fragmented, with the rich and powerful wielding disproportionate influence over local politics and development projects.

The root causes of income inequality in the Philippines are complex and multifaceted. One major factor is the country's labor market, which has been driven by a series of neoliberal reforms that prioritize foreign investment and economic growth over social welfare and job security. The resulting ""gig economy"" has created an army of precarious workers who are denied basic rights and protections.

Another significant contributor to income inequality is the Philippines' skewed distribution of wealth. According to a report by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the country's wealthiest 10% hold over 30% of its total wealth, while the bottom 40% have less than 1%. This concentration of wealth has been fueled by decades of crony capitalism and corruption, which has allowed a small elite to accumulate vast fortunes at the expense of the majority.

The government's response to income inequality has been woefully inadequate. While President Rodrigo Duterte has made some token gestures towards social welfare and poverty reduction, his administration's focus on economic growth and infrastructure development has largely ignored the needs of the most vulnerable segments of society.

In recent years, there have been calls for a more radical approach to addressing income inequality in the Philippines. Some advocates have proposed a wealth tax or inheritance tax to redistribute wealth and fund social programs. Others have suggested implementing a universal basic income (UBI) to ensure that every citizen has access to a minimum standard of living.

However, such proposals are often met with fierce resistance from politicians and business leaders who see them as threats to economic growth and stability. The Philippines is a major recipient of foreign investment, and its government has been reluctant to implement policies that might alienate potential investors or stifle economic development.

As the global conversation around income inequality continues to grow, it is clear that the Philippines cannot afford to ignore this crisis any longer. The country needs a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of poverty and inequality, while also promoting inclusive growth and social welfare. This requires a fundamental transformation of its economic policies and institutions, as well as a renewed commitment to social justice and human rights.

One potential solution is the implementation of progressive taxation, which would shift the burden of taxation from the poor and middle class to the wealthy elite. Another approach could be to increase access to education and job training programs, which would enable more Filipinos to acquire skills and secure better-paying jobs.

Ultimately, addressing income inequality in the Philippines will require a sustained effort from government, civil society, and the private sector. It demands a willingness to challenge entrenched interests and power structures, while also promoting greater economic inclusivity and social cohesion.

As we look to the future, it is clear that the Philippines cannot afford to ignore its income inequality crisis any longer. The country has a unique opportunity to learn from other nations and pioneer new models of inclusive growth and poverty reduction. By working together, we can build a more just and equitable society for all Filipinos – where everyone has access to opportunities and resources to thrive.

72,Llama3.2,"As one of the world's top remittance-receiving countries, the Philippines has long been synonymous with the sacrifices made by its Overseas Foreign Workers (OFWs). These dedicated individuals have been the backbone of our economy for decades, sending home billions of pesos every year to support their families and loved ones back home. However, despite their immense contributions, OFWs continue to face unimaginable hardships and exploitation.

The Philippine government has often touted OFWs as a symbol of national pride, highlighting their dedication and resilience in the face of adversity. And while it is true that many OFWs embody these traits, it is equally important to acknowledge the numerous challenges they face on the job and back home.

One of the most significant issues affecting OFWs is the lack of adequate protection and support from their employers. Many OFWs are forced to work in hazardous conditions, with minimal benefits and no social security. They are often subjected to physical and emotional abuse, as well as exploitation by unscrupulous employers who take advantage of their vulnerability.

The Philippine government has implemented various measures to address these concerns, including the passage of the Migrant Workers Act of 2004 and the establishment of the Department of Labor and Employment's (DOLE) Migrant Workers Division. However, despite these efforts, many OFWs continue to suffer from poor working conditions and inadequate compensation.

Another critical issue affecting OFWs is the lack of access to quality healthcare and social services back home. Many OFWs face long waiting periods for medical treatment, and those who fall ill often have to rely on their families or charitable organizations for support.

The economic impact of OFWs cannot be overstated. According to a report by the World Bank, remittances from OFWs account for approximately 10% of the country's GDP, making them a crucial component of our economy. In fact, remittances have been instrumental in mitigating poverty and reducing income inequality in the Philippines.

However, despite their significance, OFWs often receive little to no credit for their contributions to the Philippine economy. Their sacrifices are frequently overlooked, and their earnings are often seen as mere pocket change by those who reap the benefits of their labor.

This oversight is particularly galling given the historical injustices faced by Filipino migrants abroad. For generations, Filipinos have been forced to seek employment in foreign lands, often under exploitative conditions. The United States, Japan, and other major economies have long exploited Filipino migrant laborers, denying them basic rights and protections.

In recent years, however, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of OFWs to our economy and society. The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives aimed at improving working conditions and providing support services for OFWs, including the establishment of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).

The private sector has also begun to take notice of the critical role OFWs play in our economy. Many companies have started to recognize the value of their migrant workers and are implementing measures to improve working conditions and provide better compensation.

As we look to the future, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being and rights of our OFWs. This requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of exploitation and neglect. It also demands greater recognition and appreciation for the sacrifices made by these dedicated individuals.

One potential solution is the implementation of stricter regulations on employers of migrant workers, including mandatory health checks and regular inspections to ensure compliance with labor laws. Another approach could be to increase access to quality healthcare and social services back home, particularly in rural areas where OFWs often reside.

Ultimately, addressing the plight of our OFWs requires a fundamental shift in how we view their contributions to our economy and society. We must recognize that these individuals are not just workers or sources of remittances; they are also human beings deserving of dignity, respect, and protection.

As the Philippines continues to grow and develop as an economy, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being and rights of our OFWs. By doing so, we can create a more just and equitable society where all individuals, regardless of their nationality or employment status, are treated with dignity and respect.

73,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, boasting some of the world's most fertile soil and diverse ecosystems. However, despite its natural endowments, the country is facing a growing crisis that threatens the very foundation of our national identity: food security.

Food security, defined as access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food at all times, is a fundamental human right. Yet, for millions of Filipinos, this right remains an unattainable dream. The Philippines ranks among the world's most food-insecure countries, with over 40% of the population relying on non-food cash income or other means to purchase basic necessities.

The root causes of our food insecurity are multifaceted and complex. Climate change is a major contributor, as rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters have led to reduced crop yields, decreased agricultural productivity, and disrupted food systems. The country's dependence on imported rice, for example, has become unsustainable due to the increasing costs associated with transportation, storage, and logistics.

Another significant factor is the Philippines' vulnerability to external shocks in the global market. Trade wars, price volatility, and supply chain disruptions have all taken a toll on our agricultural sector, making it difficult for farmers to maintain profitability and invest in sustainable practices.

Domestically, our food security situation is further complicated by inadequate policies and lack of investment in agriculture. The Philippine government's priorities have historically been skewed towards economic growth and infrastructure development, leaving the country's agricultural sector to fend for itself.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to address these challenges and prioritize food security as a national priority. The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting agricultural development, improving access to markets, and increasing support for small-scale farmers.

One notable example is the country's National Food Security Program (NFSP), launched in 2013 with the aim of increasing rice production and reducing import dependence. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done.

Another critical area is the need for climate-resilient agriculture. The Philippines is vulnerable to various types of natural hazards, including typhoons, droughts, and floods, which can have devastating impacts on agricultural productivity. Climate-smart agriculture practices, such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture, offer promising solutions that can help farmers adapt to these challenges.

However, despite these efforts, the Philippines still faces significant hurdles in achieving food security. One major challenge is the lack of access to basic services for small-scale farmers, including credit, extension services, and market information.

Moreover, our country's agricultural sector remains heavily reliant on monoculture farming practices, which can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices, such as permaculture and agroecology, is essential for building resilience in the face of climate change.

The solution to our food security crisis lies not just in policy or technology, but also in behavioral change. We need a cultural shift that prioritizes food sovereignty, recognizes the value of traditional farming practices, and promotes sustainable consumption patterns.

In conclusion, the Philippines' struggle for food security is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and collective action. By addressing our dependence on imported rice, investing in climate-resilient agriculture, and promoting sustainable food systems, we can build a more resilient and equitable food future for all Filipinos.

As we look to the future, it is essential that we engage in an open and inclusive dialogue with stakeholders across sectors – policymakers, farmers, researchers, and consumers. Together, we must chart a course that balances economic growth with social justice and environmental sustainability.

The Philippines' food security crisis is not just about meeting our basic needs; it's about preserving the country's rich cultural heritage and protecting its natural resources for future generations. By working together, we can create a more food-secure and sustainable future – one where every Filipino has access to nutritious, affordable, and locally produced food.",1
74,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is one of the most digitally advanced countries in Southeast Asia, boasting a growing middle class and a vibrant tech industry. However, despite its progress, the country still lags behind in terms of access to technology, particularly for rural communities.

In today's digital age, having access to technology is no longer a luxury but a necessity. It has become a key driver of economic growth, social mobility, and overall well-being. Yet, for millions of Filipinos, especially those living in rural areas, the internet remains a distant dream.

The digital divide in the Philippines is a stark reminder of the country's unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. While urban centers like Manila and Cebu have made significant strides in adopting technology, many rural communities remain disconnected from the digital world.

One of the primary reasons for this disconnect is the lack of infrastructure. Many rural areas lack access to reliable internet connectivity, making it difficult for residents to stay connected with family, friends, and businesses.

The government has implemented various initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide, including the creation of the Department of Science and Technology's (DOST) National Broadband Plan. However, these efforts have been slow to materialize, leaving many Filipinos frustrated and disappointed.

Another significant challenge is the lack of affordable technology. Many rural communities struggle to afford basic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, making it difficult for them to access online services.

The impact of this digital divide cannot be overstated. Rural communities are missing out on essential services such as online banking, e-commerce, and healthcare. They are also being left behind in the global economy, with limited opportunities for education, employment, and social mobility.

However, there is hope. The private sector has stepped up to fill the gap, with companies like Globe Telecom and PLDT launching initiatives aimed at increasing internet penetration and affordability in rural areas.

One notable example is Globe's ""Globe at Home"" program, which provides affordable internet access to rural communities. This initiative has already made a significant impact, with thousands of households now enjoying reliable internet connectivity for the first time.

Another promising development is the growth of mobile payments and digital wallets. Initiatives such as PayMaya and GCash have made it possible for Filipinos to access financial services online, increasing convenience and reducing transaction costs.

However, more needs to be done. The government must prioritize investments in rural infrastructure, including broadband networks, to ensure that everyone has access to reliable internet connectivity.

Additionally, there is a need for greater awareness about the importance of digital literacy. Many rural Filipinos lack basic computer skills, making it difficult for them to navigate online services and take advantage of new technologies.

In conclusion, the Philippines' digital divide is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. While progress has been made, much more needs to be done to ensure that everyone has access to technology, regardless of their location or socio-economic status.

As we move forward, it is essential that we prioritize investments in rural infrastructure and digital literacy programs. We must also work with the private sector to increase affordability and accessibility of technology.

By bridging the gap between urban and rural communities, we can create a smarter nation where everyone has access to the opportunities and services they need to thrive. It's time for the Philippines to become a leader in the digital age, and it starts with making our country more accessible to all Filipinos.

75,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is at a crossroads. As the country navigates the complexities of modern politics, it is clear that the youth will play a pivotal role in shaping its destiny. With over 60% of the population under the age of 30, young Filipinos are increasingly taking center stage in Philippine politics.

For decades, the Philippines has struggled with an aging leadership. The country's politicians have often been out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of younger generations. However, with the rise of social media and increased access to information, young Filipinos are now more empowered than ever to engage with politics and demand change.

One of the key drivers of this shift is the growth of youth activism in the Philippines. Organizations such as the Youth Against Corruption (YAC) and the Kabataan Partylist have become powerful voices in Philippine politics, advocating for issues such as climate change, education, and social justice.

Young Filipinos are also increasingly using social media to express their opinions and mobilize support for their causes. The hashtag #Election2019, which trended on Twitter during the 2019 presidential election, was a testament to the power of young people's activism.

However, despite these efforts, young Filipinos still face significant barriers when it comes to participating in politics. Many are excluded from the electoral process due to lack of registration or identification documents, while others may not have access to quality education or job opportunities that would allow them to pursue careers in public service.

To address these challenges, the government must prioritize initiatives that increase youth participation in politics. This includes expanding voter registration drives, improving access to education and job training programs, and increasing awareness about civic engagement and voting.

Another key strategy is to empower young Filipinos as leaders and decision-makers within their communities. This can be achieved through mentorship programs, leadership training, and opportunities for internships and volunteer work in government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The Philippines also needs to recognize the value of youth voices in policy-making. The country's current leadership often overlooks the concerns and opinions of younger generations, instead prioritizing the interests of established politicians and business leaders.

To change this narrative, the government must create more inclusive decision-making processes that incorporate diverse perspectives and age groups. This can be achieved through the establishment of youth-focused councils or advisory boards that provide input on key policy decisions.

Finally, young Filipinos need to take ownership of their own empowerment. They must demand greater representation in politics and government, and be willing to challenge the status quo when necessary.

In conclusion, the Philippines is at a critical juncture in its development as a country. As the youth population continues to grow and become more influential, it is imperative that policymakers recognize their value and empower them to shape the country's destiny.

By prioritizing initiatives that increase youth participation in politics, empowering young Filipinos as leaders and decision-makers, recognizing their value in policy-making, and taking ownership of their own empowerment, we can create a brighter future for all Filipinos. The future of Philippine politics is in the hands of young people – let us give them the tools and support they need to succeed.

76,Llama3.2,"The concept of federalism has been debated in the Philippines for decades, with some arguing that it is the only way to address the country's deep-seated regional and socio-economic disparities. The idea of a more decentralized system of government, where power is divided between a central authority and regional governments, has gained significant traction in recent years.

The current Philippine government, led by President Rodrigo Duterte, has been exploring options for federalism as a way to address the country's long-standing issues with regional autonomy and representation. The proposal aims to create a more inclusive and equitable system of governance that recognizes the diversity of regional cultures, languages, and interests.

One of the primary arguments in favor of federalism is its ability to address regional disparities. Under the current system, regional development is largely controlled by the central government, with limited autonomy for local governments to make decisions about their own affairs. Federalism, on the other hand, would grant more power to regional governments, allowing them to make decisions that are tailored to their specific needs and circumstances.

Another key benefit of federalism is its ability to promote greater representation and participation in governance. Under a federal system, regional governments would have a stronger presence in national politics, ensuring that local voices are heard and represented at the highest levels of government. This would be particularly beneficial for marginalized communities, who often feel left behind by central government policies.

However, there are also concerns about the potential drawbacks of federalism. Some argue that it could lead to greater fragmentation and instability, as regional governments may have competing interests and priorities. Others worry that a more decentralized system of government could create bureaucratic inefficiencies and duplication of efforts.

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that the benefits of federalism outweigh its costs. For example, a study by the University of the Philippines found that a federal system would lead to greater regional growth and development, as well as increased investment in public goods and services.

Another key proponent of federalism is Senator Manny Pacquiao, who has been a strong advocate for the concept throughout his career. Pacquiao argues that a federal system would allow the country to better address its deep-seated socio-economic disparities, and to create more opportunities for economic growth and development.

However, not all Filipinos are convinced of the benefits of federalism. Some argue that it could lead to greater regionalism and fragmentation, undermining the country's national unity and cohesion. Others worry about the potential costs of implementing a new system of government, particularly in terms of infrastructure and institutional capacity.

In conclusion, federalism is an idea whose time has come in the Philippines. The current system of governance has failed many Filipinos, particularly those living outside of Manila, who feel left behind by central government policies. A more decentralized system of government would allow for greater regional autonomy, representation, and participation, addressing the country's deep-seated socio-economic disparities.

While there are certainly challenges to implementing federalism, many experts believe that its benefits outweigh its costs. The future of Philippine governance is at a crossroads, and it is time for the country to consider a new era of governance that reflects the needs and aspirations of all Filipinos.",1
77,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is set to hold another historic presidential election, one that promises to be a defining moment for the country's democracy. However, amidst all the hype and excitement, a more pressing concern looms over the campaign trail - the lack of transparency in election campaign financing.

For decades, the Philippines has been plagued by a culture of corruption and cronyism in politics. The country's elections have long been marred by allegations of vote-rigging, bribery, and other forms of electoral malfeasance. One of the major contributing factors to this problem is the lack of transparency in election campaign financing.

Under current laws, politicians are allowed to raise funds from a variety of sources, including donations from individuals, corporations, and special interest groups. However, these campaigns often operate in the shadows, with little disclosure about their funding sources or expenditures.

This lack of transparency creates an environment that fosters corruption and cronyism. Politicians may feel pressure to accept donations from certain groups or individuals in order to secure support for their campaign, even if those donations come with strings attached. This can lead to a situation where politicians are beholden to powerful interests rather than the people they represent.

Furthermore, the lack of transparency in election campaign financing makes it difficult to hold politicians accountable for their actions. Without clear disclosure about who is funding their campaigns and how that money is being spent, voters have no way of knowing whether they are voting for a candidate who truly represents their interests or one who is beholden to special interests.

To address this problem, the Philippines needs to implement more robust campaign finance regulations. This could include requirements for candidates to disclose their donors and expenditures in real-time, as well as limits on the amount of money that can be raised and spent by each candidate.

Another important step would be to establish an independent agency responsible for enforcing these regulations. This agency should have the power to investigate allegations of corruption and malfeasance, and to take action against candidates who fail to comply with campaign finance laws.

The benefits of stronger campaign finance regulations in the Philippines would be numerous. For one, they would help to increase transparency and accountability in politics. By requiring candidates to disclose their donors and expenditures, voters would have a better understanding of who is backing each candidate's campaign and what policies they are advocating for.

Additionally, stronger campaign finance regulations could help to reduce corruption and cronyism in politics. By limiting the amount of money that can be raised and spent by each candidate, politicians would be less tempted to accept donations from special interest groups or individuals with hidden agendas.

Finally, stronger campaign finance regulations could help to level the playing field for smaller candidates and independent organizations. Under current laws, larger campaigns often have a significant advantage when it comes to fundraising, which can make it difficult for smaller candidates to compete.

In conclusion, election campaign financial transparency is a critical issue in the Philippines. The lack of transparency in campaign financing creates an environment that fosters corruption and cronyism, making it difficult for voters to hold politicians accountable for their actions.

To address this problem, the Philippines needs to implement stronger campaign finance regulations, including requirements for disclosure and limits on fundraising. By taking these steps, the country can increase transparency and accountability in politics, reduce corruption and cronyism, and ensure that every vote counts.",1
78,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is a country plagued by numerous social and economic challenges, but one issue that continues to affect millions of Filipinos remains shrouded in secrecy and stigma - mental health. Despite being a major public health concern, mental illness is often stigmatized and misunderstood, leading to a lack of access to treatment and support for those who need it most.

The stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines can be attributed to various factors, including cultural and social norms, lack of education and awareness, and historical experiences of colonialism and foreign influence. In many Filipino households, mental illness is seen as a personal failing or a sign of weakness, rather than a legitimate medical condition that requires treatment and support.

This stigma is particularly damaging for individuals who are already vulnerable due to factors such as poverty, lack of education, and limited access to healthcare. Those struggling with mental health issues may be reluctant to seek help due to fear of being labeled as ""crazy"" or ""weak"", leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

The consequences of this stigma are far-reaching. Mental illness is a major contributor to disability and mortality worldwide, and the Philippines is no exception. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health disorders affect an estimated 12% of the Philippine population, with depression being the most common condition.

Furthermore, the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines can have a negative impact on the economy and society as a whole. A study by the Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) found that mental health issues can lead to reduced productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism (being physically present but not fully productive), resulting in significant economic losses.

To break down this stigma, it is essential to increase awareness and understanding of mental health among Filipinos. This can be achieved through various means, including education and training programs for healthcare professionals, community outreach and support services, and advocacy campaigns to raise awareness about mental health issues.

One notable example of a successful initiative to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines is the #BreakTheStigma campaign launched by the Philippine Psychiatric Association (PPA). The campaign aims to promote mental health awareness and education through social media, public events, and partnerships with schools, workplaces, and community organizations.

Another critical step towards reducing the stigma is to ensure that mental health services are accessible and affordable for all Filipinos. This can be achieved by increasing funding for mental health programs, expanding access to healthcare facilities, and promoting the use of telepsychiatry and other innovative technologies.

In addition, policymakers must take a proactive role in addressing the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines. The government has a responsibility to ensure that mental health services are included in the National Health Act, and that policies and programs are implemented to promote mental health awareness and education.

The journey towards greater awareness and understanding of mental health in the Philippines will not be easy. It requires a sustained effort from individuals, organizations, and governments to break down the stigma and promote a culture of inclusivity and support.

However, the benefits of this journey are well worth the effort. By reducing the stigma surrounding mental health, we can create a society where individuals feel comfortable seeking help when they need it most, and where mental illness is seen as a treatable medical condition rather than a personal failing.

In conclusion, breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, awareness, advocacy, and access to treatment. By working together, we can create a society where mental health is prioritized and supported, and where all Filipinos have access to the care and support they need to thrive.",1
79,Llama3.2,"As the Philippines continues to grow and develop, two of its most pressing challenges are urban congestion and housing shortages. The country's rapid urbanization has led to a surge in population growth, resulting in overcrowding and congestion in cities like Manila, Cebu, and Davao.

Urban congestion is a major issue in the Philippines, with commuters spending hours stuck in traffic every day. This not only affects productivity but also leads to increased air pollution, noise pollution, and stress levels. In fact, according to a study by the University of the Philippines, urban congestion costs the country's economy approximately P1.3 trillion (approximately USD 25 billion) annually.

The housing shortage is another pressing issue in the Philippines. With limited land supply and increasing demand for housing, prices have skyrocketed, making it difficult for low- and middle-income families to afford a decent place to live. According to data from the National Homeowners Association of the Philippines (NHA), there are over 2 million households living in informal settlements, with many more waiting lists for government-assisted housing programs.

The combination of urban congestion and housing shortages has far-reaching consequences for individuals, communities, and the economy as a whole. For instance, research by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) found that congested cities like Manila lead to increased health risks due to air pollution, heat stress, and reduced access to healthcare services.

Moreover, the lack of affordable housing options exacerbates social inequality in the Philippines. Families are forced to spend a significant portion of their income on rent or mortgage payments, leaving them with limited resources for other essential expenses like food, education, and healthcare. This perpetuates cycles of poverty and limits opportunities for economic mobility.

To address these pressing issues, policymakers must adopt a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes sustainable urban planning, affordable housing, and public transportation development. One effective strategy is to implement smart growth policies that encourage mixed-use development, denser settlements, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.

For example, the city of Makati's ""Smart Growth Plan"" promotes mixed-use development and efficient land use to reduce congestion and increase housing affordability. Similarly, the municipality of Taguig has implemented a ""Pedestrian-Friendly Infrastructure Plan"" that prioritizes walking and cycling infrastructure over car-centric designs.

Another critical step is to improve public transportation options in urban areas. The Philippines can learn from successful models like Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system or Hong Kong's Octopus card, which provide efficient, affordable, and reliable transportation services for commuters.

The government also plays a crucial role in addressing these issues. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHUD) should prioritize affordable housing programs that provide financing options for low- and middle-income families. Moreover, the Land Use Regulatory Board (LUB) should be empowered to enforce zoning regulations and ensure that new developments are designed with sustainability and community needs in mind.

The private sector also has a vital role to play in addressing urban congestion and housing shortages. Developers can prioritize affordable housing options, while transportation companies can invest in efficient public transportation systems. Businesses can also adopt flexible work arrangements that promote telecommuting or flexible schedules to reduce the need for lengthy commutes.

In conclusion, the Philippines' urban congestion and housing shortages are pressing issues that require a comprehensive response. By prioritizing sustainable urban planning, affordable housing, and public transportation development, we can create more livable cities where all Filipinos can thrive.",1
80,Llama3.2,"The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, has long been known for its rich marine biodiversity and pristine beaches. However, in recent years, the country's beauty and natural resources have come under threat from a growing menace: plastic pollution.

Every day, millions of tons of plastic waste are generated in the Philippines, with much of it ending up in our oceans, rivers, and landscapes. The effects of plastic pollution on the environment, human health, and the economy are far-reaching and devastating.

One of the most alarming statistics is that the Philippines generates over 2 million metric tons of plastic waste annually, with only about 20% being recycled or properly disposed of. The rest ends up in our oceans, where it harms marine life, contaminates the food chain, and poses a threat to human health.

The impacts of plastic pollution on the environment are numerous and severe. Plastic debris in our oceans has been found to be ingested by marine animals, including fish, birds, and mammals, which can lead to blockages, nutrient deficiencies, and even death. Sea turtles, in particular, are vulnerable to plastic pollution, with millions of them entangled or trapped in plastic waste every year.

The effects of plastic pollution on human health are equally concerning. Exposure to plastic debris has been linked to a range of health problems, including cancer, reproductive issues, and respiratory diseases. Additionally, the ingestion of microplastics by humans can lead to the consumption of toxic chemicals, which can have serious consequences for our health.

Furthermore, plastic pollution is also having a significant impact on the economy. The country's tourism industry is a major contributor to its GDP, but the presence of plastic waste in popular tourist destinations is driving visitors away and hurting local businesses.

To address this growing concern, the government must take immediate action to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable practices. One effective strategy is to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies, which hold manufacturers responsible for the waste generated by their products.

For example, the country can adopt a ban on single-use plastics, such as straws, bags, and water bottles, and replace them with biodegradable alternatives. This will not only reduce the amount of plastic waste but also promote innovation in sustainable packaging materials.

Another critical step is to increase public awareness and education about the impacts of plastic pollution. Governments, schools, and community organizations must work together to educate people about the importance of proper waste management and recycling.

Individuals can also make a difference by making conscious choices in their daily lives. Using reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups can significantly reduce our plastic usage. Additionally, supporting businesses that prioritize sustainability and use eco-friendly packaging materials is essential.

In conclusion, plastic pollution is a growing concern in the Philippines that requires immediate attention and action. The government, industries, and individuals must work together to reduce plastic waste, promote sustainable practices, and protect our environment for future generations.",1
81,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, a nation blessed with abundant natural resources and a vibrant culture, grapples with a persistent and deeply rooted issue: income inequality. This stark disparity in wealth distribution casts a long shadow over the country's social and economic landscape, hindering progress and undermining the promise of a prosperous future for all Filipinos.

A Nation Divided:

The gap between the rich and the poor in the Philippines is significant and widening. The Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality, consistently places the Philippines among the most unequal countries in Southeast Asia. This translates to a reality where a small segment of the population enjoys a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth, while a vast majority struggle to meet basic needs.

The consequences of this inequality are far-reaching and deeply concerning:

Poverty and Social Exclusion: Millions of Filipinos live in poverty, lacking access to basic necessities like food, clean water, and healthcare. This poverty cycle perpetuates itself, trapping families in a cycle of deprivation and limiting their opportunities for social and economic mobility.
Social Unrest and Instability: Extreme inequality fuels social unrest and instability. The frustration and resentment felt by the marginalized can manifest in various forms, from social protests and crime to political instability.

Land Reform Challenges: Despite decades of efforts, land reform remains an unfinished agenda. Many Filipino farmers continue to face challenges such as landlessness, low productivity, and limited access to markets, trapping them in poverty.
Corruption and Inefficient Governance: Corruption at all levels of government siphons off resources that could be used for social programs and infrastructure development, further exacerbating inequality.
Weak Social Safety Nets: The government's social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, while helpful, are often insufficient to address the complex needs of the most vulnerable populations.
Addressing the Challenge:

Tackling income inequality requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of the problem. Key strategies include:

Investing in Human Capital: Prioritizing investments in education, from early childhood development to higher education, is crucial. This includes improving access to quality education for all, expanding vocational training programs, and strengthening the skills of the workforce to meet the demands of the modern economy.
Promoting Inclusive Growth: Economic growth must be inclusive and benefit all sectors of society. This requires policies that support small and medium enterprises, promote rural development, and create decent jobs for all Filipinos.
Land Reform and Agrarian Reform: Implementing genuine land reform is essential to empower farmers and improve agricultural productivity. This includes providing farmers with secure land tenure, access to credit, and support for sustainable agricultural practices.
Strengthening Social Safety Nets: Expanding and improving social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, is crucial to protect the most vulnerable members of society from poverty and ensure their basic needs are met.
Good Governance and Transparency: Combating corruption and promoting good governance are essential to ensure that public resources are used effectively and efficiently for the benefit of all Filipinos.
Empowering Women and Marginalized Groups: Empowering women and marginalized groups, such as indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities, is crucial for reducing inequality and promoting social justice.
Conclusion:

Income inequality is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a sustained and concerted effort from the government, the private sector, and civil society. By addressing the root causes of inequality, investing in human capital, promoting inclusive growth, and strengthening social safety nets, the Philippines can build a more equitable and just society where all Filipinos have the opportunity to thrive.

This is not merely a social justice issue; it is an economic imperative. A more equitable society is a more stable and prosperous society. By tackling income inequality, the Philippines can unleash its full potential and build a brighter future for all its citizens.",1
82,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines stands as a testament to the global phenomenon of labor migration. Millions of Filipinos, known as Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), have left their homeland in search of better opportunities abroad. While their remittances have become a crucial lifeline for the Philippine economy, this reliance presents a complex paradox: progress fueled by a significant human cost.   

The Economic Lifeline:

OFW remittances constitute a substantial portion of the Philippine economy, surpassing even foreign direct investment. These funds directly impact household consumption, driving demand for goods and services, and contributing significantly to poverty reduction. Remittances have fueled infrastructure development, supported education, and improved living standards for many Filipino families.

Furthermore, OFWs contribute significantly to foreign exchange reserves, bolstering the country's balance of payments. Their skills and expertise acquired abroad can potentially contribute to the development of the domestic workforce upon their return, although the extent of this ""brain gain"" remains a subject of debate.   

The Human Cost:

However, the economic benefits of OFW remittances come at a significant human cost. The prolonged separation of families can have profound social and emotional consequences, leading to strained relationships, broken families, and even the erosion of traditional family values. Children of OFWs often experience emotional distress, neglect, and difficulties in their social and academic development.   

The physical and emotional well-being of OFWs themselves is also a major concern. They face numerous challenges abroad, including exploitation, abuse, and discrimination. Issues such as unfair labor practices, wage theft, and even human trafficking remain prevalent despite government efforts to protect their rights. The psychological toll of living and working far from home, often under stressful conditions, can lead to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.   

Beyond Remittances: A Path Towards Sustainable Development

The Philippine government must shift its focus beyond mere reliance on remittances and strive towards creating a more sustainable and equitable economic model. This requires a multi-pronged approach:

Investing in Human Capital: Prioritizing investments in education and skills development is crucial to equip Filipinos with the necessary skills to compete in the global job market and create a more robust domestic economy.
Promoting Job Creation: The government must actively promote job creation within the Philippines through policies that encourage entrepreneurship, support small and medium enterprises, and invest in key sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and agriculture.   
Addressing Root Causes of Migration: Addressing the root causes of labor migration, such as poverty, unemployment, and inequality, is essential. This requires implementing effective social safety nets, improving access to quality healthcare and education, and promoting inclusive growth that benefits all sectors of society.
Protecting the Rights of OFWs: Strengthening the legal framework for the protection of OFWs' rights, ensuring their safety and well-being abroad, and providing effective mechanisms for addressing grievances are crucial.
Harnessing the Skills and Expertise of Returning OFWs: The government must implement programs to effectively reintegrate returning OFWs into the Philippine workforce, leveraging their skills and experience to contribute to national development.
Conclusion:

The phenomenon of OFW migration presents a complex challenge for the Philippines. While remittances have played a vital role in supporting the economy, it is crucial to recognize the human cost associated with this reliance. The government must strive to create a more sustainable and equitable economic model that reduces the need for Filipinos to seek employment abroad. By investing in human capital, promoting job creation, and protecting the rights of OFWs, the Philippines can harness the potential of its human resources while ensuring the well-being of its citizens both at home and abroad.",1

86,Gemini1.5-flash,"The concept of federalism has long captivated the Philippine political landscape, promising a solution to decades-old regional disparities and the persistent clamor for greater autonomy. However, the path towards a federal Philippines is fraught with challenges, raising critical questions about its feasibility, potential benefits, and potential pitfalls.

The Allure of Federalism:

Proponents of federalism argue that it offers several potential advantages:

Regional Autonomy: By devolving power to regional governments, federalism aims to empower local communities to address their unique needs and concerns more effectively. This could lead to more responsive and efficient governance, tailored to the specific realities of different regions.
Economic Development: Decentralized governance could unlock the economic potential of regions by allowing them to leverage their own resources and attract investments more effectively.
Peace and Order: In regions plagued by insurgency and conflict, such as Mindanao, federalism is seen as a potential pathway to lasting peace and reconciliation by granting greater autonomy to marginalized groups.
Reduced Centralization: Federalism aims to break the stranglehold of centralized power in Manila, fostering a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities across the archipelago.
The Roadblocks and Concerns:

However, the path towards a federal Philippines is fraught with significant challenges:

Economic Viability: Concerns have been raised about the economic viability of smaller, more autonomous regions. Some fear that smaller units may lack the resources and capacity to effectively govern themselves and provide essential services to their citizens.
Social and Political Divisions: The creation of new political units could exacerbate existing social and political divisions, potentially leading to increased regionalism and even secessionist movements.
Risk of Fragmentation: Critics argue that federalism could lead to the fragmentation of the nation, weakening national unity and undermining the country's capacity to address national challenges.
Constitutional Amendments: Shifting to a federal system would require significant constitutional amendments, a complex and politically challenging process that could face strong opposition from various stakeholders.
The Way Forward:

Moving forward, a thorough and inclusive national dialogue is crucial to address the concerns and complexities surrounding federalism. This dialogue should involve a wide range of stakeholders, including local government officials, civil society organizations, academic experts, and ordinary citizens.

Key considerations for a successful transition to federalism include:

Clear and Comprehensive Framework: Developing a clear and comprehensive framework for federalism that addresses the concerns of all stakeholders.
Economic Viability and Sustainability: Ensuring the economic viability and sustainability of federal units through mechanisms for fiscal equalization and intergovernmental cooperation.
Addressing Social and Political Divisions: Promoting social cohesion and mitigating potential risks of fragmentation through mechanisms for inter-regional cooperation and conflict resolution.
Protecting Human Rights: Ensuring that the rights of all citizens, including minorities and marginalized groups, are fully protected under a federal system.
Gradual and Phased Approach: Implementing federalism through a gradual and phased approach, allowing for adjustments and refinements based on experience and feedback.
Conclusion:

Federalism in the Philippines presents both a promise and a peril. While it offers the potential for greater autonomy, economic development, and peace and order, it also carries significant risks, including economic instability, social fragmentation, and political upheaval.

The success of federalism hinges on careful planning, thorough consultation, and a commitment to addressing the concerns of all stakeholders.

87,Gemini1.5-flash,"The health of a democracy hinges on the integrity of its electoral processes. In the Philippines, the interplay between campaign finance, transparency, and the overall democratic experience is a complex and often contentious issue. While laws exist to regulate campaign spending and ensure transparency, significant challenges remain, hindering the realization of a truly level playing field and undermining public trust in government.

The Ideal: Fair Elections and Informed Voters

In a truly democratic system, elections should be contests of ideas, not of wealth. Campaign finance regulations aim to level the playing field, ensuring that candidates with merit and popular support, not just deep pockets, have a fair chance to compete. Transparency in campaign finance is crucial for several reasons:

Informed Voter Choice: When voters have access to information about the sources of campaign funding, they can make more informed decisions. They can assess whether candidates are beholden to special interests or truly represent the will of the people.
Reduced Corruption: Transparent campaign finance helps to deter corruption by making it more difficult for candidates to engage in illicit activities such as money laundering, bribery, and the use of undisclosed funds.
Increased Public Trust: When citizens can see how political campaigns are funded and how politicians are spending public money, they are more likely to trust that their government is acting in their best interests.
Promoting Accountability: Transparency in campaign finance allows for greater public scrutiny of political activities. Citizens and civil society organizations can monitor campaign spending, identify potential conflicts of interest, and hold politicians accountable for their actions.
The Reality: Challenges and Loopholes

Despite the existence of laws regulating campaign finance, significant challenges remain in achieving true transparency and accountability in Philippine elections:

Weak Enforcement: Weak enforcement of existing laws allows for widespread circumvention of regulations. Loopholes in the law are exploited, and penalties for violations are often inadequate or rarely enforced.
Lack of Political Will: There is often a lack of political will to effectively enforce campaign finance laws, particularly when powerful politicians are implicated.
Limited Resources: Understaffed and underfunded election authorities struggle to effectively monitor campaign spending and investigate potential violations.
Opaque Sources of Funding: Many sources of campaign funding remain opaque, making it difficult to track the true origins of campaign funds.
Rise of ""Dark Money"": The rise of ""dark money"" – contributions from undisclosed sources – poses a significant challenge to campaign finance transparency.
The Impact on Democracy:

The lack of transparency in campaign finance has serious implications for Philippine democracy:

Erosion of Public Trust: The perception of corruption and undue influence in politics erodes public trust in government institutions and undermines the legitimacy of the electoral process.
Unequal Playing Field: Wealthy candidates and those with access to significant financial resources enjoy an unfair advantage, hindering the participation of ordinary citizens in the political process.
Distorted Policy-Making: The influence of large donors can distort the political process, leading to policies that favor the interests of wealthy elites rather than the needs of the general public.
Increased Vulnerability to Corruption: Lack of transparency creates opportunities for corruption, such as bribery, extortion, and the misuse of public funds.
Towards a More Transparent and Accountable System:

To strengthen the integrity of the electoral process and enhance public trust, several key steps are crucial:

Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms: Enhancing the capacity of election authorities to investigate and prosecute violations of campaign finance laws.
Closing Loopholes in the Law: Revising and strengthening campaign finance laws to close loopholes and address emerging challenges, such as the rise of ""dark money.""
Improving Data Accessibility: Making campaign finance data more accessible to the public through online platforms and user-friendly formats.
Promoting Public Awareness: Conducting public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities in relation to campaign finance.
Encouraging Civil Society Engagement: Encouraging the active participation of civil society organizations in monitoring campaign finance and advocating for electoral reforms.

88,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, a nation known for its resilience and vibrant culture, grapples with a significant yet often unspoken challenge: the pervasive stigma surrounding mental health. This stigma, deeply rooted in cultural values and societal misconceptions, hinders individuals from seeking help, perpetuates discrimination, and ultimately undermines the nation's overall well-being.   

A Culture of Silence:

Filipino culture places a strong emphasis on ""hiya"" (shame) and ""pakikisama"" (conformity), often leading individuals to internalize their struggles and avoid seeking help for fear of social disapproval. Mental health issues are frequently viewed as personal weaknesses, family disgraces, or even signs of ""kabaliwan"" (insanity), leading to fear, isolation, and discrimination.   

This stigma manifests in various ways:

Fear of Judgment: Individuals fear being labeled as ""weak,"" ""crazy,"" or ""attention-seeking"" if they disclose their mental health struggles. This fear prevents them from seeking professional help, leading to delayed treatment and worsening conditions.   
Family Pressure: Family members may pressure individuals to ""toughen up"" or ""pray it away,"" discouraging them from seeking professional mental health care.   
Lack of Understanding: Misconceptions about mental illness, such as the belief that it is solely a matter of willpower, further perpetuate stigma and hinder public understanding.
Discrimination: Individuals with mental health conditions may face discrimination in employment, education, and social settings, further exacerbating their isolation and hindering their recovery.

91,Copilot,"Income inequality remains a significant challenge in the Philippines, despite the country's notable economic growth over the past few decades. This editorial explores the causes, effects, and potential solutions to this pressing issue.

The State of Income Inequality
The Philippines has made substantial progress in reducing poverty, with the poverty rate falling from 49.2% in 1985 to 16.7% in 20181. However, income inequality remains high. The top 1% of earners capture 17% of the national income, while the bottom 50% share only 14%1. The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, was 42.3% in 2018, one of the highest in East Asia1.

Causes of Income Inequality
Several factors contribute to income inequality in the Philippines:

Educational Disparities: Access to quality education is uneven, with children from wealthier families having better opportunities to attend good schools and universities. This disparity leads to unequal job opportunities and income levels2.

Urban-Rural Divide: Economic development has been concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural regions behind. This urban-rural divide exacerbates income inequality as rural residents often have limited access to high-paying jobs and essential services3.

Political Culture: The political system in the Philippines often favors the elite, with policies and resources disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. This ""spoils system"" perpetuates inequality by maintaining the status quo4.

Labor Market Inefficiencies: Many workers are employed in low-paying, informal jobs with little job security or benefits. This situation is particularly prevalent in the agricultural sector, where a significant portion of the population is employed5.

Effects of Income Inequality
Income inequality has far-reaching consequences for the Philippines:

Economic Instability: High levels of inequality can lead to economic instability. When a large portion of the population has limited purchasing power, it can stifle economic growth and lead to social unrest2.

Social Progress: Inequality hampers social progress by limiting access to education, healthcare, and other essential services for the poor. This perpetuates a cycle of poverty and reduces social mobility2.

Health and Nutrition: Inequality affects health outcomes, with poorer households experiencing higher rates of malnutrition, stunting, and other health issues. This disparity can have long-term effects on the country's human capital2.

Intergenerational Poverty: Income inequality perpetuates intergenerational poverty, as children from low-income families have fewer opportunities to improve their socio-economic status2.

Potential Solutions
Addressing income inequality in the Philippines requires a multifaceted approach:

Improving Education Access and Quality: Expanding access to quality education, particularly in rural areas, is crucial. This includes investing in schools, training teachers, and providing scholarships for low-income students1.

Strengthening Social Protection: Expanding social protection programs, such as conditional cash transfers and unemployment benefits, can provide a safety net for the poor and reduce income inequality1.

Labor Market Reforms: Implementing labor market reforms to improve job security, increase wages, and provide benefits for informal workers can help reduce inequality5.

Political Reforms: Addressing the political culture that favors the elite is essential. This includes promoting transparency, reducing corruption, and ensuring that policies benefit all citizens, not just the wealthy4.

Conclusion
Income inequality in the Philippines is a complex issue with deep-rooted causes and significant effects on the country's socio-economic landscape. While progress has been made in reducing poverty, much work remains to be done to address inequality. By implementing comprehensive policies that improve education, promote rural development, strengthen social protection, reform the labor market, and address political inequalities, the Philippines can move towards a more equitable and prosperous future.",1
92,Copilot,"Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) have long been hailed as the modern-day heroes of the Philippines. Their contributions to the economy through remittances, as well as the social and cultural impacts of their work abroad, are profound. This editorial delves into the significance of OFWs, the challenges they face, and the policies that support them.

The Economic Impact of OFWs
OFWs play a crucial role in the Philippine economy. In 2022, remittances from OFWs reached a record high of $36.14 billion, accounting for approximately 9% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)1. These remittances are vital for many Filipino families, providing a stable source of income that supports household consumption, education, healthcare, and other essential needs.

The inflow of remittances also bolsters the country's foreign exchange reserves, helping to stabilize the Philippine peso and reduce the trade deficit2. This financial support is particularly important during economic downturns, as it provides a buffer against external shocks and helps maintain economic stability.

Social and Cultural Contributions
Beyond their economic impact, OFWs contribute significantly to the social and cultural fabric of the Philippines. They are often seen as symbols of resilience and sacrifice, enduring homesickness and challenging working conditions to provide for their families. This sense of duty and commitment has earned them the title of ""Bagong Bayani"" or ""New Heroes""1.

The remittances sent by OFWs are often used to improve the quality of life for their families, funding education, healthcare, and housing. This, in turn, helps to uplift entire communities and contributes to social development. Moreover, the skills and experiences gained by OFWs abroad can be valuable assets when they return to the Philippines, potentially leading to new business ventures and job creation3.

Challenges Faced by OFWs
Despite their significant contributions, OFWs face numerous challenges. Many work in low-status jobs with limited protections, making them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse1. Female OFWs, who make up a significant portion of the overseas workforce, are particularly at risk of gender-based discrimination and violence1.

The separation from their families also takes a toll on the mental and emotional well-being of OFWs and their loved ones. Children of OFWs often grow up without one or both parents, leading to potential social and psychological issues4.

Government Policies and Support
The Philippine government has implemented various policies and programs to support OFWs and protect their rights. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) regulates the deployment of Filipino workers abroad and ensures that they are provided with fair and safe working conditions4. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) offers welfare programs, including insurance, legal assistance, and repatriation services4.

Additionally, the government has established bilateral labor agreements with several countries to safeguard the rights of Filipino workers and ensure their well-being5. These agreements are crucial in addressing issues such as contract violations, non-payment of wages, and other forms of maltreatment.

Potential Solutions and Future Outlook
To further support OFWs and maximize their contributions to the economy, several measures can be taken:

Strengthening Legal Protections: Enhancing the enforcement of labor laws and bilateral agreements can help protect OFWs from exploitation and abuse. This includes providing legal assistance and support for those who face injustices abroad5.

Promoting Financial Literacy: Educating OFWs and their families about financial management can help them make better use of remittances, leading to long-term financial stability and investment in productive ventures2.

Encouraging Return Migration: Creating opportunities for OFWs to return and reintegrate into the local economy can harness their skills and experiences for national development. This includes offering incentives for entrepreneurship and job creation3.

Improving Social Services: Enhancing access to social services such as education, healthcare, and housing for the families of OFWs can mitigate the negative impacts of family separation and improve overall well-being4.

Conclusion
Overseas Filipino Workers are indispensable to the Philippine economy and society. Their remittances provide a lifeline for millions of families and contribute significantly to national economic stability. However, the challenges they face highlight the need for continued support and protection from the government and society. By addressing these challenges and implementing supportive policies, the Philippines can ensure that the contributions of OFWs are fully realized, leading to a more prosperous and equitable future for all.",1

The Demographic Power of Youth
The Philippines is a youthful nation. As of 2022, more than half of the country's 65.7 million registered voters were between the ages of 18 and 411. This demographic power means that the youth have a substantial say in the outcome of elections and the direction of the country's political future. Their sheer numbers make them a critical constituency that politicians cannot afford to ignore.

Youth Engagement in Politics
Youth engagement in politics takes many forms, from voting and campaigning to activism and policy advocacy. The 2022 national elections saw a significant increase in youth participation, with many young Filipinos registering to vote for the first time1. This surge in political engagement was driven by a desire for change and a recognition of the power of their collective voice.

Social media has played a pivotal role in mobilizing the youth. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become arenas for political discourse, where young people share information, debate issues, and organize movements2. The digital landscape has democratized political participation, allowing even those in remote areas to engage in national conversations.

Challenges Faced by Youth in Politics
Despite their potential, Filipino youth face several challenges in the political arena:

Political Dynasties: The prevalence of political dynasties in the Philippines often stifles new voices and ideas. Young candidates without family connections or significant financial backing find it difficult to compete against established political families3.

Misinformation and Fake News: The spread of misinformation and fake news on social media platforms poses a significant challenge. Young voters, who are highly active online, are particularly vulnerable to misleading information, which can influence their political choices1.

Economic Barriers: Economic challenges also hinder youth participation in politics. Many young Filipinos are preoccupied with securing their livelihoods, leaving little time or resources for political engagement3.

96,Copilot,"The concept of federalism has been a recurring theme in the political discourse of the Philippines for over a century. Advocates argue that a federal system could address the country's longstanding issues of regional inequality, inefficiency in governance, and the concentration of power in ""imperial Manila."" This editorial explores the history, arguments for and against federalism, and its potential impact on the Philippines.

Historical Context
The idea of federalism in the Philippines dates back to the late 19th century. Filipino revolutionary leaders like Emilio Aguinaldo and Apolinario Mabini envisioned a federal structure that would divide the country into three states: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao1. This vision was rooted in the desire to create a more balanced and representative government that could address the diverse needs of the archipelago.

In the modern era, federalism gained renewed attention during the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, who campaigned on a platform that included the promise of shifting to a federal system2. Duterte's push for federalism was driven by the belief that decentralization could promote regional development and address the grievances of marginalized areas, particularly in Mindanao2.

Arguments for Federalism
Proponents of federalism in the Philippines present several compelling arguments:

Decentralization of Power: Federalism would distribute power more evenly across the country, reducing the dominance of Metro Manila. This decentralization could lead to more responsive and accountable local governments1.

Economic Development: By granting regions greater control over their resources and policies, federalism could spur economic development in underdeveloped areas. Local governments would have the autonomy to tailor economic strategies to their specific needs3.

Addressing Regional Inequality: Federalism could help bridge the gap between wealthy and poor regions. By empowering local governments, it could ensure a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities3.

Cultural and Ethnic Representation: The Philippines is home to diverse cultural and ethnic groups. A federal system could provide better representation and autonomy for these groups, fostering a sense of inclusion and reducing regional tensions2.

Improved Governance: Decentralized governance could lead to more efficient and effective public services. Local governments, being closer to the people, could respond more swiftly to their needs and concerns3.

Arguments Against Federalism
Despite its potential benefits, federalism also faces significant opposition and challenges:

Risk of Fragmentation: Critics argue that federalism could lead to the fragmentation of the country. The creation of autonomous regions might encourage separatist movements and weaken national unity4.

Economic Disparities: There is a concern that federalism could exacerbate economic disparities between regions. Wealthier regions might thrive, while poorer ones could struggle without sufficient support from the central government4.

Implementation Challenges: Transitioning to a federal system would require significant constitutional changes and a comprehensive overhaul of existing institutions. This process could be complex, costly, and time-consuming4.

Political Dynasties: Federalism might entrench political dynasties at the regional level. Local elites could consolidate power, leading to corruption and patronage politics4.

Lack of Preparedness: Some argue that the Philippines is not yet ready for federalism. The country needs to strengthen its institutions and governance mechanisms before undertaking such a radical shift4.

Potential Impact on Governance and Society
If implemented effectively, federalism could have a transformative impact on the Philippines:

Enhanced Local Governance: Federalism could empower local governments to address their unique challenges and opportunities. This could lead to more innovative and context-specific solutions to local issues3.

Economic Growth: By promoting regional development, federalism could stimulate economic growth across the country. Regions would have the autonomy to attract investments, develop infrastructure, and create jobs3.

Social Cohesion: Federalism could foster a sense of belonging and representation among diverse cultural and ethnic groups. This inclusivity could strengthen social cohesion and reduce regional conflicts2.

Political Accountability: Decentralized governance could enhance political accountability. Local leaders would be more directly accountable to their constituents, leading to better governance and reduced corruption3.

National Unity: While there are concerns about fragmentation, a well-designed federal system could actually strengthen national unity by addressing regional grievances and promoting a more balanced distribution of power2.

Conclusion
The debate over federalism in the Philippines is complex and multifaceted. While it offers the promise of decentralization, regional development, and improved governance, it also poses significant risks and challenges. The success of federalism would depend on careful planning, robust institutions, and a commitment to equitable development.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt federalism should be guided by a thorough and inclusive dialogue that considers the diverse perspectives and needs of all Filipinos. By addressing the root causes of regional inequality and fostering a more inclusive political system, the Philippines can move towards a more prosperous and united future.",1
97,Copilot,"Election campaign finance transparency is a cornerstone of democratic integrity. In the Philippines, where elections are a vibrant and essential part of the political landscape, ensuring transparency in campaign finance is crucial to maintaining public trust and preventing corruption. This editorial explores the current state of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, the challenges faced, and potential solutions to enhance accountability.

The Legal Framework
The Philippines has established a legal framework to promote transparency in election campaign finance. Key laws and regulations include:

Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881): This code requires every candidate and political party treasurer to submit a full, true, and itemized statement of all contributions and expenditures related to the election1.

Republic Act No. 7166: This act provides for synchronized national and local elections and elaborates on the deadlines, required contents, and significance of submitting the Statement of Contributions and Expenses (SOCE). It also prescribes penalties for non-compliance1.

COMELEC Resolutions: The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) issues resolutions before each election cycle to set specific guidelines for the submission of the SOCE, detailing requirements such as formats, additional information, and deadlines1.

These regulations aim to ensure that all financial activities related to election campaigns are disclosed, promoting transparency and accountability.

The Role of the SOCE
The SOCE is a critical component of Philippine election law. It requires candidates, political parties, and contributors to disclose their financial activities related to the election campaign. The SOCE must include:

Contributions: A detailed listing of all contributions received, including cash contributions, in-kind donations (e.g., services, goods, property), and any other forms of support. The source of each contribution must be clearly stated, specifying the name of the donor, their address, and the amount/value of the contribution1.
Expenditures: All campaign-related expenditures must be itemized, including expenses for advertisements, rallies, staff, equipment, and transportation. The expenditures must comply with the limitations and prohibitions set forth under election law1.
Disclosure of Unspent Contributions: Any unused contributions must also be declared. Under the law, such amounts should be returned to the donors or turned over to the national treasury if donors are not identifiable1.
Challenges to Transparency
Despite the legal framework, several challenges hinder the effective implementation of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines:

Weak Enforcement: The enforcement of campaign finance laws is often weak. COMELEC, the body responsible for overseeing elections, faces resource constraints and lacks the capacity to thoroughly audit all SOCE submissions2.

Political Dynasties and Influence: The prevalence of political dynasties and the influence of wealthy individuals and corporations can undermine transparency efforts. These entities often have the resources to circumvent regulations and exert undue influence on the electoral process2.

Misinformation and Lack of Awareness: Many candidates and contributors are either unaware of the requirements or deliberately choose to ignore them. This lack of awareness and the spread of misinformation can lead to non-compliance2.

Inconsistent Reporting: The quality and consistency of SOCE submissions vary widely. Some candidates provide detailed and accurate reports, while others submit incomplete or misleading information2.

Potential Solutions
To enhance campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, several measures can be taken:

Strengthening Enforcement: COMELEC should be provided with adequate resources and authority to enforce campaign finance laws effectively. This includes increasing its capacity to audit SOCE submissions and imposing stricter penalties for non-compliance2.

Promoting Public Awareness: Educating candidates, political parties, and the public about the importance of campaign finance transparency is crucial. Public awareness campaigns can help ensure that all stakeholders understand their responsibilities and the consequences of non-compliance2.

Leveraging Technology: Implementing digital platforms for the submission and auditing of SOCEs can improve efficiency and accuracy. Online systems can facilitate real-time monitoring and make it easier for COMELEC to identify discrepancies2.

Encouraging Civil Society Participation: Civil society organizations can play a vital role in promoting transparency. By monitoring campaign finance activities and advocating for reforms, these organizations can help hold candidates and political parties accountable2.

Enhancing Legal Provisions: Revising and updating campaign finance laws to address current challenges and loopholes is essential. This includes setting clearer guidelines for contributions and expenditures and ensuring that all financial activities are transparently reported2.

Conclusion
Transparency in election campaign finance is fundamental to the integrity of the democratic process in the Philippines. While the country has established a robust legal framework, challenges remain in ensuring effective implementation and compliance. By strengthening enforcement, promoting public awareness, leveraging technology, encouraging civil society participation, and enhancing legal provisions, the Philippines can move towards a more transparent and accountable electoral system. Ensuring that all financial activities related to election campaigns are disclosed and scrutinized is not only a legal requirement but also a moral imperative to uphold the principles of democracy and good governance.",1
98,Copilot,"Mental health stigma remains a significant barrier to well-being in the Philippines. Despite recent progress, many Filipinos still face prejudice and misunderstanding when it comes to mental health issues. This editorial explores the roots of mental health stigma in the Philippines, its impact on individuals and society, and the steps needed to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment.

The Roots of Mental Health Stigma
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is deeply rooted in cultural, religious, and historical contexts. Several factors contribute to this pervasive issue:

Cultural Values: Filipino culture places a high value on resilience and endurance. The concept of ""hiya"" (shame) and ""pakikisama"" (the need to conform and maintain social harmony) often discourages individuals from openly discussing their mental health struggles1. Admitting to mental health issues is sometimes seen as a sign of weakness or a personal failing.

Religious Beliefs: In a predominantly Catholic country, mental health issues are sometimes attributed to a lack of faith or divine punishment1. This belief can lead individuals to seek spiritual rather than medical solutions, delaying or avoiding professional help.

Lack of Public Health Education: There is a widespread lack of understanding about mental health conditions. Terms like ""baliw"" (crazy) are often used indiscriminately to describe a range of mental health issues, reflecting a lack of nuanced understanding2. This ignorance perpetuates stereotypes and misconceptions.

The Impact of Stigma
The stigma surrounding mental health has far-reaching consequences for individuals and society:

Delayed Treatment: Many Filipinos delay seeking help due to fear of judgment and discrimination1. This can lead to the worsening of mental health conditions and increased risk of suicide. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 3.3 million Filipinos live with depression, yet many do not receive the care they need1.

Discrimination: Stigma leads to discrimination in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and social interactions1. Individuals with mental health conditions may face exclusion and prejudice, further exacerbating their struggles.

Economic Burden: Untreated mental health issues can result in decreased productivity and increased healthcare costs1. The economic impact of mental health stigma is significant, affecting not only individuals but also the broader economy.

Social Isolation: Stigma can lead to social isolation, as individuals may withdraw from their communities to avoid judgment1. This isolation can worsen mental health conditions and hinder recovery.

Steps Towards Change
Addressing mental health stigma in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach:

Education and Awareness: Increasing public awareness about mental health is crucial. Educational campaigns can help dispel myths and misconceptions, promoting a more accurate understanding of mental health conditions1. Schools, workplaces, and community organizations should be involved in these efforts.

Legislation and Policy: The passage of the Mental Health Act of 2018 was a significant milestone2. This law aims to provide accessible and affordable mental health services, integrate mental health education into schools, and raise public awareness. Continued support for such legislation is essential to ensure its effective implementation.

Accessible Mental Health Services: Expanding access to mental health services is vital. This includes increasing the number of mental health professionals, improving facilities, and ensuring that services are available in both urban and rural areas1. Telehealth services can also play a role in reaching underserved populations.

Community Support: Building supportive communities is key to reducing stigma. Community-based programs that provide safe spaces for individuals to discuss their mental health can foster understanding and acceptance1. Peer support groups and mental health advocates can also play a crucial role.

Media Representation: The media has a powerful influence on public perceptions. Promoting accurate and compassionate portrayals of mental health in the media can help challenge stereotypes and reduce stigma1. Influential personalities sharing their mental health journeys can also normalize conversations around this topic.

Encouraging Open Dialogue: Creating an environment where people feel comfortable discussing their mental health is essential. Encouraging open dialogue within families, schools, and workplaces can help break down barriers and promote a culture of acceptance1.

Conclusion
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is a complex issue that requires concerted efforts from all sectors of society. By addressing the cultural, religious, and educational roots of stigma, and by promoting awareness, legislation, and community support, the Philippines can move towards a more inclusive and supportive environment for individuals with mental health conditions. Breaking the silence and fostering open conversations about mental health is not only a matter of individual well-being but also a crucial step towards a healthier and more equitable society.",1
99,Copilot,"Urban congestion and housing shortages are two of the most pressing issues facing the Philippines today. As the country continues to urbanize rapidly, these challenges have significant implications for economic growth, social equity, and overall quality of life. This editorial explores the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to these intertwined problems.

The State of Urban Congestion
Urban congestion, particularly in Metro Manila, is a daily reality for millions of Filipinos. According to the 2023 TomTom Traffic Index, Metro Manila has the longest average travel time to traverse a 10-kilometer route among 387 cities worldwide, taking an average of 25 minutes and 30 seconds1. This congestion results in significant economic losses, estimated at around $4 billion annually due to lost productivity2.

Several factors contribute to this severe congestion:

High Population Density: Metro Manila is one of the most densely populated urban areas globally, with over 13 million residents2. The high population density exacerbates traffic congestion as more people rely on the same limited road infrastructure.

Inadequate Public Transportation: The public transportation system in Metro Manila is often overcrowded and inefficient. Many residents resort to using private vehicles, which occupy more road space and contribute to traffic jams3.

Urban Planning Issues: The city's layout and infrastructure have not kept pace with its rapid growth. Poor urban planning has led to bottlenecks and inefficient traffic flow4.

Economic Activity Concentration: Major business districts and shopping centers are concentrated along key routes like EDSA, further increasing traffic volume in these areas4.

The State of Housing Shortages
The Philippines faces a severe housing crisis, with a backlog of approximately 6.5 million homes5. This shortage is particularly acute in urban areas, where rapid population growth and urbanization have outpaced the supply of affordable housing.

Key factors contributing to the housing shortage include:

Rapid Urbanization: As more Filipinos move to cities in search of better opportunities, the demand for housing has surged. Urban centers like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao are struggling to accommodate this influx5.

High Land Costs: The cost of land in urban areas is prohibitively high, making it difficult for low-income families to afford housing. This has led to the proliferation of informal settlements5.

Inadequate Housing Policies: Despite various government initiatives, the implementation of housing policies has been inconsistent. Bureaucratic hurdles and slow permitting processes have hindered the development of affordable housing5.

Economic Inequality: The disparity in income levels means that many Filipinos cannot afford decent housing. This inequality is reflected in the high number of informal settlers living in substandard conditions5.

Impacts of Urban Congestion and Housing Shortages
The impacts of urban congestion and housing shortages are far-reaching:

Economic Costs: Traffic congestion leads to lost productivity and increased transportation costs. It also affects the delivery of goods and services, impacting businesses and the economy2.

Health and Well-being: Prolonged exposure to traffic pollution can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. Additionally, the stress of long commutes affects mental health and overall well-being2.

Social Inequality: Housing shortages exacerbate social inequality, as low-income families are forced to live in informal settlements with inadequate access to basic services like clean water, sanitation, and electricity5.

Environmental Degradation: Urban sprawl and the lack of green spaces contribute to environmental degradation. Informal settlements often encroach on environmentally sensitive areas, leading to deforestation and pollution5.

Potential Solutions
Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multi-faceted approach:

Improving Public Transportation: Investing in efficient and reliable public transportation systems is crucial. Expanding the existing train networks, implementing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, and improving the quality of buses and jeepneys can reduce the reliance on private vehicles2.

Smart Urban Planning: Adopting smart urban planning practices can help alleviate congestion. This includes creating mixed-use developments that reduce the need for long commutes, implementing zoning laws that promote balanced development, and improving traffic management systems3.

Affordable Housing Initiatives: Increasing the supply of affordable housing is essential. Public-private partnerships can leverage funding for housing projects, while government incentives can encourage private developers to invest in low-cost housing5. Innovative solutions like modular homes and sustainable building materials can also help address the housing shortage6.

Strengthening Housing Policies: Streamlining the permitting process and reducing bureaucratic hurdles can accelerate the development of affordable housing. Ensuring that housing policies are effectively implemented and monitored is crucial5.

Community Involvement: Engaging communities in the planning and development process can lead to more sustainable and inclusive solutions. Community-led initiatives, such as cooperative housing projects and local infrastructure improvements, can empower residents and address their specific needs5.

Environmental Sustainability: Promoting environmentally sustainable practices in urban development can mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization. This includes incorporating green spaces, promoting energy-efficient buildings, and implementing waste management systems7.

Conclusion
Urban congestion and housing shortages are complex challenges that require coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and civil society. By investing in public transportation, adopting smart urban planning practices, increasing the supply of affordable housing, and promoting community involvement, the Philippines can address these issues and improve the quality of life for its citizens. Ensuring that urban development is sustainable and inclusive is not only a matter of necessity but also a crucial step towards a more equitable and prosperous future.",1
100,Copilot,"Plastic pollution is a critical environmental issue in the Philippines, posing severe threats to marine ecosystems, public health, and the economy. As one of the world's top contributors to ocean plastic waste, the Philippines faces an urgent need to address this growing crisis. This editorial examines the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to plastic pollution in the Philippines.

The Scale of the Problem
The Philippines generates approximately 2.7 million metric tons of plastic waste annually, with a significant portion ending up in the ocean1. A study by Ocean Conservancy and McKinsey identified the Philippines as the third-largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution globally1. This alarming statistic underscores the magnitude of the problem and the urgent need for effective interventions.

Causes of Plastic Pollution
Several factors contribute to the severe plastic pollution problem in the Philippines:

Single-Use Plastics: The widespread use of single-use plastics, such as sachets, bags, and bottles, is a major contributor to plastic waste. These items are often discarded after a single use, leading to significant environmental pollution2.

Inadequate Waste Management: The country's waste management infrastructure is insufficient to handle the volume of plastic waste generated. Only about 33% of waste is properly managed, with the rest ending up in landfills, rivers, and oceans3. The lack of sanitary landfills and proper waste disposal facilities exacerbates the problem4.

Urban Runoff and Improper Disposal: Urban runoff and improper waste disposal practices contribute to the leakage of plastic waste into waterways. In metropolitan areas like Manila, waste management systems are often overwhelmed, leading to significant plastic pollution3.

Economic and Cultural Factors: The ""tingi-tingi"" culture, where products are sold in small, disposable packaging, is prevalent due to economic constraints. This practice results in a high volume of plastic waste5.

Impacts of Plastic Pollution
The impacts of plastic pollution in the Philippines are far-reaching and multifaceted:

Environmental Damage: Plastic pollution poses a dire threat to marine ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion, starvation, and death3. Additionally, plastic waste damages coral reefs and mangrove forests, which are critical for coastal protection and marine biodiversity3.

Public Health Risks: The improper disposal of plastics can lead to the leaching of toxic chemicals into the soil and water, posing health risks to communities5. Microplastics, which are small plastic particles, can enter the food chain and potentially impact human health.

Economic Costs: Plastic pollution affects industries such as fishing and tourism, which are vital to the Philippine economy. The presence of plastic waste in coastal areas can lead to reduced fish stocks and a decline in tourism, resulting in economic losses for local communities5.

Social Inequality: Coastal communities, which often rely on fishing and tourism for their livelihoods, are disproportionately affected by plastic pollution. These communities face economic and health challenges due to the presence of plastic waste in their environment3.

Potential Solutions
Addressing plastic pollution in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach:

Policy Reforms: Strengthening regulations on single-use plastics and implementing incentives for businesses to adopt sustainable packaging alternatives are crucial steps. The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Act, which holds manufacturers accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, is a significant policy initiative6. This law requires businesses to manage the waste generated by their products, promoting sustainable practices.

Improving Waste Management: Enhancing waste management infrastructure is essential to reduce plastic pollution. This includes increasing the number of sanitary landfills, improving waste collection systems, and promoting recycling and materials sustainability6. Local government units (LGUs) play a critical role in managing waste at the municipal level.

Promoting a Circular Economy: Transitioning to a circular economy, where products are designed for reuse, recycling, and minimal waste, can significantly reduce plastic pollution7. This approach involves redesigning products and packaging to minimize waste and encouraging the use of biodegradable materials.

Community Engagement and Education: Raising awareness about the impacts of plastic pollution and promoting community involvement in waste management initiatives are vital. Educational campaigns can help change public attitudes towards plastic use and encourage more sustainable behaviors3.

Clean-Up Initiatives: Organizing clean-up drives and community-based waste collection programs can help remove plastic waste from the environment. These initiatives also raise awareness and foster a sense of responsibility among citizens3.

International Collaboration: Addressing plastic pollution requires global cooperation. The Philippines can benefit from sharing best practices and collaborating with other countries and international organizations to develop effective strategies for reducing plastic waste6.

Conclusion
Plastic pollution is a complex and pressing issue that demands immediate and sustained action. By implementing comprehensive policy reforms, improving waste management infrastructure, promoting a circular economy, and engaging communities, the Philippines can make significant strides in addressing this environmental crisis. Ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment is not only essential for the well-being of current and future generations but also crucial for the country's economic and social development. The fight against plastic pollution is a collective responsibility that requires the commitment and cooperation of all sectors of society.",1
101,John Nery,"As it turns out, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno isn’t really with the opposition. The premise of the Sambayan convenor process was the search for a unifying presidential candidate who would oppose Dutertismo and its awful, consequential changes. My own summary of these changes include the so-called war on drugs, which has led to thousands of extrajudicial killings; the pivot to China, which has created an unpatriotic presidency subservient to Beijing; and the continuing rehabilitation of the Marcoses. To those opposed to the Duterte regime, the evidence for these changes is already established, the fact-finding already painstakingly done. After all, the Duterte presidency is already past its fifth year.

To hear Moreno speak after he announced his presidential candidacy, however, the existence of these changes, and especially their consequences, remain matters to be investigated. That betrays his political colors: If he were truly in the opposition, he would welcome the decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Court to formally investigate President Duterte for crimes against humanity. If he were truly in the opposition, he would criticize the President’s subcontracting his foreign policy to Beijing, and would not offer such a non-patriot a seat in his Cabinet. And if he were truly in the opposition, he would not pretend that his friends, the Marcoses, were somehow the victims who have been prevented all these years from adequately explaining their “side.”

Why did the Sambayan convenors include Moreno, whose real last name is Domagoso, in their list of candidates? I can hazard a couple of guesses: First, the mayor’s increasingly pointed criticism of the national government’s pandemic response made him a sympathetic figure. It didn’t hurt his image when he started criticizing the attempts to crown the President’s daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, as the heir apparent. Second, the convenors, or at least some of them, wanted the popular, charismatic ex-actor to BE opposition. In that sense, they were only reflecting the opinion of many.

Second, the convenors, or at least some of them, wanted the popular, charismatic ex-actor to BE opposition. In that sense, they were only reflecting the opinion of many.

But if anyone in the real opposition is still unclear about Moreno’s political positioning, just consider his view on the incarceration of Sen. Leila de Lima. He accepts the ostensibly objective view that the matter is now completely with the courts; if he were truly with the opposition, he would know, first, that her cases were politically motivated and that, second, he should rush to repair the injustice. Instead, we get pabulum:

“If … Senator Leila de Lima can avail such right, she should be given that kind of right.”
In talks I’ve given before different audiences, including diplomats, I classified three types of prospective presidential candidates for 2022: continuity candidates like Sara, change candidates like Vice President Leni Robredo, and career candidates like Sen. Manny Pacquiao. No real need to define the first two, but the third one requires an explanation. There are candidates like Pacquiao and former senator Bongbong Marcos who will regard 2022 as their best chance to become president; in other words, 2022 is a career opportunity.

As his last fight proved, Pacquiao is nearing the end of his illustrious career as a boxer. There can’t be too many big-ticket fights left. A clearheaded review of his lackluster, almost non-existent political career should lead to an inevitable conclusion: His chances of rising to higher office are dependent on his continuing boxing fame. Given that, and given that his money is still (largely) intact, it would make sense for him to run for president in 2022.

If Marcos runs for president next year, he would likely have the support of an incumbent president; if that support is total, it may be good for two or so million votes. He would be 65 next year, his father died at 72; the difference is about the length of a presidential term. Not the least of his considerations: Next year is the 50th anniversary of the declaration of martial law. What better way to seal his family’s rehabilitation than to be the commander in chief who presides over that anniversary? (For these reasons, I think Marcos will in fact run for president.)

In my classification scheme, I placed Moreno in all three categories. Some in the opposition believed that he was genuinely with the opposition; I do not know what they would say now, in light of Moreno’s (disastrous) pronouncements after the (impressive) rollout of his candidacy. But at least until last week, earnest arguments for including Moreno in the opposition could still be made.
I also argued that, at least until around July this year, Moreno was still among those favored by President Duterte, enough to be considered as a possible continuity candidate. Until July, the President had always expressed admiration for the mayor, at least since he slayed the political giant Erap Estrada in 2019. It was only after Moreno criticized Sara’s attempted coronation that the President started criticizing him in turn.

But Isko Moreno is also a “career” candidate. Having known both the thrill of celebrity as an actor and the pain of loss as a senatorial candidate (in 2016), and then scaled the heights of popularity as the go-getting mayor of Manila, Moreno, in my view, understands just how fickle political goodwill can be. If he defers running, there is no assurance that he will remain popular in 2028. Now is the time.

Precisely because he is running for the career opportunity that the presidency represents, he has been trying to appeal to all; it is remarkable how, since last week, he has refrained from using the tough language the current crisis needs. (Has he even been heard from on the Pharmally scandal?). But in extending the length of the fence he is sitting on, more people can see him for who he is: a fence sitter",0
102,John Nery,"Even after the assassination of opposition leader Ninoy Aquino, and especially his funeral procession, shattered the last remaining pretensions of the Marcos regime to genuine popular support, the anti-Marcos opposition wasn’t united. The focus on fighting the dictator’s regime was common to all—but that fight was not understood, or fought, on the same terms.

In May 1984, for instance, less than a year after the Aquino assassination, opposition forces were split on the issue of the first regular elections for the Batasan Pambansa, the parliamentary centerpiece of Marcos’ new constitutional order. Should the opposition field candidates even though the odds were long and the voting process was likely rigged? Cory Aquino campaigned on a pragmatic note: participation without illusion, she said. Some other opposition leaders, including one of the most formidable of them all, the “old man” Lorenzo Tañada, called for a boycott of the legislative elections. Among those who joined his campaign: Ninoy and Cory’s only son, Noynoy.

Even when the unexpected victory of opposition assemblymen, like Hilario Davide Jr. of Pusyon Bisaya of Cebu and Homobono Adaza of the Mindanao Alliance, resulted in the minority expanding its ranks to about a third of the Batasan, giving it a measure of legislative leverage for the first time, not everyone opposed to Marcos saw the electoral struggle as an effective means, or even a valid strategy, to fight the regime. In the 1986 Snap Election, when Marcos himself was on the ballot, National Democratic forces continued to boycott the electoral process—a fateful decision that led to consequential rethinking within the movement in the aftermath of Marcos’ ouster.

But even Cory’s place at the head of the opposition, as its standard bearer, was not assured. Doy Laurel was the leader of the traditional political opposition in the Philippines; he welcomed Ninoy back to the Philippines and, a few days later, Cory too, in his capacity as the opposition leader who stayed home. When Marcos announced that by the powers vested in him by his own constitution, he was calling an unscheduled election, Laurel believed that he had the legitimacy to contest the presidency on behalf of all the opposition.

In hindsight, his commitment to what was called the freedom struggle was genuine, his capacity to do the hard work of campaigning against an ailing dictator unquestionable. But to many of us filling the aisles and corridors of the so-called parliament of the streets, Laurel was marked by the fatal sign of compromise. He retained the sprawling and strategic province of Batangas as his political base even in the depths of military rule; surely, or so we thought, this could only have been by arrangement? We knew Marcos remained loyal to the memory of Laurel’s father, who was the Supreme Court justice who caused the young Marcos’ cinematic acquittal on a murder charge. That was (always) true, but that the province of Batangas was neglected during the Marcos years, precisely as punishment for Doy Laurel’s political preeminence, was also true.

It had to take Jaime Cardinal Sin, the archbishop of Manila, to convince Laurel in December 1985 to cede what he must have perceived as his responsibility to run for the presidency, to the widow of the man whose killing had eventually forced Marcos to reclaim a public mandate.

Even before the defection of Juan Ponce Enrile and Fidel Ramos, the opposition forces which eventually coalesced around Cory Aquino when she ran against Marcos in the snap election was already a Big Tent: It included the leaders Ninoy himself looked up to, such as Jose Diokno and Jovito Salonga, and representatives of new or reemerging forces Ninoy did not know about. It included human rights lawyers like Joker Arroyo and Rene Saguisag, and anti-Marcos firebrands like Nene Pimentel and Bobbit Sanchez, who advised Cory—but it also included the most influential members of the business community, personified in the charismatic and influential Jimmy Ongpin.

After Cory became president, the fault lines in the opposition triggered increasingly public movements and shocks. But on Feb. 7, 1986, the Marcosian date Marcos himself chose as the day of decision, many of the opposition forces learned to focus on the do-or-die election, and rallied around one standard. By stepping forward, Cory not only made the difference; she made the difference possible.

103,John Nery,"We need to be smart about surveys. I’ve heard people who work in marketing say they don’t believe in surveys because in all their life they’ve never been part of a survey’s random sample. This is basic innumeracy (how many possible sets of 1,800 respondents are there in a population of 110 million?) compounded by demographic ignorance (a marketing executive likely belongs to a sliver of the AB “class,” a random sample of which must be proportional to the actual size of that demographic class).

To be clear: Surveys are not determinative — at least until the second survey round of the 90-day campaign period. That means that it will be the survey cycle about four or five weeks into the national campaign period where we may find public opinion consolidating.

The 2016 elections are instructive: In September 2015, Grace Poe led with 26 percent, in November Rody Duterte with 38, in December Poe and Jojo Binay tied with 26 (with Duterte dropping dramatically to 20 percent because of his cursing of the most popular person in Philippine survey history, Pope Francis). In January 2016, Binay led with 31 percent, in February (just before the campaign period started), Binay remained at the lead with 29 percent, in early March, Poe regained the lead with 27, and then in late March (over a month into the campaign), Duterte was back at the top with 27 percent. He remained the Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey leader until Election Day.

While the trend lines in the 2010 campaign are somewhat different, because Noynoy Aquino was the beneficiary of a genuinely popular draft with his mother’s death in August 2009, his high numbers (much higher than everyone else’s) went steadily down until the campaign period started in earnest. The first survey conducted during the campaign showed Manny Villar only a few points away; but with the second survey, conducted in mid-March, Aquino began pulling away again from Villar, Joseph Estrada, and the others, this time for good.

I share the view that SWS and Pulse Asia are by and large accurate; it is political folly to ignore them. We should treat these two survey groups with proven track records the way President Arroyo treated them in her 2004 election: with great discipline, using their surveys to guide her campaign. (It wasn’t until she was fighting a legitimacy crisis in the wake of the “Hello, Garci” scandal that her otherwise professional officials started badmouthing surveys.)

For supporters of Manny Pacquiao, this means tracking his ability to drain votes from Sara Duterte among Mindanao’s 15 million or so voters (as of 2019). For Isko Moreno, it means keeping his Luzon base solid while increasing his support in the Visayas. For Leni Robredo, this means consolidating support in the Bicol region and in Western and possibly Central Visayas, while nursing a slow but steady growth in national numbers (the next threshold is 10 percent) with every survey.

Consider the dzRH survey, conducted in the last week of July. From the looks of it, this was a true scientific survey, with a professional polling organization doing the fieldwork. It reinforces the narrative of inevitability that the Duterte dynasty wants to tell the world: Some 25 percent of the voting population (one out of every four voters) will vote for Sara as president, while 15 percent (roughly one out of every six or seven voters) will support her father if he runs for the vice presidency.

The dzRH survey does not have the same track record as SWS or Pulse Asia, but if it is truly aboveboard, meeting the rigorous requirements of a real survey, then we can study it the way we study the June 2021 Pulse Asia survey — which has the same top line.
Mindful of the difference in actual polling methods used, we cannot directly compare and contrast the dzRH survey of July with the Pulse Asia poll of June. And yet it is still also instructive to read the surveys as snapshots in a series of snapshots taken of the voting landscape. Then it is possible to discern not only current positions, but also possible movements.

At this point, both types of presidential mandates still seem possible: the 20-percent presidency, which we elected in 1992, or the 40-percent presidency, which we elected in all presidential votes since then. It would be helpful for supporters of the different presidential candidates to work on the assumption that 2022 is headed for yet another election winner with about 40 percent of the vote — while keeping in mind that a close race would make even a 20-percent mandate possible.",0
104,John Nery,"If memory serves me right, Vicente “Ting” Paterno ran for the Senate in 1987 on a simple campaign theme. While his track record was clear and clean, it was also complicated; he had served as a minister in Ferdinand Marcos’ presidential-parliamentary Cabinet, before becoming an independent assemblyman, then Metro Manila chair of the National Citizens’ Movement for Free Elections, then one of “Cory’s Candidates” for the Senate.
His campaign poster cut, or melted, that Gordian knot of complication with a warm but also accurate slogan: “Ting Paterno. Mabuting tao.”

As I have argued before, Cory Aquino had the longest coattails in Philippine history; in that first election for the Senate since the fall of the Marcos regime, 22 of her 24 candidates won. Paterno was one of the non-politicians who rode those same coattails; like them, he also had an impressive personal reputation, backed by a sterling curriculum vitae, that recommended him to the voter. In 1987, the only time he ran for national office, 9.6 million voters cast their ballot for him.

I am reminded of this virtually forgotten moment in history because it might have something to say to us today. Ten months before the first vote is cast, I’ll step out on a limb (again), and suggest that the 2022 elections will be about change. If correct, this is good for the political opposition — even though they will share this message with other politicians and political parties. Those allied with President Duterte since the start, such as Senate President Tito Sotto and Sen. Ping Lacson, have consolidated their strategy to put some legitimate distance between themselves and the President. The President himself has inexplicably decided to go to war against the one politician who can divide the President’s own Mindanao base; if Sen. Manny Pacquiao decides to run for the presidency, he will not position himself as opposition (he will not attack the President directly); rather, he will self-identify as someone more deeply committed to the President’s own program—which, seen through the surrealist prism of Philippine politics, effectively turns him into a change candidate.

How will the opposition position itself? It’s becoming clearer by the week that the only real and viable option for the political opposition is Vice President Leni Robredo running for president. All other options carry the serious risk of triggering disunity and a free-for-all.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
Part of Robredo’s appeal is that she is an excellent executive. Despite having one of the smallest budgets of any government agency, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) has (to borrow another boxing metaphor) punched well above its weight. The OVP’s performance during the pandemic has been nothing short of extraordinary; the budget hearings last year allowed lawmakers to put their praise on the record. She appeals to those who want the opposite of the incumbent.

The untimely death of former president Noynoy Aquino has only sharpened the contrast between the current administration and what some people have called, for lack of a better term, “disente” governance. The problem with the term, and the attitude that gives rise to the term, is that it can be condescending, unconsciously paternalistic, even sometimes elitist. It grates.
But the phrase “mabuting tao” (a good person) doesn’t seem to carry all that extra baggage. To be sure, I am Bisaya, but growing up in Metro Manila in the ‘70s and ‘80s, “mabuting tao” seemed to me to be a genuine compliment, the more effective (and affecting) because it wasn’t reaching for superlatives. I had the chance to meet Senator Paterno a number of times, and he truly was “mabuting tao” — in exactly the same way that fisherman Ka Virgilio Santos of Hagonoy, Bulacan, who hosted me in 1985, was; in the same way that Myrna Aboniawan, now Siose, of Cagayan de Oro, who works with Archbishop Emeritus Antonio Ledesma, is; in the same way that Doc Leslie Manalo Medina of Holy Angel University, or Elin Guro of Mindanao State University in Marawi, are. The list is endless — and that’s the hopeful thing.

However, I understand “mabuting tao” also in the late interior secretary Jesse Robredo’s terms; that is to say, not only good but also competent. In his phrasing: “matino at mahusay.”
It is precisely for this reason that Sen. Kiko Pangilinan’s decisive action to sue YouTube channels “Starlet” and “Latest Chika,” as well as Google Philippines’ country manager Bernadette Nacario, for highly defamatory and completely fabricated videos against him and his wife, the megastar actress Sharon Cuneta, inspires me. To reclaim the life that is worthy of the best of us, we must not only be good people; we must also be smart, daring, effective.
This was a risky action, because it invites even more trolling against the opposition senator and because Google, which owns YouTube, has immense resources. It is literally a trillion-dollar company. But the move is welcome. It puts the onus on Google and YouTube to clean up their act, and it sprays those fetid channels with the disinfectant of daylight.",0
105,John Nery,"The rejection a year ago of the franchise renewal application of the ABS-CBN network by the House of Representatives committee on legislative franchises was a political decision; it should have political consequences.

It was political in the barest, most basic sense: It was a display of power, made against the evidence provided by the very government agencies invited by the committee, against clear public opinion in favor of the network. At the end of the lengthy process, involving 12 hearings altogether, one of the three leaders of the anti-ABS-CBN inquisition, Rep. Rodante Marcoleta, summed up the entire proceeding with an unforgettable phrase. Notwithstanding the favorable testimony of the representatives of the various government agencies called to Congress, and the testimony of the network’s own representatives, Marcoleta said, “it is the will of Congress that must be accorded respect.”

“Killing” the application then (to use another unforgettable quote, this time from Rep. Mike Defensor) was an act of political will, the will of Congress. The 70 congressmen who voted at the committee level to reject a new franchise for the ABS-CBN network wanted it, and willed it to happen.

But fearing the consequences of an obviously unpopular decision, the House of Representatives then under the leadership of Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, and now under the leadership of Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, has declined to release the official list of those who voted against the network. Typical conduct in these times: the privileges and perks of power, without the responsibilities. But an unofficial list exists, and lawmakers and House insiders alike attest to its accuracy. The accuracy is important, because the voters who were offended by the naked power play of Congress, caused by President Duterte’s own and often repeated threats to shut down ABS-CBN, should be able to exact accountability at the ballot box.

But taking offense is not enough; the pushback against the 70 perpetrators of what I and others have called “legislative murder” should not be left to chance. There is an ongoing signature campaign to justify a people’s initiative to enact a law granting the ABS-CBN network a new franchise; there are some two million Bayan patrollers—the citizen journalists trained by the network over the years; there are many millions of new subscribers to the different ABS-CBN channels online. These and other supporters of the network can be harnessed to make the politicians who voted unfairly on the franchise issue face political consequences.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
The campaign can take the following forms:

First, as platform. All candidates for the House, the Senate, and the presidency should be asked if they commit to a new franchise for the ABS-CBN network at the soonest possible time, in the 19th Congress. This will not only put every candidate on the record; it may well create a momentum for a new franchise.

I realize a campaign pledge can degenerate into a form of costless signaling, more cheap talk. That is a feature, not a bug, of electoral politics. But seeking the reversal of an unjust policy, taking up a popular cause, strengthening press freedom: These are important democratic initiatives in themselves, and if the renewal of the ABS-CBN franchise as a campaign platform generates a groundswell of support in the political class, or creates a sense of inevitability in the political calendar, then we should count that as a real gain.

Second, as retribution. Holding politicians to account for their acts of omission or commission is the very nature of the democratic project. That old saying, about elections presenting voters the opportunity to “throw the rascals out,” is not a threat; it is the promise of every election.
At the same time, not all 70 lawmakers who voted against ABS-CBN are equally vulnerable. To make the promise of democratic elections work to its advantage, the public must organize itself, and then determine who among the 70 or their chosen successor-rascals can be successfully thrown out.

Let the political consequences fall where they may — but before the public aggrieved by the rejection of the ABS-CBN franchise can get even, it must get organized.",0
106,John Nery,"Some 10 days after the unexpected death of ex-president Noynoy Aquino, and about 10 months before the 2022 national elections, it might be good to ask: What is the state of the opposition?
Colleague Manolo Quezon has responded to my previous analyses of the prospects of the political opposition with a sweeping conclusion: Everyone becomes opposition anyway, the closer the next elections get. If true, this makes “opposition” as an analytical concept porous, ambiguous to the point of irrelevance.

But history shows us that this in fact isn’t true. In 2016, both the Roxas and Poe campaigns promised continuity with the reformist agenda of the second Aquino administration, and even candidate Rodrigo Duterte, who did campaign on a platform of change, used the three Comelec-sponsored presidential debates to also promote a corollary message: that he would have no problems implementing other campaign platforms, including that of administration candidate Roxas, as long as they work.

The 1992 and 1998 elections featured more than one viable candidate campaigning for continuity: Ramos, Mitra, even arguably Salonga in 1992; and De Venecia, Lim, Roco in 1998. It’s possible that the two elections which served as a referendum on President Gloria Arroyo may be the rare events with only one continuity candidate each: Arroyo herself in 2004, Teodoro in 2010. (The last reading, however, depends on whether Manny Villar would be classified as a candidate for continuity — remember “Villarroyo”? — or change.) So even on the simplified basis of continuity or change, “opposition” remains a very real thing. Are there prospective candidates in 2022 who represent change, and thus should be classified as opposition? Of course.

Is the popular boxer Manny Pacquiao opposition then? Of course not. He may be in for the political fight of his life, but it is a fight being fought squarely within the ropes President Duterte himself set. Despite all his talk about corruption in the government (which, needless to say, the opposition should encourage), Pacquiao continues to represent continuity with the Duterte agenda: hard line on crime, partiality to favored businesses, use of the national security mantle.

After Pacquiao last week, former senator Sonny Trillanes launched a new exposé against Sen. Bong Go (and by implication, President Duterte) this week. Is Trillanes opposition? Of course. He campaigned against Mr. Duterte’s candidacy, he criticized the new administration even before it took office, he has repeatedly resisted many administration attempts to put him back in detention. His new exposé is also much more detailed than Pacquiao’s, and forms part of a year-long pattern that includes filing a case at the International Criminal Court. Even more important, he represents change; he has been unreservedly loyal to Vice President Leni Robredo, and remains committed to stopping the democratic erosion of the last five years.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
To say there is no difference between Pacquiao and Trillanes, that “opposition” covers them equally well, is to misunderstand the situation.

That situation has changed dramatically in the last week and a half. Permission to be proud. Aquino’s untimely death on June 24 has given many Filipinos, not only those who happily worked for him, the opportunity to take pride in both the achievements of the Aquino administration and its strong work ethic. I would characterize this as a rediscovery, because for the first five years of his term, and then at the end of it, Aquino was more popular than previous presidents. The contrast is there to be made; while like others I appreciate the stories about Aquino’s habitual kindness, I do not think this is where the real story lies—because for many people President Duterte is also courteous and compassionate in person. The real difference is in their approach to governance, which explains the different results.

Reason for grievance, rumblings of disunity. Aquino’s death has also driven an old wedge back into the left/center coalition which, for now, represents the political opposition. Memories of how the National Democratic left demonized Aquino, contrasted with their early embrace of President Duterte, has slowed the already sluggish drive for opposition unity. The irrepressible Lourd de Veyra gave a sharp edge to the issue, when he appropriated the insult the left used to caricature Aquino, “Noynoying,” and redefined it to mean something altogether positive, honorable, extraordinary.

Search for the true legacy-bearer. The explosion of goodwill and the rediscovery of the abiding good that the Aquino political tradition has done immediately prompted a search for the right person to carry on Noynoy Aquino’s legacy. Dean Mel Sta. Maria started an online ruckus when he urged Aquino’s celebrity sister Kris to run for office (you can read my thoughts on that in “Thanks, Kris, but are you sure you want it?,” which I wrote way back in 2009). But there is a worthy Aquino to pass the baton to: ex-senator Bam Aquino. And there is a worthy candidate for president to carry the torch: Robredo.

But there have been other disturbances in the force. Let me discuss them online, at johnnery.wordpress.com.",0
107,John Nery,"It is not true that the second President Aquino never got his due. Before President Duterte reached new records in satisfaction or approval ratings, Noynoy Aquino was the most popular president since regular surveys began. In fact, and I would think very few of us would remember this, his high ratings remained high in the immediate aftermath of the “Yolanda” catastrophe.
In “Analysts before surveys: Aquino post-‘Yolanda’ edition” (1/7/2014), I gently criticized the Reuters news agency for basic innumeracy. A Reuters analysis that ran on Nov. 15, 2013, a week after Yolanda, pushed a narrative of “backlash” against the President for the initial handling of the disaster by basing it on a fundamental error. Reuters alleged that Aquino’s satisfaction ratings had plunged from 74 percent to 49 percent in September (crucially, several weeks BEFORE the supertyphoon made landfall). In fact, the first figure (from March 2013) was raw satisfaction (or number of satisfied), while the second figure was net satisfaction (that is, number of satisfied minus number of dissatisfied). The raw satisfaction rating for September 2013 was actually 68 percent—still down from 74, but not by as much. In other words, Reuters compared the raw apple with the net orange.

What explains this basic mistake? The analysis carried a sensational but unsupported headline: “Analysis: From hero to zero: Philippine president feels typhoon backlash.” Aside from the erroneous comparison between two surveys, the analysis included pessimistic comments from political commentators and this narrative-driven conclusion: “Political analysts say Aquino’s ratings will likely suffer in the next opinion polls, especially in the typhoon-swept central Philippine provinces that have been bastions of support.” (As I noted in my column, I shared that rapidly formed conventional wisdom, too.)

It was certainly conventional, but it wasn’t wise. In fact, it was the exact opposite; it was folly.
“From 68 percent in September, the President’s satisfaction rating [in December 2013] held statistically steady at 69 percent; his net satisfaction rating remained at plus 49 percent. In the Visayas, the hardest-hit disaster areas, his satisfaction rating rose from 68 to 70 percent … and his net satisfaction remained statistically steady, up from plus-48 to plus-50.”

I did not fully understand it then, but I can see now, from what the Reuters example shows, that Yolanda may have marked the point where the media narrative about the second Aquino presidency diverged from public opinion. A raw satisfaction rating of 69 percent in the immediate aftermath of the most powerful storm ever recorded is something to marvel at. And yet, while a still patient people continued to give President Aquino his due, the media had found a new narrative to push. From hero to zero, indeed.

It was only after the Mamapasano incident that public opinion caught up with the media narrative. In March 2015, Aquino received his lowest ratings: 47 percent raw satisfaction, 11 percent net. The high death toll and the internal politics of the raid finally snapped the people’s patience. Aquino’s decision not to receive the caskets of the (42 of 44) slain SAF officers flown back to Manila may well have been the pivotal moment. As I have argued in many columns, for instance in “What is Aquino accountable for?” (2/3/2015), his decision-making was partly at fault. And yet, even today, after his death, many in the mainstream media have continued to internalize the negative narrative about Aquino in the last half of his term. In the Philippine Star’s first story on his passing, for instance, the SAF raid was described as a “failed” operation—when in fact the main objective was met: the capture or death of the terrorist Marwan. The cost of success was steep, but as controversial and fault-ridden as it was, the raid succeeded.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
When people say, then, that President Aquino did not get his due, my own reflection on my own practice and that of my profession leads me to two related conclusions: First, they mean, even without directly accusing the mainstream media, that the media narratives about Aquino during his presidency had failed to reflect the full scope and true scale of his achievements. And second, they mean that the new gatekeepers of reputation, even without directly referring to the architects and influencers and grassroots operators of what the scholars Jonathan Corpus Ong and Jason Cabañes call an “invisible machine” of networked disinformation, have built their own negative narratives about Aquino, and these have obscured the nature and character of his presidency.

Once, the Inquirer hosted a group of Asian journalists; it was my task to announce President Aquino’s arrival. Palace staff told me, repeatedly, that protocol required me to say “the President of the Philippines,” not the more familiar, more usual, “President of the Republic of the Philippines.” When Aquino arrived at the Inquirer’s multi-purpose hall, I dutifully announced: “Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Philippines.”

But it was Press Secretary Sonny Coloma’s role to introduce Aquino before he read his speech, and when he did, he introduced him, simply, and to my everlasting amusement, in the exact way I was told not to: “Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Republic of the Philippines!”
I remember this anecdote now, because the outpouring of praise for his character and his presidency, the belated settling and resolving of media accounts, reminded me that, while he was a reluctant president, he was also a good one. He deserves to be introduced, for all time, according to the phrasing we find in the Constitution he defended and consulted every single day: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Philippines.",0
108,John Nery,"With the political class now focused on next year’s elections, it is even more important for us as voters and as citizens to distinguish signal from noise. We are hearing a lot from allies of President Duterte and other members of his governing coalition; the President himself has been talking up (or talking down—same difference) about the possibility of running for vice president. The different factions are busy maneuvering for position. Much of what we hear is noise, but I think the following signals are clearly being sent: Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte, Manila City Mayor Isko Moreno, and Sen. Manny Pacquiao are running for president. While long considering a run for the presidency himself, former senator Bongbong Marcos is now open to running for vice president again. Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano is thinking of higher office again, but he will run for the Senate, where like Marcos he will be a shoo-in. House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez is a strong contender for speaker, if he runs for a fifth term as congressman, but the appeal of national office, whether senator or vice president, is strong. Part of the appeal is the support of two presidents: Mr. Duterte and Gloria Arroyo. Also, Romualdez coming close to winning a Senate seat in 2016, with over 12 million votes, is signal, not noise.

We are hearing much from the ranks of the opposition, and from those who have begun to distance themselves from the Duterte administration. I’m afraid the launch of the 1Sambayan selection process the other week generated more noise, but the following signals came through loud and clear: The left has embraced the 1Sambayan process more than the center; the excitement over Batangas Rep. Vilma Santos running for national office is genuine; the Sambayan process aside, only Vice President Leni Robredo seems capable of winning unified support.

But as frustrated Robredo supporters know only too well, the Vice President is not yet ready to decide. There was one other signal I heard in the aftermath of the 1Sambayan launch; to be completely candid, I’ve written on this exact point before, so it is possible that I heard it because I wanted to hear it. But bear with me: Robredo has the power to convene a genuinely unified Senate slate.

We heard Sen. Ping Lacson say nice-enough things about Robredo, but as far as his own plans are concerned, he says, now, that it is either the presidency or bust. We heard reelectionist Sen. Joel Villanueva downplay his father’s inclusion in the 1Sambayan short list, because of recent family tragedies; we also heard that Sen. Nancy Binay, who was reelected to the Senate in 2019, asked that her name be removed from consideration. But the reality is, 1Sambayan IS talking to Bro. Eddie Villanueva and former vice president Jojo Binay. All of those who were named as part of the short list of presidential and vice presidential candidates were in discussions with Sambayan. And some progress seems to have been reached in the search for campaign donations. Above all, we heard Robredo say this, in Filipino, on her Sunday radio program the day after the 1Sambayan launch: “We need to understand why many are attracted to the President, why many are attracted to these politicians.” Also: “We cannot say … that we are the only good ones.” Not least: “That because others believe differently, then they are bad—that cannot be.”

New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
This is the altogether credible language of unity; the opposition needs to bring different forces together. In its Senate slate, it must make room for those who have consistently opposed the Duterte coalition, and for those it can make common cause with: Lacson, the younger Villanueva, the older Binay, Santos and her husband Ralph Recto, and so on. In this sense, Robredo has the power to convene a true unified slate; given the opposition’s straitened circumstances, power is also duty.

I see that my colleague Manolo Quezon has, in his otherwise instructive newsletter marking Jose Rizal’s 160th birthday, again recommended the great Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno as a reference on, and for, the national hero. It is true that, especially in the 1960s, Unanumo’s reflections on Rizal commanded the attention of the country’s leading intellectuals. But as I wrote in “One who got it all wrong” (10/19/2010), Unamuno got it all wrong. I developed the argument in my “Revolutionary Spirit,” but the gist of it is that the philosopher who broke the (rather simple) code Rizal used in his diaries misunderstood Rizal completely. He thought Rizal was “an impenitent dreamer,” he called him “a weak and irresolute man for action and life,” he described the martyr as “a Quijote of thought, who looked with repugnance upon the impurities of reality.” In fact, Rizal was a man of many projects, who got his hands (literally) dirty, who made difficult decisions and took courageous action time and again. The worst of Unamuno’s reflections is that he accepted (and to use a current term, amplified) the view that Rizal saw himself as undone by presumption. This is the Spanish colonial view: Poor Rizal was only a Filipino, who overreached and was ruined in Spain and other foreign countries. Like I said, Unamuno got Rizal all wrong.",0
109,John Nery,"The issue of the true location of the first Mass celebrated in the Philippines is an old one. Is it Butuan, as a Spanish tradition held, or is it Limasawa, as historical research asserts? As part of the preparations to mark the 500th anniversary of Ferdinand Magellan’s arrival in the Philippines and Lapu-Lapu’s victory in the Battle of Mactan, the National Quincentennial Committee (NQC) convened a panel of experts to investigate the controversy, yet again. This wasn’t the first time that the Philippine government conducted an official expert inquiry into the issue.

The first one took place in 1980; the second one, called the Gancayco Committee after its chair, former Supreme Court justice Emilio Gancayco, convened in 1995; the third attempt, a committee headed by historian Benito Legarda Jr., met in 2008. All three found that the evidence supported Limasawa.

Just the same, in late 2018, the NQC formed the Mojares panel, named after its chair, National Artist for Literature Resil Mojares. The memorandum read: “Notwithstanding the possibilities that reopening this controversy may open old wounds or even create new ones, the [National Historical Commission of the Philippines] and the NQC want everyone to be somber, respectful, and professional. Moreover, all must follow the basic rule of doing historiographical studies, i.e., every assertion must be supported by credible, authentic, and verifiable primary sources. Second, everyone should be guided by the fact that no one has a monopoly on truth and all must be given equal opportunity to articulate his position on this issue. Lastly, we should be prepared to accept the possibility that the NQC may not be able to settle this issue conclusively because of the unavailability and ambiguity of the sources.” And yet in fact the Mojares panel, which included eminent experts Dr. Danilo Gerona, Dr. Francis Navarro, Dr. Carlos Madrid Alvarez-Piñer, Fr. Antonio de Castro, SJ, and Dr. Jose Victor Torres, reached a robust conclusion.

After a calibrated process that took a year and included a focus group discussion “done solely for the Butuan proponents” in November 2018, three exhaustive meetings of the panel (in Cebu in December 2018, in Tacloban in April 2019, and in Manila in July 2019), and four site inspections, the Mojares panel concluded that, “based on the evidence presented and the research it has conducted in aid of the evaluation, the evidence and arguments presented by the pro-Butuan proponents, while commendably serious and substantial, are not sufficiently conclusive as to demand a repeal or reversal of the current government ruling on the case of the First Easter Sunday Mass. The panel therefore recommends that Limasawa Island, Leyte, be sustained as the site of the First Easter Sunday Mass of 1521.”
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
The well-written panel report is a compelling read; it can be downloaded as a PDF file from the NHCP website. It reached other conclusions, including a grace note for the Butuan tradition: “The panel, however, recognizes the deep historical significance of the greater Butuan area as a precolonial trading center and base in the Christianization of Mindanao, a significance that transcends the question of whether or not it is the site of the ‘first mass.’ The panel therefore recommends that the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) initiate and support the promotion of Butuan as a one of the country’s premier historic sites.” But one of the Butuan proponents, Dr. Potenciano R. Malvar, rejected the findings of the fourth government inquiry. And in March 2021, just before the new wave of COVID-19 cases struck, he filed suit.

Alleging libel and the crime of falsification, he accused the members of the Mojares panel, as well as an expert who served in an advisory capacity, of having “maliciously concluded, without any explanation and basis that my presentation or position paper was based on conjectures and fictional account.”

What exactly did the Mojares panel report say about Malvar’s presentation?

“The evidence presented by Malvar in his paper that Pigafetta’s latitude measurement of 9°3/4’ was part of a plan to conceal the actual location of the First Easter Sunday Mass to protect the route to the Moluccas is based on conjectures from ideas derived from secondary sources including a fictional account of the Magellan Expedition.

“The panel contends that if there was such a plan or intent to conceal the route of the expedition, the part of the route that should have been hidden would be the coordinates to the passage through the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America and not that of the Philippines. It was this passage to the West that was one of the primary objectives of the expedition as it was the way to get to the Spice Islands through a western route beyond Portuguese territory. 

“Malvar’s thesis was, therefore, not accepted by the panel.”

To this carefully reasoned, evidence-based refutation of Malvar’s position, he responds in extraordinary fashion: by filing criminal complaints against the experts in the panel. This is dangerous nonsense; when Malvar joined the NHCP’s Call for Papers, he willingly accepted the parameters of a scholarly inquiry. Now that his claims have been judged—by a panel of experts—as unworthy of further consideration, he cannot run to the courts to enforce his own view. That would be to weaponize the law against historical truth.",0
110,John Nery,"Rolando Andaya Jr., a Camarines Sur representative for a total of 18 years and a budget secretary for four, is back in the news. Two weeks ago, it was for surviving an apparent assassination attempt. (The circumstances as initially reported drew a puzzling picture; the gunmen fired two shots, but Andaya said he didn’t realize what was happening and even went down from the vehicle to check on the disturbance.) And last week, it was for orchestrating ex-defense secretary and former presidential candidate Gilbert Teodoro’s return to the spotlight.
The stage was Davao City, specifically the office of Mayor Inday Sara Duterte, and the occasion was not the birthday of the President’s daughter and survey frontrunner (although it took place the week of her birthday) but rather the start of the theater season — election theater, that is. Andaya was both impresario and performer: He emceed Teodoro’s visit on social and traditional media, and played his role as enthusiastic supporter of what he called a “done deal”—the pairing of Sara and Teodoro as running mates in the 2022 elections—to the hilt.
It was, of course, no such thing. There was no done deal.

In the first place, Sara has not made a definitive announcement about her 2022 plans; it helps to have sycophantic supplicants like Andaya reinforce the inevitability of her presidential run, but it will simply not do for the announcement to be made through underlings. Secondly, and more important, it does not make logical or electoral sense for Sara, leading the pack of possible presidential candidates at 27 percent, to choose a sometime politician unheard from the last five years and polling at 0.5 percent in terms of vice presidential preferences as running mate. Aside from the funding she can get from Teodoro and his allies, including former president Gloria Arroyo—funds which she can raise elsewhere, from other allies—Teodoro at this point brings nothing to the table.

Thirdly, the language Andaya used to explain his “done deal” statement gave the game away. He called the younger Duterte and Teodoro “soulmates,” as though their political union were inevitable. But the actual statement immediately showed just how absurd, vapid, and manipulative it was: “Parang natural, parang soulmates na nagkita pero soulmates talaga.” The connection between the mayor and her visitor, Andaya said, was like natural, like they were soulmates who met, like true soulmates. Right.

This is not to say that Sara and Teodoro did not hit it off; they probably did. Teodoro’s visit must have gone as well as that of the Marcos siblings, who met the mayor two days before her birthday. (In terms of election theater, the visit by Sen. Imee Marcos and her brother Bongbong can be understood as a preview.)

Teodoro, who declined President Duterte’s offer to serve again as defense secretary in 2016, has been immersed in the private sector since he ran and lost in the 2010 presidential election. He was a capable defense secretary under President Arroyo, who earned the respect of both Washington, DC, and Beijing; but it is political fantasy to think that, 12 years after his last political appointment, he has what a presidential candidate needs in a running mate.
New DOTr chief Dizon: ‘We need the Edsa busway’ | INQToday
Andaya’s entire objective in last week’s news cycle, then, was to simply raise Teodoro’s profile again, perhaps for a senatorial run. Was there in fact a done deal with Mayor Duterte? Listen to his spin, and one should immediately realize that it IS spin. Speaking mostly in Filipino, he explained that the done deal he was speaking of was something he imagined: “Sa isip ko ‘yun.” But unwilling yet to let go of a good narrative theme, he immediately added, again speaking mostly in Filipino: But now that I’m on my way out of city hall, in my view this is a done deal for the country, too. Then, back to reality: In only a short while, he said, this tandem won’t be just a dream anymore, but will be the tandem of the entire country.

In signaling theory, this is an example of cheap talk. Like promising to effect a reform in three to six months, the act of talking cheaply does not cost the speaker much. If the audience, whether adversary or ally, accepts the statement at face value, good for the speaker. If not, it doesn’t matter to the speaker either. It didn’t cost much.

Andaya’s stunt last week is cheap talk in this exact sense: His bluster about a done deal got lots of airtime and media space; it was designed to do so, and it was designed precisely in a way that would appeal to the media. It wasn’t cheap by the standards of the ordinary citizen, of course; after all, they flew on a private plane to Davao City. But it was cheap to Andaya and Teodoro and their political allies both financially and politically: They got the media to play along by sending a costless signal. If the media had ignored them, they would have shrugged their shoulders and gone on to the next stunt. 

A costly signal is one that requires a serious investment, in resources, preparation, money. The orchestrated campaign to support Sara Duterte’s presidential candidacy, by accumulating 17 million signatures, is an example. It sends a very clear message that Sara is in fact serious about running; unfortunately, the cost of that costly signal (public officials’ time, public resources’ use) is charged to the Filipino’s account.",0
111,Iris Gonzales,"When one mentions EDSA, motorists and commuters alike will almost certainly feel that familiar sense of dread– dread of the legendary traffic we endure long before we actually reach Metro Manila’s main thoroughfare. We feel it on any given day, including Sundays, and experience it before, during and after we’re actually plying the busy road.

And yet, the 23-kilometer highway also gives us access to almost anywhere. Pass by EDSA, and you can get to any part of the metropolis – north, south, east, west or beyond.

EDSA and its role in our lives – or these two extreme experiences of being stuck and being able to move forward – are the perfect metaphor to describe what the historic EDSA Revolution of Feb. 25, 1986 brought to our country.

It brought us hope – such fervent hope – and the promise of a better tomorrow.

I am reminded of what Charles Dickens said in “A Tale of Two Cities:”

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.”

Thirty-nine years later, I still believe, as I did then, that EDSA held the promise of a better tomorrow. It was a moment in our history that was necessary. It had to happen because the two-decade dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., which set our country and economy back – to this day – had to end. EDSA was the change our country needed during that tumultuous period in our history.

But what happened after was a failure in governance, a lack of follow-through and a typical Filipino trait: ningas-kugon, or fleeting enthusiasm.

It left us a new constitution – the 1987 Constitution – which allowed corrupt officials to return to power through a multi-party system.

It didn’t help that those who ruled after EDSA became the ogres they initially tried to slay, although sadly, this is typical in countries that overthrew dictators.

Take Libya, for example. In 2011, the country overthrew its long-time dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, but failed to transition into a better nation. Today, it remains plagued by civil war as different groups continue to fight for power.

Egypt, too, ousted Hosni Mubarak in 2011, but today, the country is considered the second most vulnerable to a debt crisis, and hopes for democratic change remain elusive under the El-Sisi regime and its new brand of authoritarianism.

Yemen ousted its dictator, Ali Abdullah Saleh, in 2011, but to this day, the country continues to face multiple crises, including the Houthi rebellion, which remains a threat to lasting peace.

If we compare ourselves to these countries, we can surely heave a sigh of relief – maybe even pop the champagne bottles.

After all, we have reasons to do so – there are no gunfights or blood on the streets, no refugee camps and no violent disruptions in our daily lives.

Deep state
But if we look closer, we might actually have it worse, to a certain extent.

This is because what exists in our country today is a deep state of sorts – a parallel, elite-driven secret network that seems to manipulate policy to favor the powerful few and maintain the status quo that protects them.

The result is the stark and widening income inequality in our country today.

How did we get here?

There are many reasons.

First, we must look at how Corazon Aquino and her successors failed to do enough to protect the gains of EDSA. It was an opportunity to create stronger institutions – from justice to education to health – to build a more inclusive economy and lift millions out of poverty.

But incompetence, in-fighting during the Aquino administration, the power struggles within the Yellow Camp, the disappointment and disillusionment that followed and the failed coups d’état all pushed our country backward.

The people, too, forgot that the revolution was not just a three-day affair – it was an ongoing battle.

Thus, in the years that followed, it was more of the same – an elite-driven economy that isolated the poorest of the poor.

As such, the poverty incidence in the Philippines – or the proportion of Filipinos whose per capita income cannot sufficiently meet the individual basic food and non-food needs – was recorded at 18.1 percent in 2021 from 16.7 percent in 2018. This translates to around 19.99 million Filipinos living below the poverty threshold of about P12,030 per month for a family of five, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).

And now, here we are again, back to another Marcos presidency.

As I wrote in 2023 for PhilStar Life:

“With the EDSA Revolution in the middle of our long, storied journey, the Philippines is in many ways still in limbo. We are in that spring of hope and yet, also in the winter of despair.

“In many ways, it’s exactly like EDSA, the avenue – a few good lanes but riddled with countless potholes and all.”

And may I add – with a bus lane for the masses that is constantly abused by the entitled and the elite, as with many things in our country today.",0
112,Iris Gonzales,"From the Sulu archipelago to the West Philippine Sea, the promise of the blue economy runs deep, as deep as the blue waters that glisten under the Philippine sun.

For Professor Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, the Philippines needs a new paradigm shift – one that embraces the blue economy while prioritizing sustainable development.

This is especially critical amid the controversies surrounding the West Philippine Sea.

The blue economy, according to Oxford, refers to an economic system or sector that seeks to conserve marine and freshwater environments while using them in a sustainable way to develop economic growth and produce resources such as energy and food.

“For communities whose livelihoods are inextricably linked to the sea, traditional economic models often fall short, leaving them underserved by national funding allocations,” Prof. Batongbacal said at the “Embracing the Currents: An International Conference on the Sulu Archipelago,” held late last year at the Mindanao State University in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi.

An oceanic university
Fortunately, Prof. Batongbacal said, UP is doing its share in addressing this need through its plan to establish the so-called Archipelagic and Oceanic Virtual University (AOVU).

UP president Angelo Jimenez introduced the AOVU last year, which is poised to reshape how the nation manages its marine resources.

“The AOVU represents a significant shift in approach, recognizing that the archipelago’s future lies in its waters. This will strengthen and empower the Philippines to take possession of its territory and utilize its sovereign rights over its resources. It will also help operationalize the Blue Economy Act once it is passed,” Prof. Batongbacal said.

I agree with UP’s initiative. The AOVU is one of the university’s flagship programs under president Jimenez.

Essentially, AOVU will serve as a centralized hub for graduate degree programs and research initiatives focused on maritime studies.

The virtual university will initially offer four master’s degree programs: Archipelagic Blue Economics and Engineering, Economic Security and Integrity, Archipelagic and Oceanic Environment and Archipelagic Social Studies.

There will also be new programs and initiatives introduced along the way.

In all, UP said, the AOVU would provide continuing professional education in national security, environmental management and maritime diplomacy.

The initiative also aims to correct the historical imbalance that has favored land-based development, finally giving the sea its due attention, Prof. Batongbacal added.

“One of its goals is to cultivate a strong pool of experts and talent who are part of a national, regional and global network, driving planning, implementation, academic research and innovation programs.”

For sure, these efforts will help us address the unique challenges that we face.

Embracing the blue economy
By embracing the blue economy and prioritizing sustainable development, the AOVU aims to empower communities, strengthen governance and unlock the vast potential of the archipelago’s marine resources.

“As the Philippines navigates the complex challenges of the 21st century, the AOVU stands as a beacon of innovation and a testament to the transformative power of education,” Prof. Batongbacal said.

I laud UP and its leadership for initiatives like this which, hopefully, will educate and empower Filipinos and the succeeding generations in dealing with the challenges of managing our marine resources.

I hope that despite cutbacks in education funding in the General Appropriations Act, this initiative can continue.

Another educational initiative, the Center for West Philippine Sea Studies, is pending in Congress along with the proposed National West Philippine Sea Day. The bill creating the Center for West Philippine Sea Studies aims to create a think tank on how the Philippines can better defend and support its territorial claims in the South China Sea.

National Day Reception
Government officials, tycoons, businessmen and diplomats gathered at the glittering Grand Ballroom of Grand Hyatt Manila on Thursday night for the annual National Day of Japan to celebrate the 65th birthday of His Majesty, the Emperor of Japan.

Ambassador Endo Kazuya led the celebration, his first National Day Reception in the Philippines, and his first as ambassador, while Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ma. Hellen de la Vega graced the event and led the toast.

Other distinguished guests included Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero, Speaker of the House of Representatives Martin Romualdez, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo, Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Charles Brown, AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner, Ambassador to the US Jose “Babe” Romualdez, GSIS president and GM Wick Veloso, tycoon Alfred Ty and his wife Cherry and PAL president Capt. Stanley Ng.

Golden age
In his speech, Ambassador Endo said that in recent years, Japan-Philippines relations have entered what is known as the “Golden Age,” sustained by friendship and shared values.

“Since my arrival in March last year, I have witnessed how we have further deepened our wide range of exchanges and cooperation.

“The historic first Japan-Philippines-US Summit was held shortly after my arrival. In the field of security, the second Japan-Philippines Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meeting was held in July and the Japan-Philippines Reciprocal Access Agreement was then signed. The esteemed Senate of the Philippines went on to concur in the agreement’s ratification last December,” he said.
There are many other reasons to celebrate, he added, including strong economic, retail and cultural ties.

It was indeed a lovely evening filled with sumptuous food and sake and more than enough stories shared among guests throughout the night.",0
113,Iris Gonzales,"When you sit down with some of the country’s tycoons and business executives, especially Filipino-Chinese businessmen, you will easily notice an air of frustration over our politics and politicians.

Only those who are really close to President Marcos, either as an adviser, a friend or as an appointed official, would say that everything’s smooth sailing.

In reality though, many of our big businessmen are growing frustrated and even impatient with our dizzying political landscape – the move to tinker with our budget, glaring corruption among some of our lawmakers and that feeling of “walang nangyayari” under the Marcos administration.

Of course, our businessmen – some of them kingmakers – are partly to blame. They keep on supporting these politicians when candidates ask them for support.

But what if, for a change – or for a much-needed respite from politicians – they field somebody from their own ranks and support him or her instead to become the country’s president?

Would a businessman or a tycoon be an effective president of the Philippines? Someone with effective management and leadership skills who can steer our rudderless ship to better shores? Someone who has the brilliance to manage our resources so that our government can provide the right social services to our people? Someone whose goal is no longer just about making money but building a nation for generations and generations to come?

Of course it’s easy to mistrust businessmen, especially in our country where some people perceive them as just a bunch of greedy and profit-oriented oligarchs who only want to enrich themselves.

In reality though, some of the country’s tycoons care about the country and not just themselves, or at least they care more than our politicians do. Just look at how some of them helped our people during the pandemic. Imagine if they didn’t – where would we be now? They care about the future of their children and grandchildren. Some of them want to leave a lasting legacy so their empires are not forgotten.

In any case, a lot of them have the skills and the proven track record to run an organization effectively, perhaps even more so than some of our politicos, something that we need in our country today,

We’ve had success stories when it comes to our debt-strapped utilities of decades past. When these were privatized and transferred to the hands of business executives, services improved.

Even tollways and airports – though a long way from being world-class – are seeing improvements after being privatized.

After all, people with business acumen move fast and efficiently. They anticipate problems before they arise. They are creative and innovative, too.

So what if, for a change, we elect a businessman as president? I’m sure many of them are qualified, perhaps even more qualified than those currently eyeing the presidency in 2028. Some of them are popular and considered as folk heroes.

Actually, I heard from our Republic of Marites that this is something some of our businessmen are considering because many of them have become so frustrated with our political situation. They are considering the idea of supporting a fellow businessman to run for the presidency. The only question is who it will be.

The United States has done it, and no, I’m not even referring to President Donald Trump. There were success stories in the past.

For instance, there’s George Washington, considered as one of the greatest presidents in US history. He was a wealthy landowner and savvy businessman before he became president. There’s also former haberdasher Harry Truman, ranked by historians as among the top five presidents of the US. Jimmy Carter grew the family business successfully before being elected as president of the US in 1977.

This is perhaps because in the US, citizens were more open to having a businessman for president.

“Plenty of businessmen throughout history have sought – and won – the highest office in the US. Some feel this is a positive, bringing the business acumen and efficiency of the private sector into the halls of state,” according to the Business News Daily.

Of course, having a businessman as president of the republic has its risks and it isn’t a magic pill that will make our problems go away. It can also open the door for corruption and cronyism.

But these are desperate times, as seen in the current crop of politicians and candidates we have. Perhaps, it might be something we can consider instead of just voting the same trapos back into office.

Now will a nation-loving businessman capable of leading this country please stand up?",0
114,Iris Gonzales,"The election circus is here; its caravans are painting the town red – wild, boisterous and full of cheers. The candidates and the crowd are excited, jubilant and happy but I’m anxious, disturbed and jittery.

I can’t help but wonder – what’s going to happen in our country after the May 2025 elections, given the latest survey results on voters’ preference for senators?

This is a question for all thinking men who care about the future of this nation of over 120 million; it is a situation that will affect you, me and everyone we know, whether we like it or not.

The survey results are alarming. Our future senatorial line-up will continue to deteriorate if the survey turns into reality.

This is what happens when every Juan dela Cruz audaciously thinks he or she can be a senator of the Philippine Republic – charlatans who are taking us for fools.

We can blame democracy for this. The qualifications to vie for a Senate seat are very basic – natural-born Filipino citizens, at least 35 years old on election day, able to read and write, a registered voter and a resident of the country.

But if you look at the roster of Filipino statesmen from decades past, it is shameless for some of our current crop of candidates to think that they are qualified to be in the league of the esteemed men and women who, once upon a time in history, walked the august halls of our chamber.

These statesmen are the ones worthy of being called solons, which doesn’t just mean a legislator but a wise and skillful one. The term is derived from Solon himself, an ancient Athenian statesman, lawmaker, political philosopher and poet. He was one of the Seven Sages of Greece.

Among our Filipino statesmen were Jovito Salonga, Lorenzo Tañada, Jose “Pepe” Diokno, Vicente Sotto (not Tito Sotto), Ambrosio Padilla, Blas Ople, Gil Puyat, Benigno Aquino, Eva Estrada-Kalaw, Rene Saguisag.

They must now be rolling in their graves, helpless in protecting the chamber.

It is we, the voters, who must do that now.

But why is it so difficult for Filipinos to vote for change? Why are we so afraid to vote, for instance, for those from the grassroots movement even though they are not well known? Why are we so afraid to vote for new names, new ideas?

Surveys show a disturbing trend. With the exception of a few names, traditional politicians dominate the surveys. Some former celebrities turned lawmakers, including those previously involved in pork barrel scams, and celebrity newcomers who admit not knowing much about lawmaking, are among those in the so-called Magic 12, according to the Jan. 25 to 31 OCTA Research Group survey.

Those in the Magic 12 come from the senatorial slates of the Marcos and Duterte camps.

A PNA article on the latest OCTA survey states:

“Nine candidates backed by the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. are among the probable winners in the 2025 Senate race based on the latest OCTA Research pre-election survey.

“The survey, conducted from Jan. 25 to 31, showed ACT-CIS Party-list Rep. Erwin Tulfo as the most preferred candidate, topping the poll with 70 percent voter preference.”

Former senate president Tito Sotto III ranked third to eighth with 52 percent, Sen. Bong Revilla Jr. ranked fourth to 11th with 49 percent; former senator Panfilo Lacson at fourth to 11th with 48 percent; Sen. Pia Cayetano at fourth to 11th with 46 percent and former senator Manny Pacquiao at fifth to 12th with 45 percent.

Furthermore, Sen. Imee Marcos placed fifth to 13th with 44 percent, while Sen. Lito Lapid ranked fifth to 14th with 43 percent. Former interior secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. secured the ninth to 16th spot with 39 percent, rounding out the administration-backed candidates in the Top 12, according to PNA.

Three non-administration candidates also made the top 12 – Ben Tulfo (second to third with 60 percent); Sen. Bong Go (second to fourth with 58 percent) and TV host Willie Revillame, who is also running as an independent and is tied with Lacson at fourth to 11th with 48 percent.

The nationwide survey was conducted among 1,200 respondents and has a three percent margin of error, the article also said.

None of the progressive, grassroots or so-called opposition candidates came even close to the so-called Magic 12.

Filipinos prefer to vote for those who’ve been “tried and tested.” But what track record do our trapos have?

The responsibility of a senator is huge – creating bills, resolutions, conducting inquiries in aid of legislation and trying cases of impeachment, among others.

Every action or inaction will affect our country, our people.

What we really need are senators who are sincere and brilliant enough to help steer our country toward a better future; toward a society that will do away with the exploitation of man and reset the rhythm of our nation. We need men and women who are not driven by greed, lust, power or ambition.

We need to bring statesmen back to our chambers. We needed them yesterday and we need them more tomorrow.

As we go out and vote in May, may we remember the difference between a politician and a statesman, as wisely defined by the American theologian and author James Freeman Clark:

“A politician thinks about the next election while the statesman thinks about the next generation.”",0
115,Iris Gonzales,"Let me tell you about a man long gone but never forgotten.

He was one of those gentlemen from the old school, as rare today as fragments of the moon.

Let me tell you about his life, because it’s worth emulating, a much needed reminder especially in these challenging times that a life lived with purpose and honor is the kind of life we should all aspire for.

He was Jorge Gonzales, an esteemed lawyer, honorable public servant, successful builder and a prolific writer. He was, to put it simply, a Renaissance man who served his family, his country and his fellowmen well, and I am proud to be his granddaughter.

I rarely write about my personal life or my loved ones but allow me this moment to honor my paternal grandfather because days ago, within the august halls of the Goldenberg Mansion inside the Malacañang complex in Manila, the Upsilon Sigma Phi of the University of the Philippines honored his life and his work.

My grandfather was awarded the Upsilonian Noble and Outstanding (UNO) award, the highest distinction given by the Fraternity to its members.

Says the Upsilon in its citation:
“Jorge Gonzales embodied resilience and leadership during some of the most challenging periods in Philippine history. As an active member of Upsilon Sigma Phi during World War II, Gonzales nurtured fraternity unity and strength. He was instrumental in recruiting members who shared Upsilon’s ideals, ensuring its survival and growth during turbulent times.

“In his post-war efforts, Gonzales revitalized the fraternity and inspired younger generations to uphold the fraternity’s values. His career as associate editor of the Philippine Collegian showcased his dedication to ethical journalism, while his work in affordable housing initiatives reflected his commitment to improving the lives of others. His mentorship and advocacy left a lasting imprint on the fraternity and the nation.”

Of love and war
Born in Sigma, Capiz on July 27, 1919, Jorge was the eldest among a brood of seven children.

He hailed from a middle-class family but the hardships of life were not lost on him as he was born in an epoch characterized by one war after another – from World War I to World War II.

He knew early on the importance of hard work, courage, justice and, most of all, service to his fellowmen and country.

All throughout the war years, Jorge, like the rest of the student population, was forced to stop schooling.

But Jorge, as a young adult, responded to the spirit of the times. He thought of ways to help his country and his fellow Filipinos win the war.

Quietly and courageously, and at the risk of his own life, he helped guerrillas while working as a shoe shine boy in the streets of Manila. He eavesdropped on his clients while he quietly cleaned their shoes and made a mental note of whatever information he could gather about the ongoing war.

He would then pass this on to the guerrilla fighters to help them in their battle.

In 1958, president Carlos Garcia, who was known for his “Filipino First” policy, appointed him to Napocor where he later became chief legal counsel, tasked with scrutinizing contracts to make sure that taxpayers’ money did not go to waste. He served Napocor for 20 years, retiring in December 1978 at the age of 60.

In his sunset years, Jorge never really retired. He remained generous with his time, talent and skills.

He put up a build-and-sell business focused on low-cost homes, enabling young families to afford their own house and lot while also providing employment for dozens of construction workers.

Aside from his accomplishments, he was also a very kind man, a loving family patriarch and a proud husband to my grandmother, Belen, a former English professor at UP.

As a grandfather, he grabbed every opportunity to teach us, his grandchildren, about the ways of the world and the importance of always doing what is right.

But I remember him, most of all, as a man with a big heart for others, always seeking ways to help those who had less in life.

He was noble and outstanding, indeed, and also so much more. I may have only 25 percent of his chromosomes but I’d take that any day.

Thank you, Upsilon, for the honor bestowed on Jorge Gonzales. Our family is also grateful to Ambassador Jesus Yabes ’66 and Bill Agustin ’58, chairman of the UNO search committee, for believing in our beloved patriarch.

The only other posthumous awardee was Ferdinand Marcos Sr. President BBM received the award on behalf of the First Family. Former first lady Imelda Marcos and daughter Irene Marcos-Araneta also graced the awarding ceremony held last Feb. 8.

Romy Carlos ’63, a celebrated artist; Ernesto de Castro ’64, a notable figure in civil and structural engineering; Steven Mascardo Yuvienco ’67, founding chairman and later president of Upsilon Sigma Phi North America; Renato Tayag Jr. ’67, an environmentalist; Jesus Crispin Remulla ’79, Secretary of Justice; Robert Lester Aranton ’81, UP Alumni Regent and current president of the UP Alumni Association; Romeo Thaddeus Liamzon Jr. ’81, a visionary in real estate development; Fernando Sanchez Jr. ‘84, former Chancellor of UPLB; Ferdinand Martin Romualdez ’85, Speaker of the House of Representatives; Alan Gerard Austriaco ’86; a respected ophthalmologist and Cary Landingin Calimlim ‘93, a veterinarian and entrepreneur.",0

Whichever one’s purpose is, motels remain resilient in the Philippines, signaling a strong recovery after the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Business is busiest on Valentine’s Day and the days before and after.

A worker in a motel told The STAR that Valentine’s Day, Feb. 14, is reserved for legitimate partners or spouses while Feb. 13 and Feb. 15 are for their paramours.

With their thick walls, mirrors on the ceiling, the privacy they offer and a wide array of themed rooms – Taylor Swift Eras Tour room, anyone? – motels in the country have been the setting for some of the most passionate lovemaking or just hot, sweaty sex.

Motels, whose name originates from the 1925 motor hotel or a hotel for motorists called the Milestone MoTel in California, are mostly for travelers in the United States. It’s a type of hotel with no central lobby and each room is accessed from its own private garage.

In the Philippines, however, this so-called drive-in feature – direct access to rooms from a parking area with a rolling garage door that closes in seconds the moment guests park – provides the privacy some of the forbidden lovers so badly need.

Indeed, according to past surveys, seven out of 10 couples who check into a motel are illicit lovers, among the biggest ironies in this predominantly Catholic country with a history of 500 years of Christianity.

One can’t help but wonder why divorce continues to be met with stiff opposition in Congress despite the prevalence of illicit affairs.

Because of the unique proposition they offer, motels in the Philippines remain resilient and continue to thrive.

Around Metro Manila, the famous motel strips – Malate, Sta. Mesa, Pasig – are still where they have always been, even as property developers have long been eyeing these prime locations.

New themed rooms
These motels, however, also do their part in keeping up with the times by expanding their product offerings.

Hotel Ava, a rebrand of Victoria Court, said business is still thriving despite being in the industry for decades already.

“Even though we rebranded recently, we have many regular guests who keep coming back to us for the price, experience and service,” Erika Christine Balanon, marketing manager of Hotel Ava, told The STAR in an interview.

There are also many motel “virgins” or first-time motel goers, who drive the market.

“The curiosity to try a motel is still there, as we continue to attract many new guests who are first-time motel goers.”

Hotel Ava, which rebranded more than 300 Victoria Court rooms, constantly innovates its products. Led by CEO Angie King, Hotel Ava is a rebrand of Victoria Court motels in Malate, Cuneta and Gil Puyat.

The rest of the Victoria Court properties, which still use the original name, are headed by Angie’s brother Atticus.

“Every year, we strive to offer new themed rooms to the  market that we know our guests will love. For example, we have an Eras Tour-inspired room, complete with a karaoke machine where Swiftie guests can sing their favorite Taylor Swift songs,” Balanon said.

Another popular themed room is the King’s Garage for car enthusiasts and inspired by Angie’s passion for cars.

The King’s Garage features a refurbished car as a bed.

“Our Marvel and Star Wars-inspired rooms are still available to those who want to fulfill their superhero fantasies,” she said, adding that each room is designed to give guests a unique experience.

Through the decades, the biggest market of motels is still couples looking for a romantic and quick stay.

But Hotel Ava also attracts groups of friends or barkadas looking for a private party space, to celebrate a birthday, a bachelor or a bachelorette party or just a karaoke night.

Focus on sustainability
As a business, Hotel Ava also focuses on sustainability.

“In addition to these, we also have sustainability projects that we believe will help the community and make our operations more efficient for our guests. Our employees are also sent to various training programs to improve their skills and better serve our guests,” Balanon said.

The motels business, indeed, continues to thrive, despite the times, despite inflation and despite the elevated prices of goods.

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority’s 2022 Annual Survey of Philippine Business and Industry published in September last year, revenue from short term accommodations which include motels amounted to P110.85 billion in 2022, from P66.12 billion in 2021. The PSA defines this class as hotels, motels, resort hotels, condotels, inns, guesthouses and youth hostels.

But it’s not all about love and sex in motels.

In some of the cheaper motels, abortionists perform abortions to those in need, despite the practice being illegal in the country; some journalists who need to interview a source or a key witness do it in motels, together with their recorders or camera. In the past, there were police interrogations too in these dingy rooms.

Unfortunately, in some instances, there are also suicides.

Once upon a time, in January 1986, a 21-year old “checked into a downtown motel, ordered a beer and then fired a bullet into his temple, according to a Reuters report published on May 21, 1989.

“We learned later it was his birthday and he and his sweetheart had quarreled,” the report quoted a waiter in the motel as saying.",0
117,Iris Gonzales,"There are a lot of things and services that many of our unfortunate fellow Filipinos do not have access to – from quality education to proper health care.

As is usually the case, they are able to avail themselves of these social services but in poor quality – from expired vaccines in barangay health centers to classrooms that leak when the rains come. If the problem isn’t expired vaccines, there are many others – a lack of qualified barangay health workers, ill-equipped centers and government hospitals.

It’s also not uncommon to see classes being held in ankle-deep floods in some parts of our country – both teachers and young boys and girls, carrying on with the lessons despite the flooding. When there is no rain, the problems include crowded classrooms, lack of facilities and supplies, a shortage of qualified teachers and many more. Many of these problems are in the EDCOM II report.

All these inadequacies strip Filipinos of the dignity they deserve. Each of us deserves to live a dignified life.

Dignity is the state or quality of being worthy of honor or respect. This means that as citizens, we must be accorded the social services which the Constitution mandates us to have with honor and respect. This includes the right to dignified education and health care.

One of my first assignments as a rookie journalist was to cover a cancer-stricken man who was dying in a hospital room in a government hospital in Quezon City. The room had seen better days. I remember noticing the broken windows, the dilapidated bed and the miserable charity ward. At the center of it all was the 69-year-old patient who was wasting away, waiting for death to come.

My story was published on Nov. 12, 1999. I’m sure that government hospital has had little improvement, if any, especially with the chronic underfunding of our health budget.

Here in our country, our leaders care very little about dignity, if it’s even on their mind.

If they did, they wouldn’t let our children study in classrooms that aren’t decent or conducive enough to learning. In some far-flung villages in the country, we let them walk miles and miles to school, often in worn-out shoes, because believe it or not, some areas still can’t be reached by vehicles. This is no thanks to local executives and lawmakers who steal the money meant for these roads.

If they did, they wouldn’t allow our people to get health care in hospitals that have seen better days – hospitals where you might get sicker than better because their facilities are dilapidated, worn-out and ill-equipped to handle the latest medical needs.

If they did, they wouldn’t let our people find shelter in the sidewalks or dark nooks and crannies of Metro Manila or in hodgepodge makeshift homes in maze-like slums that are teeming with poverty. They wouldn’t let them relocate in areas so far from civilization, when developers have bulldozed their shanties to make way for condos and resorts.

If they did, they wouldn’t allow them to walk along dizzying and elevated walkways along EDSA just to get to the train station or to cross to the other side for a bus ride home.

And do you remember the Dolomite Beach along Manila Bay?

That for me was one concrete example of government action that stripped citizens of dignity.

Sure, that fake white sand beach was beautiful but it was merely opium, with a nearly P400-million tab. It was a distraction, like barbiturates in our veins to make us forget what we really needed at the time when that magically appeared. That was during the COVID-19 pandemic and Filipinos, facing growing anxiety and mental health problems, were looking for concrete solutions.

But that was nothing but a band-aid solution. The masses were fooled into believing they could finally enjoy a stroll on the beach and experience white sand between their toes. But that was not even the real thing. It was dolomite. Our leaders couldn’t even give them a real beach.

Where’s the dignity in that?

The Kantian platitude
The early modern concept of dignity, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, originates with Immanuel Kant, who in his 1785 Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, argued that all persons have an inherent value, or dignity by virtue of their rational autonomy.

This value commands a distinct kind of moral respect, which we express by abiding by certain limits in our treatment of others. Thus, Kant argued that we have a categorical duty to treat persons always “as an end” and “never merely as a means.”

In more recent decades, the United Nations formally established inherent dignity in the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights, affirming the “inherent dignity” and “equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family” as the “foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.”

I think about dignity now because the campaign period has officially commenced. And as in previous elections, our people will be promised the moon and the stars, and kisses all they want.

They may be given kilos of rice and a few cans of sardines or packs of noodles for their crucial votes but we, the people, deserve so much more than that.

We need housing, education, public health and employment. But most of all, we need leaders who will treat Filipinos with dignity – not as crucial votes to be bought with a few pesos and a song.",0
118,Iris Gonzales,"Remember that day when what seemed impossible happened? On Sept. 16, 1991, history unfolded in the Philippine Senate.

The chamber unexpectedly voted against the proposed US bases treaty, which would have given the US another 10 years to maintain its military presence at Subic Naval Base in the Philippines.

It was a historic vote, decided by a slim 12-11 margin. The 12 senators, who would later be known as the “Magnificent Twelve,” were Agapito “Butz” Aquino, Joseph Estrada, Teofisto Guingona Jr., Sotero Laurel II, Ernesto Maceda, Orlando Mercado, Aquilino Pimentel Jr., Rene Saguisag, Jovito Salonga, Wigberto Tañada, Victor Ziga and Juan Ponce Enrile.

These men put aside their personal biases and voted for the nation’s interest. Some of them were statesmen through and through.

That decision put an end to the US military bases in the country, which were considered a big part of our colonial past.

Shining moment
I think about this chamber’s defining hour back then. From the Senate that said “no” in 1991 for nationalist reasons, we now have a Senate that also said “no” to the impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte – but clearly not for nationalist reasons. Perhaps this is more about political interest.

For many, the Senate’s decision not to act immediately on the VP’s impeachment was a complete disappointment.

We saw the crowd that gathered last month at EDSA, calling for VP Duterte’s impeachment. Sure, it wasn’t anything like EDSA I or II, but there was a big crowd nonetheless.

A December 2024 survey conducted by Social Weather Stations showed that 41 percent of Filipinos support Duterte’s impeachment. Some 35 percent were opposed and 19 percent were undecided. The survey, conducted from Dec. 12 to 18, involved 2,160 respondents and has a margin of error of ±2.

Among socio-economic classes, support for impeachment is strongest in Classes ABC, where 50 percent agree with the impeachment complaint, according to Stratbase.

This isn’t surprising, given the revelations surrounding the VP, including the use of confidential funds and, after the hearings, her threats of violence.

What happens next?
The Senate has adjourned and will resume on June 2, by which time a new set of 12 senators will have been elected.

Against this backdrop, there’s no telling how things will unfold.

Senate President Francis Escudero has been firm in saying that the chamber cannot be rushed. He also said the Constitution’s provision on impeachment does not use the word “immediately” but “forthwith.”

Says the Constitution: “…and trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed.”

But what does “forthwith” mean? In the dictionary, it means “immediately, without delay,” especially in official use.

Maybe it would be better for the Senate President to just say that the Senate chooses not to proceed yet, even if it can.

There’s a lot at stake, after all. Perhaps the senators are well aware that this is a slippery slope they don’t want to navigate right now.

There are quite a number of pro-Duterte senators in the chamber, and some re-electionists also want to be spared from the consequences of their decision.

Perhaps this is also a matter of horse-trading. Senator Chiz wants to spare the senators from being put in a tight spot, a leverage he can later use in winning his colleagues’ support in his bid to retain the Senate presidency after the polls.

Politics, after all, is a game of compromises.

In the end, however, the Senate – under Senate President Escudero’s leadership – will have to answer to the people.

Whatever happened to the Senate as an institution? Has it become a spineless chamber?

In the past, the Senate has delivered bold decisions that once seemed impossible. Senators of decades past were true statesmen who prioritized the public good over their own interests.

Even former senator Leila de Lima reminded her former colleagues that the Senate can function as an impeachment court even outside of regular sessions.

“Kahit walang regular session kasi yung impeachment, hindi ito yung ordinary legislative function ng Kongreso. Ito ay isang non-legislative function, special function ng Kongreso,” De Lima said in an interview with TeleRadyo.

The former senator also said that Congress has done its part, and it is now up to the Senate to continue the process.

She also said that the Senate constituting itself as an impeachment court is an “obligation” imposed by the Constitution.

Former senator Franklin Drilon was likewise quoted as saying that a special session is necessary to start the process.

Even retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio said President Marcos can call a special session for the impeachment trial. He also said that while waiting, plunder charges could be filed against the VP.

For now, we’ll have to wait and see what happens next.

What is certain is that the VP was impeached by 215 congressmen, acting on complaints that were based on the findings of the hearings and public statements Duterte herself made.

With or without an impeachment trial, the VP must address the issues raised against her, especially because taxpayers’ money is involved.",0
119,Iris Gonzales,"It’s been two years since the death of tycoon Roberto V. Ongpin or RVO, who died in 2023, cradled in the arms of his beloved Balesin.

On Wednesday, Feb. 5, there was a memorial mass commemorating his second death anniversary at Alphaland Makati Place which, just like Balesin, is among his well-loved projects.

Unfortunately, I was out of town that day so I missed the event. I am usually away on Feb. 5 because that day happens to be a loved one’s birthday. In fact, when I heard the news of his death that cold February morning in 2023, I was in Baguio, supposedly celebrating a happy time. But I remembered being really stunned and sad when I heard the news of his passing that early morning. That moment, Baguio’s weather just became colder. RVO, to me, was not just a good and brilliant source but a friend with a great sense of humor.

Last week, I was in Cavite and could not be there for his mass. RVO would not have taken no for an answer. I imagine him, pestering me from the grave with his stern voice: “Hey, come back to Manila now and attend my memorial mass!”

That’s RVO. He was personal like that. He would call people or write to us himself when he wanted to share something or needed something. Or sometimes, he simply wanted to invite us over to share some of his finest drinks or good food and talk about the crazy political environment in our country.

He knew a lot about the country and played a big role in our society during nearly every pivotal chapter – from Marcos Sr. to Marcos Jr.

Before he died, he wrote his memoirs, but as he told me before, it would only be published after he had kicked the bucket and perhaps, when some people he wrote about had too. Let’s wait and see.

I may have missed his memorial mass but RVO is always in my thoughts and prayers. When our political environment gets crazier, I often wonder what he would have said. Just like now, would he have supported the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte? Or would he have tried to stop it? He had friends in Congress. Would he have persuaded them to do this or that? What would he say to his friend –(or protégé?) Senate President Chiz Escudero?

RVO was a quiet power player, even without trying. He was a man who knew his worth.

At some point, as Marcos Sr.’s trade minister, he had a good vision for the country, identifying local industries we needed to develop. Had RVO’s vision come to life, we would be first world now and better equipped to face today’s trade challenges. Cronyism and politics, sadly, got in the way.

His Binondo Central Bank helped save the economy at a crucial time. His businesses, now helmed by his nephew Eric Recto, remain an important part of the country’s business landscape.

RVO, “unretirable” as he was, would have wanted to do more.

But he did what he could during his time on earth, and boy, did he enjoy it, too. His legacy lives on and will not be forgotten.

Populist
Speaking of Congress, traders are urging our lawmakers to reconsider the proposed P200 daily wage hike.

Businessmen from the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc. (FFCCCII) said that while they recognize the need for meaningful wage adjustments to help workers cope with rising costs of living, they also hope that the proposal considers the welfare of businesses and the economy as a whole.

Instead of a legislated wage hike, wage-setting should consider regional conditions, FFCCCII said.

“Rather than a blanket nationwide wage increase, wage-setting should consider regional economic conditions. The cost of living varies significantly across the country, and a uniform P200 hike may disproportionately affect businesses in lower-cost regions, leading to closures and job losses.

“Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards composed of labor, business and government representatives are in the best position to determine fair and sustainable wage adjustments based on local realities,” according to FFCCCII president Dr. Cecilio Pedro.

Economic realities
I also talked to other businesses, especially the smaller ones, and they, too, raised concerns on a legislated wage increase.

“At a time of global economic volatility and high borrowing costs, imposing a drastic wage hike could worsen economic conditions. A P200 increase could trigger higher prices, job cuts or business closures – hitting hardest the 84 percent of workers in the informal sector.

“If wages rise too high unilaterally and too drastically, we, the businesses here in the Philippines, might lose our global competitiveness... More MSMEs might suffer and many workers may even face retrenchment.”

Progressive lawmakers will dismiss this as selfish business interests but our present-day realities would show that indeed, small businesses will definitely be hurt from a P200 daily wage hike.

This isn’t surprising though, given that it’s election season and our lawmakers tend to embrace populist moves.

An increase in wages is surely justified but the amount must take into consideration all stakeholders.

The FFCCCII said there must be a balance in safeguarding workers’ welfare and business viability.

“As our 70th anniversary slogan states: ‘Dugong Tsino, Pusong Pinoy’ – we seek to uplift workers’ lives while safeguarding business viability and Philippine economic resilience.”",0
120,Iris Gonzales,"Did you know that many of our Filipino youth are dropping out of college and instead opting to earn a living right away for their families?

It’s even worse in Mindanao, with higher education attrition rates reaching as high as 93.4 percent recorded in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

This is as alarming as it can get, and it’s among the disturbing findings of the Second Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM II), a national commission tasked with evaluating the performance of the Philippine education sector.

I’ve always believed that education is a step toward building a better future for oneself and one’s country. Education opens doors and opportunities, and each and every Filipino must have access to it.

The right education can help lift families out of poverty; we’ve seen success stories of some of the country’s tycoons who were products of state universities or were given scholarships to private schools.

Education can spell the difference between surviving and thriving. And yet, it’s not just that. It’s about experiencing the joys of learning, which are magical, cathartic and beautiful.

Sadly, many of today’s youth won’t get a chance at that because poverty is forcing them out of college. Many of them have to be breadwinners early in life to send their young siblings to school because their parents’ earnings aren’t enough.

It is a cultural and economic problem.

Says EDCOM II:

“While higher education participation rate in the country is high at 34.89 percent, this remains lower than the ASEAN average of 41.10 percent. This also varies significantly across regions, with BARMM (18.7 percent), Bicol (24.6 percent) and Central Luzon (25.1 percent) having much lower rates.

“Studies find that the top deterrents to pursuing higher education today are employment/looking for work (44.17 percent), lack of personal interest (24.94 percent) and financial limitations (20.98 percent).”

Likewise, the attrition rates are equally disturbing.

“Higher education attrition rates are alarmingly high: at 39 percent nationally but reaching 93.4 percent in BARMM, followed by Region VII (60.7 percent), Region IX (59.5 percent) and CAR (54.9 percent).”

What to do then?

EDCOM II underscores the need for CHED to closely monitor and understand the factors contributing to severe dropouts and to initiate programs to address attrition.

Free higher education in state universities and colleges and local universities and colleges has improved participation, although I personally believe that government interventions must be targeted instead of a free-for-all setup where rich kids end up crowding out the poorest of the poor in some state universities.

DSWD data show at least 683,822 college-eligible students from Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program families could benefit from the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES).

However, reductions in TES – to P10,000 from P60,000 – may push the poorest students out of college, affect student completion rates and limit program choices.

EDCOM II warns that this may force the poorest students to forego higher education. Further, it would only realistically allow them to choose from five courses on average, most of which are already oversubscribed. These include Elementary Education, Technology and Livelihood Education, Criminology, Industrial Technology and Technical Education.

Thus, EDCOM II recommends restoring the original subsidy of P60,000 for TES grantees to support successful completion.

It also recommends providing additional incentives for those pursuing government-identified priority programs.

Teacher education
Another problematic area, as pointed out by EDCOM II, is the inadequate education that teachers receive.

Did you know that 62 percent of high school teachers are teaching subjects outside their college major?

“This misalignment between pre-service training and school-level needs undermines the quality of instructional expertise in the basic education system,” according to the report.

Not surprisingly, the mismatch is more pronounced in the sciences.

“The problem is particularly pronounced in the sciences, with a 98 percent mismatch in the physical sciences and an 80 percent mismatch in the biological sciences, highlighting a critical gap in subject-specific expertise.”

Furthermore, 13 percent and 16 percent of science teachers, respectively, teach science outside their specialization.

The teacher education curriculum requires only a minimum of six units each for field studies and practice teaching, which is among the shortest practice teaching requirements in the world.

I’m not sure when or how we got into this situation.

But one thing is certain – we need to act fast to arrest this decline.

The Department of Education must revisit teacher quality and training.

Teachers’ salaries
It is also time to raise the salary of teachers and create a system where there is room for career advancement.

“It takes teachers 15 years to move from Teacher 1 (Salary Grade 11 at P27,000) to Teacher 3 (Salary Grade 13 at P31,320),” EDCOM II said.

As it is now, teachers move to administrative roles for higher pay, further reducing the presence of experienced educators in classrooms.

A great teacher can spell the difference between success and failure in life. The least we can do for our children is to ensure that they get the best teachers.

From teachers to classroom shortages to rising incidence of college dropouts and many other problems in between, there is no doubt that our crisis in education is a ticking time bomb.

This crisis is a testament to what happens when taxpayers’ money meant for education is corrupted with impunity.",0
121,Maria A. Ressa,"Why does someone risk their life, their freedom, to fight for the rights of others? 

That kept going around my head while on a video call on December 19 with eight women Nobel peace laureates, brought together by the temporary release from prison of 52-year-old Narges Mohammedi, Nobel Peace Prize, Iran, 2023. 

Hello, I’m Maria Ressa, and I’m one of the 4 co-founders of Rappler. I received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, making Rappler the only fully functioning Nobel newsroom today. During this emotional call, Rappler was having our Christmas party, and I actually showed Narges and the Nobel women our office and our team, who at that moment were singing “Defying Gravity” (the theme of the night).  Which is exactly what Narges has been through: “arrested 13 times, convicted five times and sentenced to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes,” said the Nobel committee. Jailed in Iran’s notorious Evin prison, she was released for 21 days in December for an operation to remove a tumor. When she was wheeled out, she carried a picture of Mahsa Amini, and yelled, “Women. Life. Freedom.”

Despite the looming end of her freedom, Narges was smiling and resolute. We spoke about gender apartheid, mass executions, protests, wars — how could we not with Jody Williams (1997, United States), Shirin Ebadi (2003, Iran), Leymah Gbowee (2011, Liberia), (Tawakkol Karman (2011, Yemen), Malala Yousafzai (2014, Pakistan), and Oleksandra Matviichuk (2022, Center for Civil Liberties, Ukraine) on the call. 

BUT we also spoke about perseverance, about helping each other, about commitment, about love. When you’re on the front lines, you celebrate every win.

World is worse than you think
It almost seems like these qualities underlying the courage of the women on the call — hard work, empathy, the values behind the world’s major religions (in Christianity, “do unto others as you would have them do unto you”) — have gone out of style. Everyone wants quick rewards, the dopamine high of popularity (leading to populism at scale). 

The world is turned upside down by the perverse incentive structure of the technology that connects us all: when lies laced with fear, anger and hate pound open the sensitive fracture lines of our societies, for profit. That system of “engagement” and microtargeting is the most powerful tool of manipulation of those seeking and maintaining power. When politicians use it, it’s information operations; when nations use it, it’s information warfare — and it is reshaping the world. 

It’s worse than you think: the new “axis” — Russia, China, Iran and North Korea — are united by their grievances against the West, especially after sanctions largely failed after Russia invaded Ukraine, and helped bring them together. With the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Sudan, Myanmar, and our ongoing near-daily confrontations in the West Philippine Sea, it’s increasingly clear that conflicts around the world are interconnected. Look at Syria, Serbia, Venezuela, or North Korean troops fighting for Russia in Ukraine. 

Another complication: Russia, China, and North Korea already possess nuclear weapons, while Iran may only be weeks away from a nuclear breakthrough if it were to aggressively pursue it. Are we already in World War III?

Elections are manipulated
My latest book, How to Stand up to a Dictator, has been translated into about 25 languages, including Mongolian, Georgian and Romanian. I was in Tbilisi, Georgia, earlier this year and listened to its citizens prepare to fight a Russian-style foreign agents law. As I write this, more than 200,000 Georgians have been out on the streets for nearly a month demanding new elections, protesting for its democratic values. (Add Venezuela, Mozambique, and many others in these electoral protests.) 

Shortly before that, in Romania, its Constitutional Court voided elections after a little known candidate without a political party and supported by the Kremlin’s information operations on TikTok took first place in its run-off elections. This is the first and most decisive move any nation has taken against the information warfare social media has enabled since 2016. 

As I have said repeatedly for years now, we cannot have election integrity with the manipulation of our emotions enabled by social media. Nerve’s latest report before the US elections shows exactly what can happen: the manipulation of the youth, the weaponization of race and gender, among them.

This new “axis” — what Anne Applebaum called Autocracy, Inc — is not united in any political ideology – only pulled together in its thirst for power and money. It begins in the public information ecosystem. The global trend in 2024, the super-election year (74 national elections globally, with the last one taking place December 29 in Chad) shows democracy losing: we started the year with 71% of the world now under autocratic rule, and while some in media see election results as a failure of incumbents in 10 major countries (the first time this has ever happened in almost 120 years), those of us who have lived through this (and survived) see this as the success of insidious voter manipulation on social media.

What Rappler is doing
Over the last decade, we at Rappler have dealt with and become frustrated by analysis paralysis. The attacks we lived through and our data analysis since 2014 pushed us to the forefront of the fight for information integrity.

Our journalism remains the same: investigative reports that hold power to account. Read and watch our best in 2024. We learned that the form and substance of journalism is not enough. It needs to be coupled with the best of what technology has to offer — to reimagine what technology could do without surveillance capitalism.

What would a public interest tech stack look like that brings trusted information to our communities, the citizens in our democracy? If we succeeded, could we stitch together a global community — with news organizations as tent pegs in a global federation?

In 2020, we launched Lighthouse: its movements feature allowed us to bring some partners and NGOs into our tech stack. In 2022, we began creating a PH-wide data lake with an ontology, knowledge graph, and vectorDB to allow generative AI to automate creation of pages anchored on facts. In mid-2023 after OpenAI launched its chatbot, we zoomed GPT-4 onto each story page and created a 3 bullet-point summary of every Rappler story. 

Around that time, we were one of 10 from 1000 global groups selected by OpenAI to use its chatbot for democratic consultation (aiDialogue). Working with the Quezon City local government, we began to finetune AI use for public consultations. It was exciting to think of the ability to widen democratic participation in a more systematic manner. 

Finally, a year ago, we launched Rappler Communities, a matrix protocol chat app that allows real people to have real conversations in a shared reality essential for any democracy. At this existential moment for news, we’ve created an MVP not only for survival but which we believe will allow news to thrive with a sustainable business model in a global public information ecosystem anchored in facts. 

Don’t be overwhelmed 
Our times demand you act. Choose and build the world you want. 

We can’t begin to work on solutions for climate change unless we agree on the problem. Leaders can’t govern until we begin to bring nuance and complexity back into the public domain. The good in each of us can’t emerge until we restore an environment of trust. That can’t happen if each of us is being insidiously manipulated. 

So download and join our community: first in the Philippines, followed by Indonesia, South Africa, and Brazil. Try our new RAI — what generative AI looks like if you want to anchor in facts! If you’re a news group that wants to join, let us know. If you’re a funder who wants a systemic solution, help us build. 

I’ve learned a lot in the years we’ve been under attack. In 2019, we created the International Fund for Public Interest Media to help bring new money to news groups. In 2021, we created a whole of society distribution system for facts — #FactsFirstPH in partnership with the Google News Initiative (parts of which were replicated in other parts of the world). In 2022, I became the vice chair of the leadership panel of the UN’s Internet Governance Forum to try to understand the multilateral system, and in 2023, I accepted the chair of the World Movement for Democracy to understand how human rights and civil society groups work together. Each of these taught me lessons in governance as well as showing me why our world today is broken.

The year ahead
We’re at a global inflection point, and 2025 will push us to a tipping point for violence, for fascism. Or not. It depends on what each of us does now.

So don’t be overwhelmed. Don’t be depressed. Don’t disengage. 

Instead, take the four action points I recommend from the last speech I gave in 2024, my first in a Jewish temple in front of Muslims, Christians, Palestinians — a truly interfaith and diverse community of young and old alike. Religion and faith are crucial parts of our world views. It’s why I will return to the Vatican in January to help Pope Francis kick off the Jubilee, which happens once every 25 years. 

Hope for a better future comes from action, from perseverance. And faith. That’s what the Nobel Women showed me. That’s why we risk our freedom and dedicate our lives to fighting for all our rights.",0
122,Maria A. Ressa,"We can allow the fracture lines in our society to break open. Or we can work to heal the growing divides. 
The time we spent together last night was so special because despite our differences, we shared a space where we all felt safe. Sadly, this isn’t the world we live in today. But last night proved it doesn’t take much to create it; all it needs is our collective will and our empathy. 

In the last few weeks, I’ve been to Reyjkavik, a gathering of more than 400 women leaders led by Iceland’s female president, to Johannesburg, where 600 civil rights leaders gathered to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the end of apartheid, and to Cape Town, to deliver the Desmond Tutu lecture on the 40th anniversary of his peace prize. 

In a 4-hour meeting in Nelson Mandela’s house, as chair of the World Movement for Democracy, I heard bleak assessments of democracy around the world from our steering committee: of the rise of the far right globally; how we are electing illiberal leaders democratically (as of early this year, for example, V-Dem said that 71% of the world is now under autocratic rule); how 2024, the tipping point year for elections — when about half the world voted — may have set the stage for the end of democracy. 

From Venezuela, Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Mozambique to South Korea, which declared martial law and then rescinded it … to France, which just lost its prime minister, to Georgia, which has had 10 days of violent protests. At least 500 arrested, friends are now saying 270, many journalists, were beaten brutally by government thugs. For years now, I’ve shown data in different countries around the world that technology is the match that set the world’s dry kindling on fire. Move fast, break things, said Mark Zuckerberg — and Big Tech broke democracy. 

I learned that the fracture lines of society pounded open are the same regardless of country or culture. The main two are gender and race — and the attacks are fueled by religion. Sexism that turns into misogyny; and racism that finds its way into constitutions like Hungary, where it’s called white replacement theory. You’ll hear it in the news as immigration or inflation, but dig deeper, and you will see gender and race. 

When I turn on the news, it almost feels like we’re already in World War III — from the trenches of Ukraine to the rubble of Gaza and the forgotten battlegrounds of Sudan, Myanmar, until recently, Syria and many other invisible conflicts around the world. But these are wars fought not just with missiles and tanks, but with algorithms, disinformation, and the systematic destruction of truth. 

Big Tech — from American companies in Silicon Valley to China’s TikTok — transformed social media from a tool of connection into a weapon of mass behavioral engineering. These platforms are not neutral technologies; they are sophisticated systems designed to exploit our deepest psychological vulnerabilities. They monetize our outrage and hate; amplify our divisions; and systematically erode our capacity for nuanced thinking and empathy. 

In 2018, MIT said that lies spread 6 times faster on social media. You tell a lie a million times, it becomes a fact. 

Betrayal of human dignity
Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without these three, we don’t have a shared reality, let alone solve existential problems like climate change. We can’t have journalism; we can’t have democracy. The business model of Big Tech — surveillance capitalism — is built on a fundamental betrayal of human dignity — where data privacy has become a myth, and AI and algorithms have cloned and manipulated us: 

Creating echo chambers that exacerbate existing biases;
Prioritizing conflict over understanding; 
Monetizing human attention at the expense of social cohesion. 
This is not an accident. It is a deliberate design that brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year to these companies. 

In this world, people of faith have a critical role that goes beyond individual belief. Your congregations, your interfaith networks, your community organizations are not just sanctuaries of spiritual reflection – they are — like journalists — the frontline defenders of our shared democratic values. 

In my book, How to Stand Up to a Dictator, I write about how the golden rule. “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” has guided me throughout my life. 

It helped define courage for me in a world increasingly shaped by lies: the courage to speak when silence is safer; the courage to build bridges when walls seem easier; and the courage to stand for truth even when it feels like the entire world is against you. 

I like the South African word ubuntu — “I am because we are” — an antidote to many of our problems today. It’s a universal truth that our faith communities embody. The pain of one is the pain of all. When Big Tech rewards the worst of who we are, UBUNTU teaches us that our fates are interconnected; that the fight for truth, justice, and peace is not someone else’s battle; it is ours. 

So what can you do? I have 4 suggestions:

Collaborate, collaborate, collaborate. Build and strengthen trust now to close the fracture lines of society that information operations will try to pound open, pitting us against each other.
2. Speak truth with moral clarity. Silence in the face of injustice is complicity. Whether it’s systemic racism, economic inequality, or the erosion of democratic norms, people of faith must reclaim their prophetic voice. Demand transparency and accountability from those who control our public information ecosystems — from governments to Big Tech to media.
Protect the Most Vulnerable. Support journalists, human rights defenders and activists who risk their lives. Remember the Martin Neimoller quote from Germany? Here’s our PH version — published by our largest newspaper after my first arrest: “First they came for the journalists. We don’t know what happened next.” Your networks can be powerful shields for marginalized communities. Support immigrants, religious minorities, the LGBTQ+ and others who face discrimination. Your collective vigilance can prevent the normalization of hate. 
Recognize Your Power. Building peace is not reserved for heroes; it’s the collective work of people who refuse to accept and live lies. Rappler would not have survived without the help of our community, always reminding me of the goodness of human nature. You are powerful and can be part of a tidal wave of change for the good. 
Let me repeat them: collaborate, collaborate, collaborate; speak truth with moral clarity; protect the most vulnerable; and recognize your power. 

Even at the worst of times, hope is not passive; it’s active, relentless and strategic. Our faith traditions carry centuries of resilience; we need to share those stories of transformation. 

There’s this TS Eliot quote I love about “the present moment of the past.” It’s the idea that the latest novel you read is affected by the fact that you read Shakespeare, but your understanding and appreciation of Shakespeare will be affected by the latest novel that you read. 

In this present moment of our shared past, we have a choice — and it will create our future as much as change how we look at our past. We can allow the fracture lines in our society to break open. Or we can work to heal the growing divides. 

Because this is it. This time matters. What you choose to do matters.",0
123,Maria A. Ressa,"What will survive in the age of machines? Investigative journalism built on an ecosystem of federated news organizations anchored on facts.
It’s bleak. Given present trends, the death of the news business can happen within a year or two, directly linked to the corruption of the public information ecosystem enabled by Big Tech. 

This year, we’re already seeing massive layoffs, and it’s expected to get worse. I sit on the board of several news organizations, two of them American, and drops in both revenue and distribution (which for digital news are connected) continue. This acceleration seemed triggered by the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT and the succeeding arms race for generative AI. Predictably, Big Tech pushed generative AI, and even journalism schools, foundations and NGOs are encouraging quick adoption without realizing that we’re again committing the same mistake we did by putting the share button on our websites. We’re taking Big Tech at face value, falling for its hype and lobbying – and, again, giving these companies our data and relationships. 

Bloomberg took an expensive approach: use open source LLM (or large language models) then train it on your data. Moat it so that other LLMs won’t be able to use your output as training data. It brings its own problems, aside from the cost. Rappler did what we could afford, and in June 2023, we rolled out our first experiment with generative AI: adding a three-bullet point summary for every article on our site.

By then we began to fear that Big Tech was going to cut off the distribution of news.

What’s clear is that journalism won’t survive if we don’t build our own tech. 

There are only three ways a website gets traffic: direct, social, and search. Generative AI search was clear with Bing, sparking the search war. Google soon began experiments publicly and rolled out SGE, Search Generative Experience, in 125 countries, including the United States and the Philippines. (While many of the companies rolling out LLMs said that news groups could opt out, it was impossible to do that with SGE and Google: it built its LLM on top of search so if a news group opted out, it would disappear from the internet.) 

By Q1 2023, it became clear that search, which brings 60-69% of Rappler traffic, could disappear. That same quarter, social media referrals dropped without any warning.

Falling off the cliff
Elon Musk bought Twitter in late October 2022. Within a month, he was announcing policy decisions publicly and changing his mind as quickly. He was doxing critics on the platform and brigading, and by January 2023, he dissolved Twitter’s Trust & Safety Council and later fired his trust & safety team. 

In January 2023, Facebook/Meta, the world’s largest distributor of news, began aggressively choking traffic to news sites. Traffic fell off the cliff in May. Similarweb data showed that by August 2023, global Facebook referral traffic to the top 30 news sites was down 62%. News sites like the Guardian and Business Insider dropped up to 80%. Buzzfeed declined 72% then, perhaps contributing to its decision to shut down its news group.

What Rappler did
We decided to build our own technology, connecting a chat app directly to our news feed. We built it on the Matrix protocol, open source, secure, decentralized – and used by countries which value data privacy like Germany and France. 

Instead of throwing our community back into the toxic sludge of social media where they are insidiously manipulated, we decided to build a safe space, where real conversations and relationships can develop. 

Like Project Agos, our climate and disaster risk reduction campaign, we know we can create a positive feedback loop between government and the people that can lead to real-time action. 

This is our announcement of our quiet matrix protocol roll-out last December. Technology built by journalists is also governed by our standards & ethics manual, making our community guidelines simple.

When the trends became clear by Q1 2023, we pivoted quickly and began building community tech. In the graph below of unique users from Similarweb, you can see the top Philippine news sites: Inquirer is the top newspaper followed by PhilStar (both about 40 years old); GMANetwork is the top television station (63 years old), followed by ABS-CBN (78 years old). Rappler is 12 years old, with about 1/10th of these groups’ newsgathering resources. 

Focus on the blue line for Rappler, and you can see that it began rising in July 2023, a month after we rolled out generative AI summaries, implemented editorial shifts in form and substance – of video, unique, in-depth stories, and newsletters – moves driven by data from the user journey through our site. Our user base grew steadily as we continued our tech build and evolved our editorial processes and workflows. By November 2023, Rappler surpassed all other Philippine news groups with the largest Filipino community.  

This upward trend continued into 2024. Rappler also tops Philippine news sites in deduplicated audience (meaning across all devices). Again, this is an upward trend that started in July 2023.

What’s ahead
The race is to be able to bring our community together before the ability to trawl social media and the referral traffic from search ends. As generative AI deluges the internet with deepfakes (or synthetic media) and low-quality content, public distrust and cynicism will increase because of the lack of information integrity. That will have an impact on the behavior of people and society, and the types of governments we elect. I’ve long said: without facts, you can’t have truth; without truth, you can’t have trust. Without these, we have no shared reality, no democracy, and it becomes impossible to deal with the existential problems of our times like climate change. 

At Rappler, our community will have a safe space, where facts are clear, and constructive debate can enable the processes of a strong democracy. In the coming year, we hope to be able to connect at least four other independent news groups through our matrix protocol chat app. That federation allows us to build a global network of news bottom up – an extremely valuable community of TRUST. 

We can govern this group using a similar system as the Internet Governance Forum, without one group controlling policies and direction. That could include a quality ad network which can rival present-day ads spewed into the corrupted public landscape. Quality can win, especially if you have a global community focused on facts and the values that strengthen democracy.

In a federated system of news organizations, we can protect our data with a tech stack and execution that can help us collectively create a more sophisticated LLM, a new form of news consumption with chatbots using generative AI we can anchor on facts. 

To illustrate: in the next few months, Rappler will be finishing its ontology: building a knowledge graph that will anchor our LLM using GraphRAG to ensure the integrity of information that our chatbot delivers. This integrates the machine into the process of journalism in a way that allows machine-generated content that is anchored on facts. This is a far more labor- and time-intensive execution of a project we rolled out in 2022, when we created the first Philippine politics knowledge graph that allowed GPT3 to accurately generate nearly 50,000 pages served to a public front-end.

Generative AI could explore a wealth of possibilities that journalism hasn’t touched. Unlike past machine learning and AI, this has the ability to create, to code, to self-improve. But the difference in our execution is that it is both back-end and front-end, machine and human, and more importantly, we assure the public of fact-based, evidence-based information. 

So what is the future of news? 

When you hold power to account, it’s called journalism. 

So what will survive in the age of machines? Investigative journalism built on this ecosystem. Think fractal stories, which challenge the traditional linear narrative structure. Like hyperlinks, but far more recursive, combining (wo)man and machine. 

This approach encourages exploration and discovery, leading to greater depth and a deeper appreciation for the complexity of the human experience. This restores nuance, critical thinking, and trust back into the public sphere. And engages communities in meaningful ways.",0

It’s been a grueling week trying to understand why people fight to make things better.
 
Last Thursday, October 18, I walked into the co-working space of the Civil Media Company and the Civil Foundation in Brooklyn. Days earlier, the staff spent a sleepless night watching the close of the world’s first token sale on blockchain in search of a sustainable model for news. Without ducking, they immediately announced they had failed to reach the $8 million dollar minimum target but that they were here to stay and had learned valuable lessons for the next round.
 
Failure means TRY AGAIN.
 
I sit on the Civil Council, a small group of advisors on the Civil Constitution now being written. Later, we become a court of appeals for this open platform for ethical journalism with huge ambitions: to restore trust, remove vested interests, find a business model, and define the best future for news.

In the short time I was with them, we talked about our dreams, and I soaked up the intense energy of people who will not give up.

The backdrop is dire: the reports coming out about disinformation/computational propaganda, attacks on journalists, and deteriorating trust in social media platforms; and the unveiled lawsuit against Facebook and the allegation that it willingly misled news publishers globally about the metrics for video views, inflated by up to 900% (which Facebook denies).
 
In the Philippines, the filing of candidacies for the 2019 elections shows patronage politics is firmly entrenched with even party list seats blatantly hijacked in bids for power; and feudal families building old and new dynasties turning politics into family businesses – Marcos, Estrada, Duterte, Cayetano, Binay, Revilla, to name a few. (Read: Duterte: ‘Ayaw ko ng dynasty, but we are forced’)
 
For Rappler, our lawyers tell me two of our politically-motivated cases are coming up for a decision, and that at least one of them may carry an arrest warrant. (Thought bubble: really?! Still, I remain hopeful about the professional men and women in our judiciary who will hold the line against power.)

All these are playing out against one of the most horrific attacks against journalists – the brutal killing and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi. (Read our editorial: #AnimatED: The Jamal Khashoggi in each of us)

 

So why do we persist?

Because we must.

We are living through the creative destruction of global power structures by social media. Their “unintended consequences” destroyed democracy as we know it, helping cheap armies on social media redefine geopolitical power, elections, and the fabric of our societies.

As the US, Brazil, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines enter election season, read this Data & Society report released last week that shows how today’s digital advertising infrastructure is being weaponized by political and anti-democratic actors.
 
We have to do all we can to fix it, no matter how small, and demand transparency and reforms from the social media giants. (Read: Soldiers in Facebook’s War on Fake News are Feeling Overrun)
 
We have to fight back against power’s move to corrupt, coopt, coerce, and entice.
 
Ironically, it was Facebook and YouTube that gave me the title for today’s newsletter. Over the weekend, its algorithms somehow knew I was looking for hope and served me the story of singer/songwriter Mandy Harvey, who wrote her original “Try.”
 
With near-perfect pitch, she had always wanted to be a choir director. She became completely deaf at 18 and was forced to drop out of her music program at Colorado State University. After a period of depression, she relied on a visual tuner and muscle memory to teach herself how to make music – to sing again and to compose her own songs.

“I want to do more with my life than just give up,” she said in America’s Got Talent. “It’s not the dream that I always had,” she added. “That’s okay – because I showed up, and I did something I never believed I could do.” 

We show up.
 
We TRY. ",0
125,Maria A. Ressa,"My friends said, 'Don't go home.' It was never an option. I would face these charges head-on.
Editor’s Note: This blog was first distributed as a newsletter under “Brave New World” on Monday, December 10, 2018. To sign up for weekly Rappler newsletters, click here. On December 11, Time magazine named Maria Ressa, one of the “Guardians,” along with Jamal Khashoggi, the Capital Gazette, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. They are TIME’s Person of the Year 2018.

December 1 was a test for me.
 
I knew an arrest warrant had been issued by my government on politically motivated tax evasion charges. My flight home from Paris was leaving that day, arriving in Manila at 930 pm Sunday, half an hour after the night court closed. That meant that if I was arrested, I couldn’t file bail until Monday morning.
 
I would spend the night in jail.
 
How did I handle that? 

I prepared to spend the night in jail. I packed a change of clothes, pajamas, and a toothbrush in my carry-on. Like preparing for any war zone, you prepare for the worst, and hope for the best.
 
While friends outside the Philippines told me not to come home, that was never an option.

I am so proud of the courage and fortitude of Rappler and our supporters. Despite great odds, we continue to do the best we can, refusing to accept or bend to the abuse of power that is rolling back democracy in our country. (READ: A new weapon against press freedom in the Philippines)

I am not a radical person, in temperament and politics, but these repeated attacks were unshackling me, allowing me to speak frankly about what we are seeing first-hand.
 
Facing these ridiculous charges head-on would shine the light on the way the law has been weaponized. 

And that was exactly what I said when I got home!

I posted bail the next day, and a day after that, we filed a motion to dismiss because – among other things – we believe the court that issued the warrant doesn’t have jurisdiction over this case. (Read: Rappler to Pasig court: Tax charges ‘clear case of persecution’)

I was back in court Friday, December 7, when the judge accepted our motion, gave the Bureau of Internal Revenue 15 days to respond, and postponed my arraignment. 

In another court, however, Senator Bong Revilla, despite the evidence of bank deposits and unexplained wealth, was allowed to go free. (READ: Majority justices ‘took the cudgels’ for Revilla – dissenter)
 
This Saturday’s 4th week of protests in France brought me back to Paris, which is where I faced – and conquered – my own fears.
 
This is one of those times when you just can’t be afraid. You have to look at the worst that can happen, accept it, then move on. Do the right thing.
 
While I was thinking it through hours before boarding the flight back to Manila, I heard protestors outside my hotel – “yellow jackets” or “yellow vests” – who were intially triggered by fuel price increases to help France deal with climate change.
 
I didn’t even think. I picked up my coat, tripod, camera, and followed them into the streets.

These protests form the strongest challenge to President Emmanuel Macron, when the extreme left and the far right can find fertile ground to weaken his administration. They have been going on for about a month now, and the December 1 protests I observed were the most violent. 

According to French police, it involved about 136,000 protestors with 268 people arrested. By the time I went to the airport, I could hear the water cannons firing, sirens wailing. On my phone, I was watching cars burning.
 
These protests are different because the people behind them are decentralized: organized on social media, largely Facebook, where disinformation is also misleading and fueling the anger.

After I got back to the hotel, the decision was simple. So I went through the worst case scenario step-by-step and prepared myself mentally and packed my bags. 

We are at the tip of the arrow globally fighting for the rule of law, holding government to account.
 
Again, here are my 6 calls for action to protect democracies around the world. As for us, we’ll continue calling a spade a spade.
 
Call me naïve, but this is the Philippines I know: a country that signed on to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and where principles and values matter.

126,Maria A. Ressa,"Starting on July 23, I’ll share some of what’s important to me personally, developments here and around the world that we should be keeping track of. It is my attempt to understand the world today.
I have a favorite Yeats poem that I keep repeating every time I feel that I’m living history. The last time I recited it nearly every day was through 13 days in May of 1998, days that turned Indonesia upside down and ended nearly 32 years of Suharto’s strongman rule.

I hear it again now.

Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

The best lack all conviction, while the worst

Are full of passionate intensity.

I’m alarmed by the seemingly drastic change of values that’s been catalyzed by technology.

Seemingly overnight, Filipinos turned from defending human rights to justifying – and worse, accepting – daily murders of innocent people. Or the impunity of power – both in the public and private sectors: the lack of due process and accountability; the exponential flood of lies that’s slowly chipping away at our collective self-worth and our imperfect democracy.

One of the first advocates and users of social media for social good, I am horrified by how it has been used by autocratic governments around the world to roll back democracy and press freedom – to stifle critical voices and increase sexism and misogyny by targeting women at least 3x more.

I am saddened by how social media has changed society, creating pancake people – flat and thin on real knowledge, powered by emotion, making all of us more susceptible to disinformation, which is slowly but surely helping shift the global geopolitical power balance.

On so many fronts, I see power using scorched-earth policies to gain more power, with an utter lack of disregard for the scars their tactics leave behind.

Yet, I remain optimistic – a hope that’s based on the idea that with clarity of thought and deep study, we can find the path forward through this time of creative destruction. 





How? I don’t know.

But it begins with one – me, you … the people we love. To get to that place of solitude and contemplation backed by research and real knowledge.

Brave New World is where I write not as a journalist, but as just me – my attempt to understand the world around me, hoping to find the best way to hold on to the values that define who I am. 

Starting next Monday, July 23, I’ll share some of what’s important to me personally, developments here and around the world that we should be keeping track of.

And here’s the fun part: I want to do this on email – kind of a back-to-the-future exploration.

I’d love to hear what you think. It’s a time when we need to ask questions in a safe environment and to once again use the power of technology to build communities that build, not destroy.

127,Maria A. Ressa,"Like many, I fear that the pendulum of democracy is swinging the other way globally, enabled by social media,' says Maria Ressa when she accepted the National Democracy Institute's W. Averell Harriman Democracy Award on November 2 (US time)
We at Rappler are extremely thankful that on this day, the International Day to End Impunity Against Journalists, our work and our struggles are being recognized by the National Democratic Institute here in the United States and, just a few hours earlier, in Amsterdam by the Free Press Unlimited.

I’ve been a journalist for more than 3 decades, and as a conflict reporter, war zone correspondent, I’ve never gotten as many threats as I get now as a founder of Rappler. So you know we’re living through through a moment of history.

This is one of those moments, where the mission of journalism has never been stronger – and despite the online and the offline attacks against us, we find the courage to hold the line.

I’ve had the privilege to report on people power movements and the end of one-man authoritarian rule through much of Southeast Asia, starting with people power in the Philippines in 1986. It was an exciting time to start my career.

5-and-a-half years ago, we started Rappler with the belief that technology – social media – strengthens people power exponentially. And we rode the crest of social media adoption – growing 100 to 300% in our first few years – quickly becoming one of our country’s top online news sites. We scaled fast because of social media.

The Philippines is a Facebook country – nearly 97% of all Filipinos online (you’re talking about roughly 58 million Filipinos) 97% are on Facebook. It is our public space – one that – when Rappler began – truly strengthened democracy and empowered us. We were proof of social media for social good.

Perhaps because we lived online, we were the first to document the weaponization of social media from July to August of 2016.

Today, I watch with horror as authoritarian leaders in many countries around the world use social media’s exponential power to spread propaganda, use anger and hate, to manipulate their people and to create alternative realities.

Like many, I fear that the pendulum of democracy is swinging the other way globally, enabled by social media.

In the Philippines, the failure of elite politics to deliver democracy’s promise paved the way for the rise of Rodrigo Duterte and a drug war that’s killed thousands. I can’t give you the exact number because that certainty is also a casualty in our war for truth.

When we published our social media propaganda series in Oct 2016, we proved the online ripple, using investigative journalism to ferret out and show – for example – how 26 fake accounts can impact up to 3 million other Facebook accounts in the Philippines.

Right after that series was published, we were pounded by online attacks. For about a month, I received an average of about 90 hate messages per hour.

Data that we’ve collected in nearly two years show how disinformation was deployed by what we now call the propaganda machine.

We’re six months ahead of you: we elected our president 6 months before you did.

When a lie is said 10 times, Truth has a chance to catch up…but when it’s repeated a million times, it becomes the Truth – especially when it’s backed by online state-sponsored hate exploiting the fracture lines of society – among them in the PH, the gaps between the rich and the poor, the rural provinces against imperial Manila.

Journalists are no longer the gatekeepers to the public space. We’ve lost that role.

To the tech companies running their platforms, I appeal to you to take action – be transparent…to be accountable. You’ve built a city. Now put the traffic lights in place so that the cars don’t crash into each other. Stop the impunity.

We are seeing free speech used as an excuse for posts that incite hate and violence deployed against people like me – against the journalists, activists, and anyone perceived to be critical of government.

The excuse of free speech is being used to stifle free speech.

Rappler is not anti-government; we are not anti-Duterte. In fact, he recognizes our coverage of his campaign helped get him elected.

We’re journalists, and we will not be intimidated.

To the men and women of Rappler, good morning. This award is for your hard work, your sleepless nights, and most of all, your courage.

We will shine the light.

We will hold the line.",0
128,Maria A. Ressa,"I just appeal to people with integrity to vote for honest people, not to sell their votes'  “I hate corruption,” she said emphatically. “I’ll never, ever allow corruption to rule.”

74-year-old Conchita Carpio Morales spoke forcefully. We were in the new office of the Ombudsman of the Philippines, a position created after the 1986 people power revolt. 

In a country with weak institutions and endemic corruption, ruled by social networks and a mentality of ‘you scratch my back, I scratch yours,’ there is no tougher job than running an office charged with investigating and prosecuting officials accused of graft and corruption.

“There’s a lot of corruption in government: that’s the challenge we are facing,” she said, “People are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel – that the impossible is, after all, possible, and that crooks in government could really get punished.”

It’s a message I’ve heard her give in several public forums, including our most recent anti-corruption panel during APEC meetings in Manila in November 2015.

On February 2, 2016, the week the Ombudsman’s office released 2 key decisions affecting top officials, Morales spent about an hour and a half with Rappler to assess her performance and share her insights.

Here are some of her lessons in leadership:

1.  Create an environment that makes the impossible possible

It was the first time I visited the months old new headquarters, spartan in design. Huge imposing columns at the entrance reminded me of the Supreme Court, a stateliness that made justice seem solid and palpable. 

The downstairs lobby was an expansive white, and the elevator took you up to tall, heavy wooden doors that opened into her staff offices. The floor is shiny and white, reflecting a purity of purpose that at this point still seems more aspirational than reality.

Aides said the Ombudsman leaves her home at 5am to beat the traffic and is behind her desk working between 6-630am. She works Saturdays, too, and expects everyone in the building to match her work ethic. 

Her office has a folding door to a little enclave she called her “workspace.” It had a long table full of voluminous case files stacked one on top of each other perpendicular to a desk that had a clear space. Next to the desk was a wheeled pushcart that took away the case files as she finished them. 

Behind the desk and to its right were towering metal shelves also full of case files stacked on top of each other. Some were standing upright, others were horizontally stacked. Sticking out from each are white sheets in the center, presumably identifying them. I looked at the cases on the long table to see small yellow post-it notes interspersed with pink ones among the pages of each file.

This is where Morales does her work. According to its own data, the Office of the Ombudsman has a workload of 11,056 cases, including 8,715 pending cases from earlier years and 2, 341 cases filed in the first half of 2015. 

Of the total number of cases, 2,940 cases or 27% have been resolved: dismissed, forwarded to the courts or given penalties.

Morales said she is hoping to hit zero backlog shortly before her term ends in 2018.

2.  Insulate from vested interests

I asked her what types of public and private pressure she gets from people with vested interests.

“No pressure on me,” she retorted. “The only pressure I have is the pressure of work.”

It seemed a glib dismissal of social and peer pressure, but perhaps this is a natural progression of her career, fulfilling the aim of the drafters of the 1987 Constitution which created the Office of the Ombudsman.

“They wanted an office that is isolated from the tentacles of power – the tentacles of politicians, the tentacles of fixers who reach out to courts, to prosecutors,” she said.

A former associate justice of the Supreme Court for nine years until she retired in 2011, Morales developed an impeccable reputation as a tough talking, no-nonsense, incorruptible magistrate. Appointed by former President Gloria Arroyo, she became the first woman to swear in a president after Benigno Aquino personally asked for her. She is the second woman to hold the post of Ombudsman.

Constitutional lawyers speak admiringly of the professionalism of Morales. A former colleague at the Supreme Court spoke about how she avoided even a hint of potential conflicts of interest, choosing instead to lead a circumspect private life.

3. Take calculated risks in standing up to power

It hasn’t been an easy time, and she’s taken great risks, focusing her attention not just on the high-profile cases against the woman who appointed her as well as other top officials, but also within her own office where deputy and assistant ombudsmen now face criminal charges for extortion.

Her first challenge was the impeachment trial of Renato Corona, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court in 2012. Using a straightforward interpretation of a little known clause in the assets statements of public officials, she was able to get evidence of large undeclared dollar accounts by going directly to AMLC, the Anti-Money Laundering Council – an interpretation challenged during the impeachment trial by Senator Miriam Santiago. 

Unperturbed and unflappable, she stood up to her former classmate, who voted to acquit Corona. 

Two years later, she suspended an Aquino favorite, Philippine National Police chief Alan Purisima along with 11 other officers, helping set the stage for the worst crisis President Aquino  faced: the Mamasapano fiasco.

In mid-2015, she took head-on a battle with Vice President Jejomar Binay, and his son, former Makati Mayor Junjun Binay, which had her defending her position in front of her former colleagues at the Supreme Court.

She would win in a few months, suspending then dismissing and perpetually disqualifying Junjun Binay from ever running for office.

To see the lines she draws between her professional and personal lives, during that time, her son died but Morales said nothing publicly. The only way the public found out was because a photo was released by Malacañang when President Aquino attended her son’s wake. On Friday, February 5, 2016, she threw out Junjun Binay’s appeal on his dismissal order and upheld criminal charges against him and his father, who has immunity until after he steps down from office. (Because he’s campaigning for president, criminal charges can’t be filed if he wins on May 9)

The Binays have been relentless in their attacks, saying the cases are politically motivated and that Morales is under “the remote control” of the Liberal Party. She shot back, “impeach me.”

“I think I have the reputation that I cannot be influenced into doing this,” she told me.  “When I accepted this post, President Aquino told me, ‘I want you to be independent.’ To his credit, the President has never – directly or indirectly – interfered or suggested how I resolve cases. We always go by the evidence.”

She looked around the room full of files again, saying the biggest pressure came from the work itself. 

4.  Be patient and take the long view

Morales was brutal in her assessment of our culture of corruption.

“I don’t know if it’s changing,” she said. “I don’t seem to see any change in the pattern of our culture because the culture is still there. Perhaps maybe 50 years from now, and we’ll all be 6 feet below the ground. Perhaps in the next generation.”

We discussed the Priority Development Assistance Fund or PDAF, systematized corruption that funnelled government funds into fake non-governmental organizations with large kickbacks for the legislators.  

The exposés in 2013 ripped open Pandora’s box, showing a decades-long practice that was quickly declared unconstitutional and resulted in cases against three incumbent senators, five former representatives, and Janet Napoles. 

“How did that go undetected as long as it did?” I asked.

“Well, officials scratch each other’s backs,” she said forcefully.  “See? Because that was already a series of acts of congressmen and senators, and it was all manipulated by a certain group. And perhaps some naive congressmen and senators were caught in the trap.  That’s why they were all victims, but they were also conspirators. I’m sure they were aware of what they were entering into.”

“But as long as it was hidden it was okay because everyone was doing it,” I said.

“Yes, yes!” she retorted. “They thought they could get away with it.”

While there have been successes, there have also been setbacks. Like the game of whack-a-mole, fighting corruption is “frustrating” – a word she used at least six times in our interview. 

“Now that PDAF is unconstitutional, can the Filipino people get the money back?” I asked.

“We are supposed to have this petition for forfeiture, but the trouble with that is with all the publicity attendant to the investigations, by the time you are allowed to file the petition for forfeiture, the coffers are empty,” Morales replied. “Billions are gone because they have been withdrawn by the respondents. So it’s frustrating.”

Even attempts to measure progress fall short. Transparency International does an annual ranking of countries based on a corruption index. From 2010 to 2014, the Philippines jumped up 49 notches, but in the just released rankings for 2015, the country dropped 10 notches.

“Some people blame us, but you see, the Office of the Ombudsman investigates and prosecutes only,” said Morales. “They should not blame me. We only present evidence. It’s the courts which determine whether or not the accused is guilty or acquitted.”

5.  Find hope in tomorrow

When I asked her to describe her lowest point, she answered quickly.

“Lowest point? When Enrile was – I have to be very frank – when Enrile was released by the Supreme Court on a ground that he didn’t even invoke” – referring to how Senator Juan Ponce Enrile was released on bail on plunder charges, a non-bailable offense. Within two weeks, the Ombudsman filed a motion for reconsideration that is still pending.

“I was frustrated,” she added. “If I recall correctly, his being ill or sick was never raised as a ground for petition for bail at the lower court.  When I say the lower court, I refer to the Sandiganbayan. It was only, I think, when he wanted to be detained at the hospital that he raised his being ill or sick to justify detention at the hospital.”

“Doesn’t it set a dangerous precedent?” I asked. “Were you surprised?” 

“I was surprised, but whether it can be presented as a dangerous precedent – I’m not going to comment on that without risk of being cited in contempt by the Supreme Court.”

“Every leader has a low moment, right?” I followed up. “How do you keep moving forward?” 

“Well, I know there is a tomorrow,” she replied. “That things could change because nothing is permanent. So that gives me the impetus to move forward – to move on.”

Culture change, shifting accepted norms and values in a meaningful way, is a person-by-person battle. 

The May 9 elections for more than 80,000 officials can either be a sprint forward or a slide downward eroding hard-won successes in the battle against corruption. 

“I just appeal to people with integrity to vote for honest people, not to sell their votes,” Morales said. “If the leaders are corrupt, what will prevent the underlings from committing corruption? But if the leader is not corrupt, the subordinate officials will have fear, or have difficulty committing corruption.”",0
129,Maria A. Ressa,"If you have the ambition to run for the highest offices in the country, you've got to let go of controlled conditions. It comes with the job.
On January 20, Rappler and its media partners DZRH-MBC, Media ng Bayan-PTV4, road-blocked up to 3 hours of airtime on nearly 200 radio and television stations across the Philippines to help give candidates for the 2016 elections a chance to present their platforms. 

After all, given the world’s challenges, we felt a need to move the public discourse away from the daily grind of controversial news clips and give the men and women running for the Philippines’ top posts a chance to face the public they want to serve.

Nearly 2,000 people filled the auditorium at De La Salle University, which had given their students the afternoon off so they could watch and participate. Before we began, I took the microphone and asked who were registered to vote, and it seemed nearly three-quarters of the audience I could see raised their hands.  

Add to this the nearly 40 viewing parties across the Philippines with AMA schools, other DLSU campuses, Lyceum – as well as the reach of Facebook and Twitter. We felt we could get a thoughtful discussion going. As the moderator, my focus was getting to the substance and highlighting some of the key issues the next leaders would have to face.

I was involved in inviting the presidential and vice-presidential candidates. While initially, all but one tandem pencil-booked the event in their calendars, I was disappointed when the weekend before, we received 3 cancellations in 3 days – the last one the night before. All but one tandem, Duterte-Cayetano, decided this was worth their time, and they postponed a crucial scheduled signing to be there. Davao Mayor Rody Duterte and his running mate, Senator Alan Cayetano, seemed thrilled to have the stage to themselves. (READ: #TheLeaderIWant trends, supporters take advantage)

Why would the other candidates give up such an opportunity?

There are at least four reasons, each of which presents both a threat and an opportunity for them in the months leading to May 9.

1.  Nothing is certain in the 2016 campaigns. 

It’s hard to be a politician hitting the campaign trail in 2016.

Old campaign rules – hitting the road, pressing the flesh, getting as many political ads as you can afford on television, harnessing a party’s political machinery to deliver votes – well, these are no longer enough.

There’s a new generation, and that’s saying a lot in a country where the median age of our 100 million people is 23 years old.

There’s an added twist.  

This generation is coming of age at a time when technology is disrupting every industry in the world, including governance and politics. 

Will these elections become our equivalent of the 2008 US elections when technology and social media catapulted a little-known senator to the presidency?

Is any candidate poised to take advantage of this technology today? 

What does this generation want? Comelec says at least 39% of the registered voters are youth, making that a coveted demographic, but they have notoriously been absent at the polls. 

When I asked the students at La Salle whether they were going to vote, we heard a resounding “yes.”  

Will that translate to action? Will they break the patterns of the past? And if they do, is that enough to overturn old power structures in our country?

So far, if we go by statistical surveys, the December surveys putting Vice President Jejomar Binay in first place reinforce the notion that the old tried-and-tested campaign methods may still be enough: press the flesh, solidify and pull together physical networks, etc.

That’s a simplistic assumption though.

Scratch deeper, and you find that context and recent events explain this – not just campaign sorties. The recovery in Binay’s ratings were also because of other factors: Grace Poe’s disqualification cases which stopped her momentum in December; Mar Roxas’ inability to sustain his momentum (even though he’s been doing the rounds like Binay); and the aftermath of Duterte’s cursing the Pope and his first real taste of how a presidential campaign is run at the national level.

Binay’s strategy of silence, which began after corruption charges caused his ratings to decline, tackles just one aspect of the campaign, but he benefitted from the cases against Poe (which other pollsters predicted). Despite that, he hasn’t fully recovered his base. 

If you go by Rappler’s informal surveys, the most engaged and active supporters in terms of evangelizing for their candidate on social media want to see Duterte for president.

2.  No room for mistakes in a tight race. 

The presidential race is too close to call. Anyone can win it, although some say this is Mar Roxas’ to lose. The vice-presidential race is as tight and perhaps even more exciting.

In races like these in the Philippines, forums and debates are difficult because one mistake can cost you the race.

Political handlers still remember the Harapan debates in 2010 which pitted the top two for vice president against each other: Senator Loren Legarda vs then survey leader Mar Roxas. Their performance ignited a storm on the then fledgling social media and effectively sidelined Legarda, who up to the debate was second to Roxas in the surveys. She was never able to recover.

That somehow helped dark horse Jejomar Binay, who had a relatively strong showing in the forum, to race up and ultimately overtake Roxas. 

Seeing how much was at risk and the immediate impact of the debate, all presidential candidates subsequently declined invitations for similar formats.

The lesson, I had hoped, was that candidates needed to hone their platforms and debate skills, but the takeaway from that for our politicians seemed to be to avoid them at all costs.

There is just too much at stake.

Until today, political campaigns try to exercise tight control over format and questions.

It’s a disservice to both the politicians, who must develop these skills, and to the public, which could be guided by a discussion on issues and see how their candidates perform under pressure. 

Real debates show us the candidate’s facts-on-file responses: unpolished and without aides and advisers. What’s the extent of their knowledge of issues and history? How do they react under pressure? What kind of values do they show? Ultimately, the crucible of a debate often shows character and shows us what kind of person we are electing into office.

3.  Is social media a plus or a minus? 

The 2013 elections for senator showed that social media could take a candidate down one or two positions in the case of now Senator Cynthia Villar, who faced a viral negative reaction on the issue of nurses.

Since 2013, Internet penetration moved from about 30% to 44% in 2015, plus smartphone penetration increased more than 200% in 2013 alone and is expected to hit 29.9% in 2016. 

There are about 42 million Filipino accounts on Facebook in 2016, and as early as 2012, SocialBakers estimated that 5 Filipinos open a Facebook account every minute. 

Given that the top demographic on social media are 18-35 years old, the exact same 39% of registered voters pinpointed by Comelec, will social media engagement translate to votes?

These elections may very well mark the tipping point for the Philippines, that so many candidates are investing in social media. Still inevitably, the easy investment is in trying to game systems – harnessing bots and other electronic tricks that could well turn the Internet into a wasteland.

So far, we haven’t seen any sophisticated systems that merge online and offline action like Barack Obama did in 2008.

Social media is a powerful tool, but it won’t mean anything if it’s not utilized in any meaningful way.

4.  Upcoming Comelec debates

Comelec is helping sponsor 3 presidential and 1 vice presidential debates, although these are largely left in the hands of the media conglomerates.

So far, it seems all candidates have said they will attend, but the risks remain.

Each step, including topics of questions and access, are being carefully negotiated. 

Having these ahead meant candidates felt they could mitigate the early risk of not attending last week’s forum.

So who won #TheLeaderIWant last week?

It wasn’t the public – people like me, hoping to see all the candidates so I could make my choice. There was a palpable thirst for real information: platforms and clear answers to questions that matter. 

During the 2 hours Duterte and Cayetano were onstage, I felt wave after wave wash through the audience as they answered questions in thoughtful ways. They had the time to convince, and they acted like a tandem.

If you have the ambition to run for the highest offices in the country, you’ve got to let go of controlled conditions. It comes with the job.

In order to win, you’ve got to show up. ",0
130,Maria A. Ressa,"The enemy isn't out there. 'I hope I will never reach the stage when I become the ogre,' says RADM Suarez.
It was a thought-provoking conversation about change in our society, an admission that our generation has largely failed, and that change would be led by this generation.

While waiting for the wedding of TV reporter Pia Gutierrez to naval officer Errol Dela Cruz on December 26, I chatted with my partner in the procession: Rear Admiral Jose Renan Suarez of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

 

He had a quiet strength that showed a passion fueling his faith in the future – necessary for his job as the head of the Naval Education and Training Command.

We spoke about a shared focus: the ongoing battle against corruption, instilling a code of ethics, providing a clear mission, and encouraging strategic thinking – for his officers and our journalists. [Disclosure: I sit on the board of the Philippine Navy.]

We discussed problems in organizational development: breaking feudal structures of management; empowering marginalized voices; creating a culture of excellence and meritocracy; encouraging entrepreneurship and accountability. 

Over the next half hour, we spoke about what drew both of us to this couple and their wedding: the idealism of youth and our hope for change in the next generation.

 

He spoke so eloquently that I asked if I could do an interview about leadership on video, and while he said yes, it’s a shadow of our conversation. With the camera on, he became stilted and retreated into “safe” language, but our conversation stayed with me for days.

We talked about the lure of power, and when I asked him how he keeps his ideals, Suarez replied, “I hope I will never reach the stage when I become the ogre.”

Then he told me a story. 

The Ogre that Never Dies

Once upon a time in a land far away, there was a village under the control of a huge and terrible ogre. Whenever he wanted to, the ogre raped, pillaged and stole whatever he wanted. 

Every year, one champion challenged him, and every year the ogre reigned supreme. The champions would just disappear. The ogre would be especially hard on the villagers after he won the annual battle. All the poor people could do was cower in fear.

Seeing the destruction, two brothers decided they would bring down the ogre once and for all. They trained long and hard.

Then the elder brother challenged the ogre. It was a long battle, but the ogre emerged victorious. That year, the ogre was especially vicious on the villagers.

The younger brother mourned the death of his brother, and vowed he would avenge his death and liberate his village.

That pushed him to train even harder because when it was his turn to fight, he wanted to be ready. The villagers saw how hard he trained, and that began to spark hope that someday, the reign of the ogre would end.

Their battle lasted for 3 days. At the end, exhausted and bleeding, he swung his axe one final time, closed his eyes, and killed the terrible ogre. 

It took him a few minutes to catch his breath. Then he looked at the body of the ogre he vanquished. 

The hair began to fall off, and to his horror, he watched the ogre’s body transform into his brother. 

He sat in shock as he saw his axe blade sticking out of his brother’s body.

He picked up the ogre’s axe, and he felt the electricity of power surge through his body. He dropped it and vowed never to pick it up again.

It turns out that the champions win every year, but the lure of power turns them into the ogre, who rapes, pillages, and steals holding the village under a vicious reign. 

The champions didn’t die. They just turned into the ogre.

There are different versions of this parable: Suarez said they were brothers; others say they were friends. Some say the winner becomes the ogre; Suarez said they had a choice. 

The lesson is the same: that the enemy isn’t out there, it’s in you, and that power is so tempting few can resist its lure – especially when you enjoy its fringe benefits.

Suarez said as he rose up the ranks, he avoided the trappings of power: for example, he drove himself to the wedding, and he doesn’t have an aide. I understood that: I live within my means; avoid borrowing against the future. That’s allowed me to quit high-paying corporate jobs, and while I make a fraction of what I used to make, my ideals are intact. 

The enemy is within. 

As we go into the 2016 elections, these are the leaders I will be voting for: the men and women who have slayed the enemy within – who are self-aware enough to draw the lines they will never cross…before the lure of power can turn them into the ogre that never dies.",0
131,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"As we wrote this piece, the election in the US was likened into a woman in travail, laboring in child birth. In a few hours, the world will know whether it’s a Donald or a Kamala. The market believes it could be problematic if the US pivots back to narrow economic nationalism which involves bringing goods and services production back to the United States, or putting up barriers to immigration. Yet, CNN’s initial exit polls indicate that only about a third of voters thought the economy is in good or excellent shape, down from about half who said the same in 2020. This is not good for Kamala. This seems to confirm Donald’s claim throughout the campaign that the Americans are not getting a fair deal. 

 

True, if the IMF’s World Economic Outlook for October 2024 is to be a lead, the projected US growth was actually revised up to 2.8 percent from July’s forecast of 2.6 percent this year. But some emerging risks could be higher. For instance, US inflation is expected to persist and keep the US Fed cautious with its easing mode. Indeed, it is about to hold its monetary policy meeting this week and the bet is on a controlled easing if not an altogether steady stance. Interest rate expectations could remain elevated and the US dollar firm. These are not actually growth-positive. 

 

Funding-wise, if the US Fed decides to be more cautious — perhaps in anticipation of the potential fallout from the election — emerging markets’ ability to borrow and service their loans in the US capital markets may be at risk. As Fitch Ratings recently reported, the Philippines is among a few sovereigns who issued foreign-currency debt in the third quarter. The country’s external debt is now at an all-time high of $130.2 billion. 

 

For emerging markets like the Philippines, monetary policy could be most appropriate, measured as necessary, but they could also be driven by geopolitical factors like the US election’s collateral impact on their trade, migration and macroeconomic policy. Beyond these, there are pressing domestic issues that could downgrade their growth prospects.

 

In this country, climate change is causing devastation to both agriculture and industry. The Department of Agriculture recently estimated that El Niño and the series of typhoons and tropical storms reduced palay supply by more than one million metric tons (MT) for the last 10 months of 2024. Historical losses averaged only 500-600,000 MT. In terms of milled rice, it means we need to import an additional 670,000 MT. If imports foul up, inflation could definitely run up and weaken personal consumption and therefore growth.

 

These weather shocks also underpin the deceleration in manufacturing activity in October. The country’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell from 53.7 to 52.9, still showing an expansion but at a slower rate. A lower reading indicates lower increase in new business orders and output. Although the highest in the ASEAN, the Philippines’ PMI reflects some slight deterioration in any of the following: new orders, output, employment, suppliers’ delivery times and stocks of purchases. 

 

The other risk is fiscal space. National government (NG) cash operations continue to bleed with a deficit reaching ₱970 billion for the first three quarters of the year which could tip at between five to six percent of GDP. With taxation relegated to the backburner, NG has ramped up public debt now at ₱15.9 trillion, about three years of the country’s annual budget. For debt servicing, NG spent ₱751 billion last year, and for the first eight months of 2024, ₱915 billion or around 15 percent of the annual budget. 

 

If the Supreme Court decides to invalidate the Department of Finance’s directive to turn over PhilHealth’s “idle, unused and excess funds” that means NG would have less ₱89.9 billion from its funding side, unless this is matched by a higher borrowing. This is hardly growth-positive. 

 

With poor allocation of the budget — pork barrel, intelligence and confidential funds, and weak monitoring of flood control projects, and all that — we doubt whether the basic issues of human capital development and infrastructure could be given sufficient support.

 

Human capital is developed when we spend enough for education and health, and when we spend more for innovation through higher levels of research and development. Our own National Innovation Council, in charge of formulating the development of the National Innovation Agenda and Strategy Document or NIASD, is just beginning. The secretariat housed in NEDA has little institutional character and funding. No government can overemphasize enough the enormous value added of education, training, skills set, innovation and digital transformation in elevating and maintaining both the growth momentum and the quality of growth. 

 

Infrastructure, on the other hand, as represented by the government’s 13 flagship projects aimed at establishing physical connectivity, water resources, digital connectivity and health, has barely taken off the ground. As of March 2024, only two have been completed. The government should assure the civil society of the higher likelihood of the other 11 being completed this year even as the August 2024 infrastructure spending actually declined by 11 percent.  To be sure, good and quality infrastructure increases the sustainability of growth. Whatever shortfall in domestic investment can be very well complemented by foreign investment which would not need additional incentive to come and invest in the Philippines. With good infra backbone and people, we have what it takes to host successful business ventures. 

 

Already, some observers of the Philippine growth story have begun to forecast lower growth for the country. For instance, the Fund at the conclusion of the 2024 Article IV consultation announced forecast below-target growth rates of 5.8 percent and 6.1 percent for 2024 and 2025, respectively, on account of the expected slowdown in major economies and potential increases in commodity prices. The Fund, however, places some confidence that if properly harnessed, the country’s abundant natural resources, untapped blue economy and its demographic advantage could by all means secure for the Philippines a more vigorous, more resilient economy.

 

Moody’s Analytics broadly shares this view in its assessment of the growth prospect for the third quarter of 5.7 percent. It is not too sanguine about the impact of the BSP’s rate cuts because of the lag time, while exports may “lose some shine” due to soft external demand and slowdown in world tourist arrivals. 

 

While the issue between Donald and Kamala could be existential for some countries, our hands are quite full with household problems and challenges. Good governance could not be more pressing than now",0
132,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"We have been participating almost every year in the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Asian Regional Forum on Investment Management of Foreign Exchange Reserves, before and after my retirement from central banking in 2019. While there was some lull during the pandemic in 2020, which actually provided ADB with a new angle. In our spirited one-on-one session in Sapporo, Japan last September, the Bank’s Deputy Treasurer Sukhumarn Phanachet asked about the important lessons of the health crisis for central banking. 

There were many for emerging markets, but for us, the key lesson is the need for monetary authorities to ensure that non-monetary measures were also deployed in the relentless fight against inflation. Rapid price movement was not a problem per se during the pandemic and the year after. Inflation in the Philippines averaged only 2.4 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, both within target. We are all familiar with the story, why — the Philippine economy was literally locked down. Any imbalance in supply and demand was suppressed by restricted business activities. 

But the next two years were nightmares for both the central bank and the government. 

Both headline and core inflation rates reached their peaks, breaching the two to four percent official inflation target, indicating that both supply and demand factors could not have been busier at work. Unfortunately, while the BSP managed domestic demand by appropriate monetary tightening, there was some difficult challenges on the supply side. 

The unprecedented monetary and fiscal support during the pandemic did not elicit appropriate response from the severely constrained business activities. Firms were not fast enough to increase their output and meet higher domestic demand. Add to this mismatch is the supply disruptions in rice, onion, garlic, meat, fruits, and vegetables.

In all the press statements and forward guidance issued by the BSP in the last two years, the need for more strategic supply-side initiatives had been consistently hammered. Of course, like the US Federal Reserve at some point before that, the BSP was less careful in looking through the supply side. For that matter, many central bankers had thought those significant price movements of rice, oil and other basic commodities were transitory. Many of them held that monetary policy could just observe and sit out their ultimate return to more normal levels. 

We are wiser now, knowing they never reverted soon enough, and as a result, monetary tightening was deployed quite late in the day. The market had begun to factor in these persistent price increases in their view. Inflation expectations were de-anchored and inflation even got more entrenched.

In the Philippines, therefore, it was correct for the BSP to have sustained contractionary monetary policy until they were convinced of the more definite decline in headline and core inflation rates. With the emergence of new risks to inflation and the peso, we share the BSP position to avoid a more substantial easing. They can afford to be more patient in monetary unwinding because the economy has remained resilient. 

This narrative is no different from what happened and what is happening in the global economy today. 

As highlighted during last week’s Annual IMF-World Bank Meetings by the presentation of the October 2024 World Economic Outlook “the decline in inflation without a global recession is a major achievement.” True, the surge of inflation after the pandemic and the subsequent decline in inflation recently demonstrated what the Fund described as a unique combination of serious supply disruptions, strong domestic demand and geopolitical crisis courtesy of the war in Ukraine and lately what started in the Gaza strip.

The importance of supply dynamics in the fight against inflation was captured by the Fund’s research showing “an upward shift and a steepening of the relationship between activity and inflation, the Philips curve.” It was the tight monetary policy and labor market stabilization that bought time for those supply logistics to ease. Monetary policy kept inflation expectations hinged which, in turn, helped keep wages broadly aligned. In other economies, though, wage adjustments were actually overdue and the surge in inflation simply made it exigent. 

Is the worst over for the global economy?

If the Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva’s take during the press conference of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) last Oct. 25 is to be the defining view, there is now a good balance between confidence and caution. We can be confident that the global economy is more resilient than we first thought and that price movements are essentially stabilizing. Public policies tamed inflation without significant disruption to economic growth. But we have to keep our guard up. Caution is imperative because even if inflation is trending down, price levels remain very elevated. More people are getting poorer. The prospect for low growth and high debt exists especially in emerging and developing countries. Trade and finance fragmentation complicates growth as it is driven by wars, security concerns and competitiveness.

Against these new challenges, the Fund expects some policy gears to refocus. Central banks need to continue remaining attentive, always looking for evidence, to guide them towards an even conduct of monetary policy, that which is neither too late nor too early. We should add that correct judgment is also critical on the amount of the adjustment. Otherwise, it could affect disinflation or growth, or worse, both, even if perfectly timed. Communication is key to keeping inflation expectations well anchored. 

On the fiscal side, fiscal consolidation should be pursued at all costs. The problem is that with the extraordinary accommodation of the pandemic, fiscal buffers have thinned out. Since taxation is not necessarily the preferred route of many governments, many economies seem to be borrowing their way to economic growth. What is worse is that, and we hope this is not the emerging option for the Philippines, some governments are borrowing their way out of debt!

Obviously, there is no substitute to abandoning business as usual. That will never bring us the spectacular quality growth that we badly need. Large infrastructure deficit, poverty, and income inequality in the Philippines require substantial and quality economic growth. We cannot always rely on more and more capital and labor, and so we should aim for greater productivity and economic efficiency mainly through technological innovation. Most important, good growth is impossible if our political leadership cannot even solve the issues of corruption, and yes, floods!",0
133,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"When the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winners of the Nobel Prize for Economics in Stockholm last Oct. 14, the role of political institutions in economic development and long-term prosperity received some kind of a revival. It’s been 12 years since the initial release of the pioneering “Why Nations Fail.”

What is interesting here is that the three Nobel Laureates were careful not to be caught in institutional determinism. While acknowledging some limitation of their approach, one can get the impression that any subtle historical interplay between geography, culture and institutions, whether extractive or inclusive, may not be completely recognized. There is some scope for clarifying what time periods in economic history of nations are critical when building appropriate institutions. 

Which brings us to King’s College London and Oxford University’s Daniel Susskind’s new book “Growth: A Reckoning,”  which was released only this year. In five parts with a total of 11 chapters, the book in chapter 4 quoted Germany’s Angela Merkel who, in 2010, said, “We need three things above all. First: growth. Second: growth. And third: growth. Growth isn’t everything, that’s true. But without growth everything is nothing.”

If the Nobel Laureates stressed on the need for good institutions to generate prosperity, one that is sustainable, Susskind is quite sanguine about the role of new ideas in driving technological progress and economic growth even as innovation thrives only when inclusive institutions are in place.

Attaining economic growth is without question an existential issue at all times. Lack of growth breeds mass unemployment, poverty, hunger, and crime. Poverty and hunger foment mass discontent and ultimately, revolution. Susskind brought to mind the front page of The New York Times on V-J Day that says it all: “Five Million Expected to Lose Arms Job.” There was fear that after the war, millions of discharged soldiers would flood the United States from the front lines to look for civilian jobs. Without growth that was produced by World War II, unemployment was inevitable. The memory of the Great Depression was just too fresh. Full employment has become a universal priority. History shows that most of the civilized world succeeded in attaining economic growth even through two world wars.

And the list of growth benefits is almost endless. Extreme poverty dropped from eight out of 10 in 1820 to one in 10 today. Susskind even commented that growth “turned obesity, rather than famine, into the rich world’s main problem.” 

“Growth: A Reckoning” observes that growth could pose a dilemma. While it’s associated with many of the world’s successes, growth is also linked with many of its failures. In his article in the IMF’s “Finance and Development” of September 2024, Susskind argued: “The promise of growth pulls us toward pursuing ever more of it, but its price pushes us powerfully away from that chase. It’s as if we cannot go on — and yet we must.”

In the Philippines, while we succeeded in attaining robust economic growth in the last 25 years, we also experienced inequality-creating type of economic growth. Some have become inordinately prosperous, but a greater many have sunk into abject poverty. Growth has also caused environmental degradation. The need for more growth in the Philippines is quite obvious because of the economic scarring of the pandemic and the continuing deficit in infrastructure and social services. A growth of six to seven percent is hardly enough when viewed against these challenges.

But Susskind takes exception of the “degrowthers” who propose that if growth abets so much social cost, then less growth could be desirable. He believes that “growth does not come from using more and more finite resources” but from “discovering more and more productive ways of using those resources.” The planet is not the limit of growth, but it is the ability to generate new ideas that would lead to technological progress, innovation, and multiple productivity. 

As we wrote in a previous column in another broadsheet, we don’t have enough labor and capital at every instance to sustain economic growth, but higher productivity can ensure sustainability and with correct public policy, inclusivity. That should help transform the Philippine economy. If we wish to reduce poverty and mitigate income inequality, we need more quality growth. 

More specifically, Susskind proposes a few steps to generate new ideas:

First, the intellectual property regime must be reformed. To him, the current regime protects the status quo, preserves the monopoly and influence of past ideas to the present, all at the cost of those who wish to use and re-use them in the future for public goods. The current copyright law across the world has not been reformed for the last 50 years.

Second, more attention and funding should be committed to research and development (R&D). In other countries, the British economist lamented the sharp   decline in R&D in France, the Netherlands, and the UK since mid-20th century. US and Israel also showed some weakening in R&D but there has been a significant increase in private companies including Alphabet, Huawei and Meta which spend 15 percent of their revenues. With very little R&D activities, it is difficult to expect new ideas to be forthcoming.

Third, inequality should be reduced and people should be supported in their entry into idea-generating economic sectors. If racial minorities, women and children from low-income families are free and helped to invent new ideas at the same rate as their white counterparts, Susskind estimated that innovations could be quadrupled. Moral arguments have been posed but economics-wise, a society where a great portion do not do research and generate game-changing ideas is just inefficient.

And finally, technology should be used to discover new ideas. Susskind cited the case of DeepMind’s AlphaFold, which solved the “protein folding” problem in 2020. It can calculate the 3D shape of millions of proteins in minutes. With this capability, human understanding of various diseases and their corresponding treatment is now higher many times over. 

With technological innovations, we could grow more and growth could be greener and less costly. Growing the economy this way would definitely make the world “fairer, greener, and less dependent on disruptive technologies, and more respectful of place.”

It’s time to be kind to ourselves.",0
134,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"It was the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences that announced the winners of the Nobel Prize for Economics at a press conference in Stockholm last week. They were Daron Acemoglu of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Simon Johnson also of MIT, and James Robinson of the University of Chicago. They collaborated in working on the linkage between political institutions, economic development, and long-term prosperity. We have been citing their work in many previous economic briefings on the Philippines’ failure to translate its decent economic growth since 1999 until the 2020 pandemic into real progress and catch up with its ASEAN neighbors. 

In particular, Acemoglu and Robinson co-authored the book “Why Nations Fail.” In addition, they produced an earlier book, “Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy,” and later, “The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, and the Fate of Liberty” (2019). Acemoglu also co-authored with Johnson “Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle over TechnoIogy and Prosperity” (2023). It is difficult to dismiss such Colossal research work. “Why Nations Fail” was anchored on 15 years of research. But the actual research collaboration among the three Nobel laureate spanned over two decades. This is definitely not a piece of cake. 

RAND Corporation’s Warren Bas in “Washington Post” of April 20, 2012, about a month after the book’s publication, described it as an engaging, in fact very absorbing, endeavor to explain the persistence of poverty among 1.29 billion people in the developing world who struggled to survive on less than $1.25 a day. At the time, the average American was seven times richer than an average Mexican, 10 times than the average Peruvian, 20 times than the average inhabitant of sub-Saharan Africa, and about 40 times than the average citizen of such poor economies as Mali, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone. 

It's not about geography or culture. It’s all about key shifts in economic and political institutions that can either be inclusive such as power-sharing, productivity, education, health, technological advances and digital transformation; or extractive which include grabbing wealth and resources away from one part in favor of a few. Inclusive institutions allow the citizenry to participate in economic activities. It is one where people’s talents and skills are best harnessed by society. 

Think of Congo’s Mobutu Sese Seko who dominated the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1965 to 1997. He made airstrips of such an impoverished economy wide enough to accommodate the giant Concordes he rented from Air France. He exploited Congo’s natural resources, sucked them dry. His country’s economic and political institutions were too weak to deliver basic services to the people but just strong enough to secure Mobutu and his cronies.

Think of Philippine politicians who had exclusive access to the nation’s forests and mining rights, even black sands, who opposed deregulating the economy and liberalizing it to make markets more contestable to business people including foreign investors. All these years, even elections have fallen to the extractive control of politicians and the ruling elite fighting over whatever is left to fight over. 

Acemoglu and Robinson would contend that a combination of corrupt regimes, exploitative elites and selfish institutions, as well as weak state apparatus could only produce poverty and backwardness, economic lethargy, intramurals among the ruling elites. This is one sure recipe for failure. 

“Why Nations Fail” is indeed “bracing, garrulous, wildly ambitious and ultimately hopeful. It may, in fact, be a masterpiece.”

Bass was correct because after 12 years, “Why Nations Fail” is one of the major reasons for the award of the Nobel Prize. 

Whether we like it or not, the Philippines should have learned from their works. One reason: it was first published on March 20, 2012, more than 12 years or two presidents ago. Second reason: the lesson can be summarized in one sentence with two words “Institutions matter.” A corollary statement may also be appropriate, and that is the importance of property rights and the rule of law. And finally, the World Bank flew Robinson, one of the book’s two authors, to Manila to explain to the country’s economic managers, academics, and business leaders why some nations are wealthy, while the rest are dirt poor. That was 12 years ago.

We could have learned that if we maintain poor rule of law and institutions that exploit, rather than uplift, the population, we would not generate enough growth to address poverty and income inequality. Democracies, on the other hand, that adhere to the rule of law and protect individual human rights are the ones that could generate growth.

We could have learned that a reversal of fortune could happen to colonized states like those in South and Central America. These countries ended up poorer after colonization. Many of us in Southeast Asia are former colonies of both European and North American colonial masters. But it looks like in the Philippines, among the ASEAN 5, time stood still. Our colonizers established mostly extractive, rather than inclusive institutions that protected property rights, enforced the rule of law, educated their population, and encouraged innovation and entrepreneurialism.

We could have learned that despite its spectacular growth as a new model of authoritarian growth, China’s model did not impress the two economists. Calling China’s institutions as extractive, Acemoglu and Robinson argued that such regimes can, and did, produce temporary economic growth but only as long as these remain politically centralized. For them, notwithstanding China’s transition from essentially extractive to more inclusive institutions, it is “still saddled with an extractive regime.” It still plays a game of catch up.  Whether it will succeed or not will be seen in the next few decades.

When nations fail, and their political system guarantees that the elites remain in the driver’s seat, this year’s Nobel laureates proposed that no one will trust the political leadership’s promises of future economic reforms. That is why, no improvement, no progress is made.

When nations fail, and the threat of a revolution becomes more imminent even if peaceful like what the Philippines mounted in EDSA in 1986, those in power and authority would face a dilemma. To keep power, they would try and placate the electorate by promising future reforms, something that disappear when the threat vanishes in thin air. But in the future, the population would grow skeptical about those promises, and there would be no ownership of public policy. By that time, the only option available is to transfer power and revive democracy.",0
135,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"The photos of those who trooped to the Manila Hotel and other Comelec offices to file their certificates of candidacy (COCs) gave us the impression that they have all figured out what they seriously intend to do in the next few years once they get elected. 

We wish them the best of luck knowing that the current state of affairs in the Philippines is more than challenging. It is daunting.

For those running for national posts, they have to deliver about 10 percent economic growth for the next few years in order to reverse the deep 9.5 percent contraction in GDP during the pandemic. It is not enough to muddle through the next few years with the Philippine government’s maximum target of eight percent.

We need to grow more than our past because, among other serious problems, learning poverty rate in the Philippines is 91 percent! This means that nine out of 10 Filipino children cannot read and understand a simple reading material by the age of 10. This is a huge handicap because good reading proficiency is the student’s key access and foundation to learning in other areas like mathematics and science. Without reading skills, one of the SDG goals, ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all, will remain as mere aspiration for years to come.

As the World Bank reported last year, this learning deficit is due to our teachers’ lack of mastery of their subject matter and absenteeism. In its report “Fixing the Foundation: Teachers and Basic Education in East Asia and Pacific,” the Philippines’ teaching method was considered one of the most ineffective in Southeast Asia. Our classroom culture is far from conducive to learning. Our students are not challenged enough, they are not engaged enough. As a result, they learn very little and their socio-emotional skills as successful learners would remain undeveloped. 

Teacher training did not fare as well; they have failed to improve our teachers’ grasp of course content. In the same World Bank report, two-thirds of Filipino teachers had “medium-low” use of effective teaching practices, some 19 percent had “low” use and only 15 percent had “medium-high” use of effective teaching practices. No one was observed having a “high” use of effective pedagogy. 

If incompetent teachers impart knowledge incompetently, this would “translate into poorer learning outcomes.” It should be no surprise that indeed in the last Program for International Student Assessment (Pisa) testing in 2022, the Philippines out of 81 countries ranked sixth from the last in mathematics with an average score of 355. In science, it ranked third from last with an average score of 356 and sixth from last in reading with an average score of 347.

With severe setback during the pandemic, student learning was also held back by low teachers’ salaries, poor working conditions and weak career progression. These issues could explain another challenge, and this is the high absenteeism of around 40 percent among teachers not only in the Philippines but also in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam.

The World Bank’s recommendation on fostering systemic improvements and supporting all teachers is most appropriate but this will require money from the Treasury. Unless this fundamental problem of human capital is arrested promptly, we should be bothered by the quality of our political leaders at all levels and those who would be joining the workforce as lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers, and yes, voters in the next 10 to 20 years. 

Of course, we are only talking here about what teachers are expected to impart to their students in terms of information and a set of predetermined skills sets in mathematics, literature, science and even programming and languages. What is implicit in this exercise is that the body of knowledge to be dispensed is what the students would need in 10-20 years. 

But as Yuval Noah Harari in his 21 Lessons for the 21st Century argued, we need more than what he called production-line theory of education involving a school, with classrooms of cohorts, and teachers paid by the government or their private employer to teach. “One of them tells you about the shape of the earth, another tells you about the human past, and a third tells you about the human body.”

Since nobody for sure knows what the next 10 or 20 years will bring, change and discontinuity will indeed be the salient feature of modern life. And transitions almost always cause stress. Thus, as Harari quoted, some experts would rather suggest that we teach beyond the 3 Rs (reading, wRiting and aRithmetic), the 4Cs: critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity. These courses could provide our young students with life skills to deal with “change, learn new things, and preserve … mental balance in unfamiliar situations.”

By 2050, the world could be so different from where we stand today. The need to adapt is essential, and we need definitely to invent new ideas and products, we need to reinvent ourselves constantly. Harari could not be closer to the truth when he wrote that “as the pace of change increases, not just the economy but the very meaning of ‘being human’ is likely to mutate.”

It must therefore be clear to those who filed their COCs for the May 2025 elections that one major constraint to a more transformative growth of the Philippine economy is therefore human capital. Our educational system is a big failure and we need more than money to turn it around. We need thinking heads. The odds are just too great because beyond education, our health system is weak, just weak. We only have a ratio of 99 hospital beds for every 100,000 of our population, something that is a just a third of what they have in other developing countries. Out of over 42,000 barangays, 44 percent do not have health stations. 

These and more legacy problems of the last 70 years await the legion who committed to render public service together with their families and associates. It’s up to us voters to disprove what John Maynard Keynes once quipped: “Before the 18th century, mankind entertained no false hopes.”",0
136,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Two days ago, Oct. 1, poll aspirants started to flock to various filing centers of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to file their certificates of candidacy (COC) for 18,280 elective positions for the May 2025 national and local elections. Filipinos will be choosing 12 senators, 254 members of the House of Representatives, 63 party-list representatives, 82 governors, 149 city mayors and 1,493 municipal mayors, among others.

Public money from taxes and other forms of revenues will pay their salaries and allowances as well as those of their assistants and staff. Our people are therefore entitled to dream that these elected officials would use their mind to bring about new ways of governance, and they are legions in the annals of public management and political science. 

Will we ever see elections like what we do every three years adhere to democracy and better choices?

Our poll aspirants promise positive change with the moons and the stars, complete with catchy slogans and jingles. But alas, after three years for most, and six years for senators, they would prove that they are no different, they are the same old bananas! Rehashed, recycled, rebranded.

For the normal pathway to electoral victory is popularity. One wins because his name rings a bell, thanks to showbiz of entertainment and comedy. But political governance is beyond cracking green jokes and mastering street fights. And no, voters scarcely distinguish between real world challenges and staged heroism. They trust false news and cold cash on E day can certainly make up for the difference. 

Once elected, our filmdom legend could not even speak, or sponsor a bill on the legislative floor, or formulate coherent positions on key issues of the day. It is asking for a miracle if their kind could figure out how the hearings on Alice Guo and POGO operations could aid legislation, or the revelation on the role of PNP in extrajudicial killings could lead to urgent cleansing of the police rank. If true, it is mind-boggling how heads of public agencies could be eliminated like premeditating rat extermination.

Comelec’s posters claim that the May 2025 elections represent “makabagong halalan.” BAGO stands for better, automation, governance and opportunities.

Will this be any different from elections past?

It is interesting that mature democracies like Switzerland could still convene a conference to reinvent democratic elections. The Bern Conference was organized May 9-10 last year through the Parliamentary Assembly and the Swiss Government in celebration of the Swiss accession to the Council of Europe in order to “ensure democratic elections even in difficult times caused by multiple crises.” In attendance were over 130 politicians from Europe and representatives of Europe’s institutional partners and electoral management bodies, international organizations, academia and civil society. 

The President of the Swiss National Council, Mr. Martin Candinas, could not have said it any clearer when he declared that “No election alone is a guarantee for a functioning democracy. But a democracy has no legitimacy without elections. Free and fair elections are indispensable means for citizens to express their opinion and to be able to make decisions.” 

Very true for the Philippines.

While innovations, especially technological in the way Comelec commits that the May 2025 elections would be better and automated, promise new and more representative form of voting, the question raised in Switzerland is whether such promises could be delivered in the long run. The recent May 2022 automated election, the result of which is being challenged in the Supreme Court due to election anomaly, did not seem to deliver new and innovative political leadership in various levels of governance. The Filipino electorate, enlightened or not, would have the opportunity to change government composition partly only in 2025, and partly only in 2028. 

No different from the cheap gimmicks of the incumbents here, the Bern Conference also highlighted the temptation for the executive powers to “misuse the state of emergency for political gains as well as the important role of media which needs to remain balanced even in such situations, where incumbents are naturally getting more coverage.”

We are quite skeptical about this statement from the Bern Conference that indeed elections conducted in a true spirit of democracy could deflect tension, sort out conflicts and invest governments with legitimacy to govern. We need to define what the true spirit of democracy is in the context of Philippine reality. Instead of deflecting tension, Philippine elections have become famous for producing tension and even open confrontation. Instead of sorting out conflicts, Philippine elections actually complicate conflicts and increase their likelihood of happening. Instead of investing the government with legitimacy, thanks to electoral fraud and cheating, Philippine elections undermine winning candidates’ claim to victory and the right to lead. 

The Bern Conference also observed the increased use and dependence on ICTs, technology if we will, and the risks of manipulation of election results. AI and cyber technology are neutral; they can be used either to protect the integrity of the election or to thwart public will. 

Based on this, the Conference stressed the need to find new ways to establish transparency of data sources and algorithms; help people recognize when they are exposed to AI-generated content; preserve ultimate human control in essential decision making; and ensure compliance of AI-driven systems with best practices in electoral norms. We are not surprised that the Conference recommended that governments intensify the fights against disinformation and propaganda, strengthen cybersecurity and protection of critical electoral infrastructure. Disinformation and propaganda are the enemies of democracy.

Finally, the Conference raised the issue of public-private partnership in service provision. Private sector participants should be held accountable for upholding security standards, that their source codes should be secured and always available for public scrutiny and auditing. It doesn’t have to require, as in the Philippines, Supreme Court ruling to release simple transmission logs during the automated May 2022 presidential elections.

To further lock in the integrity of future elections in the Philippines, we may also wish to consider the recommendation to undertake comprehensive risk assessment to ensure our processes are sufficiently robust while guaranteeing adherence to principles of democratic elections. The Philippine Government can invite international organizations with formal observation mandate to help implement electoral standards and protect the integrity of future elections. 

Why, that could help prevent those same old bananas from wreaking havoc to our politics and the economy.",0
137,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Disrespecting the law is no less than an act of insolence, and in the “Law Insider” formulation, that is arrogant, presumptuous, impudent, or in fact even insulting. It could even be at once rude because it is no less than the Philippine law that is being crushed. 

What Alice Guo did was a shameless disregard of the law, call it contempt of the law. If true, being non-Filipino made it worse, many times over. Of course, no less disrespectful of the law is how Apollo Quiboloy broke it by refusing to surrender to the authorities, until recently, despite the arrest warrant served to him in his own kingdom. 

Unfortunately, disrespect of the law, rather than the rule of law, has a long history in the Philippines.

The American expatriate businessman Harry Stonehill broke the law when he bribed high-level government officials in the early 1960s. His case also dragged at least three former presidents in order to protect his $50 million business in tobacco and various commercial crops, among others. Then Justice Secretary Jose W. Diokno caused the raid of the offices of 42 of Stonehill’s business establishments in 1962 and the arrest of Stonehill and some of his associates. 

Based on what was described as six army trucks worth of incriminating evidence, Stonehill was accused of tax evasion, economic sabotage, and various other charges that could have been established by his Blue Book which mysteriously went missing. It contained the names of Filipino politicians and government officials who were alleged to have received bribe money from the American businessman. Before the case could be tried in court, Stonehill was subsequently deported by Malacañang.

Alice Guo treated Philippine law like rag when all evidence points to her faking her birth circumstances to gain entry into the Philippines and become a Filipino citizen. If she is indeed non-Filipino and therefore disqualified, she violated our electoral law when she ran and took her oath of office as mayor of Bamban, Tarlac. This gains credence in the face of Guo’s fingerprints being a perfect match with a Chinese national, Guo Hua Ping. Guo could not explain how she was able to construct the multibillion building complex of POGO business in Tarlac. It was impossible because her tax returns and SALN could only support a modest lifestyle.

As Reuters reported, even as Philippine authorities had filed several counts of money laundering, Guo continues to insist “she is natural-born Philippine citizen facing ‘malicious accusations,’ and had no knowledge of criminality.” This is strange because she could not even remember her roots, even her playmates while growing up.

For weeks before she escaped from the Philippines to Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, our elected senators could not get through her. It was a blank wall for them when Guo would always retort that she grew up in a farm, her only close friends were the farmhands in their piggery, or when confronted by documentary evidence of her true nationality, that she could not remember anymore. 

The bigger picture is the undeniable involvement of those in authority. 

She could not have entered the Philippines without the complicity of our immigration authorities. She could not have produced her Filipino birth certificate without the knowledge of the civil registrar and the statistics authorities. She could not have run for public office if our election authorities conducted a simple due diligence. She could not have sustained her POGO and alleged illegal activities if law enforcers did not turn a blind eye. She could not have escaped from the Philippines in July without official intervention. 

It's a sad commentary that even notarization of public documents could be dragged into this scandal. As Rappler reported, a lawyer “committed lapses when he notarized the counter-affidavit of suspended Bamban Mayor Alice Guo in relation to a DOJ human trafficking complaint on Aug. 14.” By that time, Guo was already out of the country. 

When she was finally arrested by Indonesian Interpol in Tangerang, it was disclosed that a Singaporean national helped Guo book four hotel rooms in Batam island. And to the surprise of many, no less than Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos and PNP Chief PGen. Rommel Marbil who served the Senate arrest warrant to Guo. She was brought back to Manila in yes, a private plane. 

There was little progress during the Senate hearing, notwithstanding the competent leadership of Senator Risa Hontiveros. All that Guo had to do to frustrate the senators’ spirited questioning was to claim innocence, short memory or the risk of incriminating herself. 

If at all, Guo even taught the Senate what to do and this was to convert the public hearing into an executive session. Only then could she disclose to the Senate who engineered her escape. When the Senate refused, Guo was persuaded to write on a piece of paper the name of the person who helped her escape. By the disclosure of two senators, another non-Filipino disregarded the Senate arrest warrant by helping Guo and her siblings and associates avoid arrest through the southern backdoor. 

Nothing should surprise us anymore when non-Filipinos have the gall to disrespect our legal and justice system. We ourselves have nurtured such a habit of setting aside the law and just treating it as an elephant in the room, and in many cases, too, as a doormat.

This is in contrast to what the Philippines aspired for a “people-centered, clean and efficient governance” in the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022. In Chapter 5, we as a people, expressed our adherence to a high-trust society where “citizens obey the law, they willingly pay the correct taxes trusting that government will prudently manage the fiscal resources.” 

Indeed, the cornerstone of a high-trust society is the trust in government. 

But we have doubt whether the plan to “enhance the social fabric by making government worthy of people’s trust” actually bore fruit given Alice’s tale in POGO land.",0
138,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"While we were rocked by the news of alleged irregularities in the use of confidential funds in one government office, it was as shocking to know of another irregularity in the procurement of laptops in the Department of Education, of all departments. As if these were not enough, the Commission on Audit flagged the same department over its feeding program. Audit teams found “there were either unsanitary packing, questionable expiry dates, or pests and molds on the bread meant for students.” The program was funded up to ₱5.69 billion.

In the last two weeks, the Filipino people also learned that evading jail term and getting away with it, at least until yesterday, is not only for the movies. The suspended Mayor of Bamban, Tarlac Alice Guo succeeded in leaving the Philippines presumably through the southern back door without any trace of departure from the country. Her lawyers and notary public continued to maintain “she is still very much around.” Her arrest yesterday by Indonesian authorities proves they were not exactly truthful.

Again, our law enforcement authorities have more homework to do when fugitive televangelist Apollo Quiboloy and his five co-accused in a human trafficking case remain at large for months after a Pasig regional trial court (RTC) issued the arrest warrant. The authorities also failed to serve another arrest warrant against Quiboloy subsequently issued by a Davao RTC over a sexual abuse case.

And yes, while the directive to sweep all “sleeping” funds of government owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) has been justified as prudent, one that minimizes the need for higher taxes or more borrowings, this broadsheet reported last Friday the successful launch of public offshore commercial borrowing of $2.5 billion, or at ₱57 to a dollar, more than ₱142 billion. For the first half of 2024 alone, it was also reported that the country’s foreign borrowings already aggregated ₱267.4 billion.

Which brings us to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) from where another $500 million is expected, or around ₱28.5 billion. This loan is dedicated to climate finance and is part of the $10 billion commitment announced by ADB in Dubai last year. That’s ₱570 billion aimed at improving the climate resilience of local communities in the Philippines. Investments are expected to go to public transport, clean energy, disaster risk management and social protection.

With dwindling fiscal space, we have no option but to pin tremendous hope on this program loan. So far this year, we have received two deafening wake-up calls from the country’s third tropical cyclone this year, typhoon Carina which literally punished us last July 24, and tropical storm Enteng that caused no small amounts of floods and landslides in Luzon this week. 

Contrary to the allegations of some, the problem in disaster management is not the number of appropriate weather advisories issued by, in the case of the Philippines, PAGASA. PAGASA continues to monitor these types of weather developments 24 hours a day. Execution of PAR plus five remains, meaning, the advisory covers the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) but expanded by five degrees in case a tropical cyclone develops beyond PAR. 

As a global community, it is our lack of sensitivity and response to the impacts of climate change including what the ADB and the United Nations in their recent report called “slow and sudden onset of weather events” that are compromising our ability, and those of other countries, in meeting the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While some steady progress has been made in enhancing food security, mitigating malnutrition and improving public health, more progress is absolutely required. The challenges of climate change, health crisis and the scourge of inflation are wreaking havoc on agricultural and labor productivity, loss of jobs and displacement of people. As a result, our progress in promoting food security, and reducing poverty is severely hampered.

We need to do more. We need to expedite the disposition of cases involving POGO champions and their escapades, or the unmitigated incompetence or lack of accountability of some in authority. We should avoid dissipating scarce public resources in favor of non-essential but favored public projects.

Thus, the report of the ADB and the United Nations’ Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations Development Programme, “People and Planet: Addressing the Interlinked Challenges of Climate Change, Poverty and Hunger in Asia and the Pacific,” released last February 2024 could not have stressed that message enough. Incremental progress, that which we are only capable of, is considered many times inadequate in achieving the SDGs of 2015 — zero poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, among others.

The problem in many countries, if not all of them, is that “global and regional policies do not adequately support the integration of climate priorities with efforts to address poverty and hunger.” We put a wedge between economic development and health, for instance, or disaster risk reduction and poverty and income inequality, for that matter. Some governments are willing to forego strong promotion of public health or quality education in favor of petty local infrastructure projects or expansion of government plantilla positions even as digital solutions are readily available.

Before it is too late, we need to put in our spirit that weather shocks continue to be more severe over the years, that their burdens are unevenly distributed to the disadvantage of the impoverished nations and peoples. No less than UN Resident Representative Gustavo Gonzalez who declared that the Asia-Pacific region, the Philippines included, “is not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.” If this statement from the United Nations two years ago is to be believed, SDGs would only be achieved in 2065 or 40 years from today.

In fact, the Philippine Statistics Authority earlier this year reported that for us, less than 20 percent of SDG indicators were on track, with nearly 30 percent regressing. With our poor capacity to roll with the weather punches, we cannot say more than that for our efforts to reduce poverty and hunger, as well as achieve quality public health and education.

While we spend time on other things…",0
139,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Last week, we concluded our piece with the quote from Finance Secretary Ralph Recto that the full remittance and appropriate use of PhilHealth’s ₱89.9 billion could boost GDP by 0.88 ppts and employment by 600,000. It is not as simple as deciding whether there are excess funds idling in PhilHealth treasury and all that is needed to do is to direct its remittance to the Bureau of the Treasury. From there, the National Government can earmark the freed funds to finance infrastructure and other social services. In the process, to the extent that government finance leads to higher spending on capital goods and hiring people, national output and jobs creation are likely to expand.

The fundamental issue is whether the ₱89.9 billion funds are indeed excess funds. Some quarters might wish to play technical about it but when decent healthcare in the Philippines remains out of reach for many Filipinos, the so-called ₱500 billion in PhilHealth’s reserve funds are barely enough. It is unconscionable for PhilHealth leadership, then and now, to even talk about profitable operation and reserve funds. Reserve funds are supposed to be used to increase the benefits or to reduce member contributions pursuant to the law. 

Higher benefits in recent period are an empty boast when some 44 percent of health care spending consists of out-of-pocket payments. While PhilHealth’s benefits have been recently increased to 30 percent, health care industry representatives claim that such an increase came only after 10 years. PhilHealth’s actuarial responsibilities and payables remain large. How can anyone argue that the use of PhilHealth funds for the government’s priority programs “will not affect PhilHealth’s daily operations” when the law is clear that such reserve funds, or any income of PhilHealth, cannot accrue to the National Government?

True, such a diversion of funds “will not reduce even a single centavo from the benefits that members will receive.” But PhilHealth can be compelled to increase the benefits of members. It is pointless to argue that by the end of 2024, PhilHealth stands to earn about ₱61.18 billion because the public health deficit is just too wide. Another ₱70 billion in government subsidies next year should be welcome.

It is therefore to the discredit of PhilHealth that the reserve funds accumulated to staggering amount, thanks to their treasury operations, instead of being used to mitigate the health conditions of Filipinos. Health care industry representatives were correct in saying that “the solution to PhilHealth’s inability to use its funds is not to strip Filipinos of health care funding but to implement immediate and substantial PhilHealth reforms such as increasing the scope and coverage of benefits packages.”

Invoking “due diligence” is almost meaningless in ascertaining that the diverted funds exclude contributions of paying members when these are co-mingled? While the diversion was coordinated and guided by the Government Corporate Counsel, Governance Commission for GOCCs and the Commission on Audit, the alternative use to “invest in the nation’s economic growth and development particularly in government infrastructure and social programs” actually pits these items against public health in promoting economic development. We doubt whether these public agencies ever addressed the existential issue that public health is a matter of life and death, while infrastructure and other social services can wait for another day. 

We share the spirit of the letter of former Philippine health secretaries “to be sensitive to public opinion and exercise prudence and caution by not transferring the next tranche of funds and succeeding transfers” because it strikes at the very heart of public health issue. PhilHealth funds are better used to benefit, for instance, indigent patients who have to spend hours queuing at PCSO for some additional help. On the other hand, no one can take issue with the letter of former Philippine finance secretaries in support of the fiscal responsibility to optimize excess funds of public agencies. 

But the optimal use of public funds is not the issue here. It is PhilHealth’s failure to use its funds to provide health coverage to millions of Filipinos, it is PhilHealth’s incompetence in broadening public health benefits. There could only be bad fiscal management if PhilHealth continues to expand its treasury operations even as its payables to individuals and hospitals are mounting? If there are just too many unmet health needs, how can anyone assume there are excess funds in the first place?

And even assuming there are legitimate excess funds, or savings, to speak of, is the Finance department’s circularlegal or constitutional? Can the diversion of funds be properly done? 

Multisectoral opposition 1Sambayan led by Retired Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio and lawyer Howard Calleja argued that only the President is authorized by law to transfer savings from one item to another in the appropriations for the Executive Branch under the appropriations law. To 1Sambayan convenors, the delegation of power to a cabinet secretary to transfer savings from GOCCs to the Bureau of the Treasury is unconstitutional. That power exclusively belongs to the President. 

Thus, “the two transfers of idle or unused funds to date from PhilHealth result in technical malversation of public funds and constitute the crime of plunder.” 

Equally important, 1Sambayan maintained that PhilHealth’s funds are special funds raised through taxation for a specific purpose which is to promote the universal health of Filipinos. 

1Sambayan’s points also echoed in former Senator Panfilo Lacson who stressed that both PhilHealth Law and the Universal Health Care Act are special laws that specify how excess funds from the state insurer are to be used. 

Advocates led by Senate Minority Floor Leader Aquilino Pimentel III had already questioned the constitutionality of the rider in the budget law and the Finance circular itself before the Supreme Court.

If the National Government opted to reform the PhilHealth yesterday and compelled its adherence with its mandate of providing universal health care, there would have been no “excess” funds to begin with. There is nothing with which to fund infrastructure and social services, nothing to convert to 0.88 ppts in real output and 600,000 in additional jobs. 

Why, this could easily be done if Congress were to halve its unprogrammed appropriations and reduce the funding for non-priority projects.",0
140,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"Clear from the genealogy of PhilHealth is its continuing mandate to provide comprehensive and equitable health care. Policy-wise, there should be no more question that aside from quality education, effective public health is a good “strategy for bringing about faster economic development and improving quality of life.” It’s a direct, and no doubt, quick route to higher labor productivity and economic growth.

PhilHealth descended from martial law’s Medicare as administered by the Philippine Medical Care Commission pursuant to the Philippine Medical Care Act of 1969. Total coverage of medical services according to the needs of patients is its ultimate goal.  It was to be an evolving extension of medical care to all residents based obviously on the nation’s financial capability by mandating contribution to help build the medical care fund. 

The basic idea was first to leverage on both the SSS and GSIS medical programs while preparing to cover non-members on a compulsory and automatic basis. Not bad for a developing country in the late 1960s.

A National Health Insurance Program was established in 1995, mandating the creation of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and replacing the Commission as administrator. This law proceeds from the 1987 constitutional mandate for “an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all people at affordable cost.”

For the same reason, the Universal Healthcare (UHC) Law of 2019 automatically enrolled in PhilHealth all Filipino citizens, including overseas Filipino workers. This means any Filipino can avail himself of health care benefits even without a PhilHealth ID card. There is no better way to institutionalize universal health care than through a contributory health insurance scheme.

Yes, the operative words are accessibility and affordability. 

All citizens shall have access to health services at first “with at least a basic minimum package of health insurance benefits.” The law prioritizes a person’s health needs than his ability to pay based on the principle of risk sharing among various income and age groups. There is also unequivocal mandate for PhilHealth to contain cost to help the people afford healthcare services.

Since not every one of the 113-million Filipinos contributes to the fund, and medical cost is rising like crazy, health premium is not just enough even if it was recently jacked up. With a broad coverage of inpatient care, among others, budget support is essential. Funding is short even with contributions from PCSO and PAGCOR and from the budget itself of the Department of Health. 

For 2024, PhilHealth received more than a hundred-billion-peso budget to accommodate an expanded pool of beneficiaries and to sustain current programs. Some 1.31 million indigent and financially incapable patients are to receive medical assistance. With parallel efforts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other government programs, some 12.75 million indigent members are expected to be reached this year. 

This is far from universal even as the intent is. 

If past WHO data were to be a guide, PhilHealth has a lot of homework to do. With sustained population growth, life expectancy in the Philippines surprisingly declined from 69 years in 2000 to 66.4 years in 2021. In Western Pacific, comparable data actually rose from 72.4 years to 77.4 years. In this age, tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death for children below five. Why, this is a scourge of highly impoverished nations.

And if this is not enough, based on statistics from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the healthcare continues to be a big burden for households. Their out-of-pocket payment had the biggest share of 44.5 percent among the health care funding schemes in 2023, higher than government and voluntary healthcare system.

Comparing the Philippines with other ASEAN neighbors in terms of critical health outcome shows some embarrassing results. Three years ago, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies in a study prepared by research fellow Valerie Gilbert T. Ulip and research analyst Lyle Daryll D. Casas ('Regional Health Integration and Cooperation in the Philippines') concluded that we fell behind our ASEAN counterparts. Normally, health systems must have sufficient health facilities offering different types and levels of health services. 

This is not the case for the Philippines.

For instance, hospital beds are limited, short of 400,000 beds. Half of the Filipinos have no timely access to primary healthcare facilities. We spend only about 1.5 percent of GDP to health, really no comparison with Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Our handicap in health human resources is just enormous. Ten percent of our rural units have only one doctor each while many health facilities do not even have a nurse or a midwife. Finally, our public health capacity for emergencies is extremely low. WHO’s international health regulations gave us a score of only 53 percent, only better than Lao PDR and Cambodia.

No AI is necessary to draw the extent of the challenge for the health sector in the Philippines. There is so much ground to flesh out the universality, accessibility and affordability of healthcare system. 

Adding the regular contributions of members to subsidies from the national government and remittances from both PCSO and PAGCOR yields big, big shortfall. Yet, PhilHealth failed to spend all its money in 2024 to the tune of ₱89.9 billion. 

With dwindling fiscal space and burgeoning public debt that has exceeded the threshold of 60 percent of GDP against the commitment of NG to refrain from introducing new taxes or imposing higher taxes, the only recourse of government is to increase the dividend rate and sweep all “unused funds” from government-owned and controlled corporations.

Finance Secretary Ralph Recto was recently quoted by ABS-CBN News saying that the full remittance and appropriate use of PhilHealth’s ₱89.9 billion could add 0.88 ppts to national output and add 600,000 more jobs. Interesting quote, but first, can the remittance be properly done and second, how does one convert it to output and jobs?",0
141,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I need to half-digress from mainstream politics and the elections—only half, because my greatest concern is the dire learning poverty of our public-school students, which is not entirely apolitical. When Filipino students at ages 10 and 15 perform disastrously compared to their global peers, we catch a glimpse of the quality of our young workforce today and in the next 30 years.

The numbers are damning. In the 2022 World Bank Learning Poverty Brief, 91% of our 10-year-olds were classified as learning-poor. Meanwhile, in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), our 15-year-olds ranked second to last among ASEAN nations. These stark realities expose the deep crisis in Philippine education. Instead of the usual rhetoric about education being the path out of poverty, it has only widened the chasm between the rich and the poor. The underperforming majority comes from low-income backgrounds, while the small minority of high achievers comes from the wealthy.

With education failing as a viable escape from poverty, we must brace ourselves for prolonged economic hardship. I see no alternative. For centuries, since Spanish colonization, both the Church and the State have relied on ayuda as their primary response to poverty—whether through almsgiving or scholarships for a select few poor children.

Over time, ayuda has evolved into a full-fledged government program, backed by well-funded initiatives. It is estimated that cash transfers and subsidies for the poor amount to around 600 billion pesos, including the controversial AKAP program. The government has combined anti-poverty projects with traditional almsgiving under politically branded programs—essentially signaling that it “cares.”

Yet poverty persists, particularly food poverty, which affects up to 70% of the population. This proves that formalized almsgiving, in the form of cash assistance and subsidies, remains grossly inadequate as an anti-poverty strategy. These programs may be charitable at best, but they lack the power to foster development and self-reliance. In fact, the common criticism is that subsidies have only deepened dependency. Worse, they have not just made people more reliant on aid, but more reliant on the politicians who control access to these ayuda programs.

As we quietly do our part—despite believing that the primary responsibility lies with the government—we must first understand the most marginalized in our society. They are everywhere, but they remain concentrated in rural areas, on small farms and in impoverished fishing villages. These are the communities that have long been neglected. Decades ago, both government and big business rushed toward development in commerce and industry, leaving these rural populations behind. Seventy years later, they are still struggling to catch up.

We will also find that learning poverty is most severe in these same neglected agricultural areas, which continue to serve as a pipeline for future urban squatters. This rural-to-urban poverty cycle has fueled much of the rapid urbanization we see today. Yet, despite this clear pattern, we have failed to learn from it. The rural poor remain overlooked, and in turn, the ranks of the urban poor continue to swell.

Exacerbating both learning poverty and economic poverty is corruption. It is impossible to reverse these crises in isolation because corruption serves as the underlying catalyst for both. No matter how we attempt to address education or economic development, we cannot escape the fact that corruption lies at their very core.

For concerned Filipinos like myself, it is easy to list an overwhelming number of urgent issues. But what we need most are solutions. That brings our focus to three critical areas: education, economic productivity, and corruption—the force that festers within both. We may hesitate to openly discuss corruption, especially when we recognize that the billionaire elite and corporate conglomerates, alongside the government, are complicit—whether by greed, cooperation, or silent acceptance.

Yet, despite all this, not all hope is lost. In fact, today may offer the most promising opportunities for change. Throughout history, great thinkers have viewed the worst of times as the beginning of the best. The most profound transformations occur when they are needed most—when suffering and frustration reach a breaking point.

When good men and women feel most powerless, they are often on the brink of discovering their greatest strength. Time and again, history reminds us that ordinary people accomplish extraordinary feats, especially when survival is at stake. We recall countless stories of individuals who have displayed superhuman strength in moments of crisis—when they, or those they love, face life-or-death situations.

Most of us don’t see ourselves as being in a life-or-death situation—certainly not in the literal sense. As individuals, we may feel angry, frustrated, or exhausted from hard but unrewarding work. Many struggle with uncertainty over their next meal or the fear of falling ill without the means for medicine or medical care. But few would say they are at the edge of survival.

On a collective level, however, I believe we are approaching that point. We are becoming powerless against the moral and ethical decay eating away at the nobility of our culture and the values our ancestors painstakingly passed down through their sacrifices. Life is not just about our pockets, nor even just about our stomachs. As human beings, we yearn for something deeper—the spirit that sets us apart from all other life forms. Perhaps it is more than uniqueness; perhaps it is something divine.

Our spirit, our soul, our dignity, our nobility—these are integral to who we are. Without them, we would feel empty, even lifeless. But how do we sustain them when our values and actions have become barren? At what point does this struggle become a matter of life and death? When do we summon the superhuman strength that history tells us we possess?

When that moment comes, may the best in us rise from the shadows. Tayo, hindi si Batman, ang bahala.",0
142,Jose Ma Montelibano,"It is exhausting to stay focused on what I believe should be our nation’s real concerns when the environment is consumed by political drama rather than the pressing challenges to governance and societal growth. But these distractions are not just a part of life in the Philippines—they dominate it. We have no choice but to factor them into our daily landscape and learn to navigate around them.

We are facing a crisis in food security. This is nothing new, of course, but rarely does the government even admit its existence as clearly as it does today. The crisis, however, persists largely because of an even more fundamental flaw—our inability to produce essential food items despite our country’s fertile agricultural environment. We have all the necessary ingredients: land, water, climate, farmers, technology, and consumers. Yet, our agricultural output remains disappointingly low. It is no surprise, then, that poverty is most prevalent in rural areas, among small farmers, fisherfolk, and their families.

Compounding the failure of agricultural development is the failure of education. Poverty in the Philippines is no longer just an economic issue; it has taken over our education system and given rise to a new term—learning poverty. Our public school system has reached a crisis point, with a staggering 91% of ten-year-old students unable to read or comprehend age-appropriate texts. This crisis threatens the very future of our youth, undermining what should be an advantage—our growing young workforce. Instead of being a strength, this demographic is being weakened by a crippling learning deficit.

With millions already struggling to put food on the table, and tens of millions more fearing food insecurity, we do not have the luxury of time to confront these crises as a united people. Yet, we continue to be consumed by distractions—politics and elections.

Even as we face the alarming prospect of an underprepared workforce in the coming generations, our attention remains fixated on the political zarzuela of two feuding, destructive dynasties. Somehow, we fail to recognize that these political families are not the solution to our problems but rather the very cause of them. We need only look at the last nine years to measure the immense societal losses we have suffered.

At the heart of these losses is the worsening corruption in government. The Philippines’ corruption index had already fallen below 100, only to climb back up to 115—meaning corruption worsened between 2018 and 2024, the years of Duterte and Marcos. The cost of corruption is evident in the staggering foreign debts incurred by both administrations—each adding approximately P1 trillion per year, compared to just P1 trillion over the entire six years of the PNoy administration.

This growing corruption is not just a crisis; it must become a national conversation. It is as urgent and dangerous as the continued neglect of agriculture, the struggle of small farmers and fisherfolk, and the learning poverty that threatens to cripple the productivity of future generations.

With another election coming in May 2025, we are once again at a crossroads. It is another chance to change the course of our history—or to dig ourselves even deeper into the hole we are already in. If we continue to elect the same kind of leaders who have enabled the neglect of agriculture, the decline of education, and the worsening of corruption, then we can expect nothing but more of the same. Except this time, our suffering will be even worse because we have already lost so much. If we are to believe the many surveys circulating today, however, Filipinos seem to be blindly diving into an even darker abyss.

At the same time, I sense a definitive shift—an energy sweeping across the world, rapid and unpredictable, carrying the theme of change. I know the Philippines will not be exempt, though I cannot say if this shift will affect the coming elections. But I feel it, and I believe we must prepare for the unexpected.

This is why I choose to focus on what we can do individually and directly—on efforts to ease food insecurity, reduce poverty, and reform our education system. Politically, there is little I can do beyond voting for candidates who have a proven track record in small agriculture, education, and accountability. I already know who they are because they have consistently addressed these three urgent national concerns.

I have made a conscious effort to be objective in sharing my thoughts, avoiding what might seem like endorsements of specific candidates rather than the advocacies they stand for. But in the 2022 elections, I openly expressed my support for Leni Robredo because she embodied the most critical virtues for Filipino governance—transparency, accountability, sacrifice, and bayanihan. I feel no less convinced today about Bam Aquino for education, Kiko Pangilinan for agriculture, and Heidi Mendoza for accountability in fighting corruption. I pray for them, I pray for the Filipino people, and I pray for our nation.

At this moment, the forces struggling for control are failing to maintain it. Instead, their battles are only adding heat and friction to an already volatile political and economic environment—one that feels like dry powder, waiting for a spark. In other words, no one is truly in control in this hyperactive and combative landscape. It is a delicate moment in our history, but it will not stay this way for long. Something has to give—and it will.",0
143,Jose Ma Montelibano,"As expected, 2025 started with a bang—the same bang that echoed through 2024. Unfortunately, this is not the sound of celebratory fireworks, despite 2025 already witnessing two New Year celebrations. Instead, it is a bang laden with a heavy dampness—except, of course, for the billionaire class.

The greatest blunder that buried 2024 in deep disappointment and resentment was the signing of the 2025 national budget, or the General Appropriations Act (GAA). Whatever goodwill the Marcos presidency had managed to generate could not neutralize the negative impact of a budget that continues to simmer with controversy. It is not just about the amounts allocated but about the arbitrary and reckless decisions—deflating critical budgets while inflating favored programs. The unexplained cuts and bloated political pork have only fueled public distrust instead of instilling the confidence Filipinos desperately need as the year unfolds.

In my article last week, I described our current state as being “at a low and fragile point.” I thought that was the gentlest way to put it, given that others have been more scathing. After all, the regular SWS surveys show self-rated poverty at its worst in two decades, now at 63%. Food poverty figures are equally alarming, and government agencies are finally talking about prioritizing food security. Inflation is reported at deceptively low levels, yet the majority of Filipinos struggle to afford three full meals a day due to shockingly high food prices.

As we enter the second month of 2025, I had hoped we could focus on how we—ordinary yet the majority of Filipinos—can help ourselves when the government cannot. But this can only happen if we are not constantly distracted by political feuds and reactionary squabbles. With the House of Representatives impeaching VP Sara Duterte, with the official campaign period now beginning, these distractions will only worsen. It is not a good time for Filipinos, and it is not a good time for the world either.

But I exclude the billionaire class from these economic and political woes. The wealth, power, and opportunities they possess shield them from the daily struggles of ordinary Filipinos. The Philippines, after all, recorded economic growth higher than most countries. But where did that growth come from? More importantly, where did it go? When economic growth coincides with deepening poverty and food insecurity, the answer is clear: that wealth has flowed upward, enriching the billionaire class and their business associates while leaving the masses behind.

It is a cliché—one that remains powerfully true—that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. But in the Philippine context, this is not just a cliché; it is a political indictment. It means the government has failed in its most essential role: to lead its people toward collective well-being. When continuous economic growth translates to greater poverty and food insecurity, the government is not leading—it is merely catering to the rich and powerful, clinging to a failed trickle-down economy.

Development must meaningfully and substantially include the 63% of Filipinos at the bottom. The principle of ayuda is not inherently wrong—after all, the Catholic Church and the elite have used it for centuries. But it is ineffective beyond addressing immediate hunger. A real development strategy must go beyond short-term relief and move toward self-sufficiency. Protecting the weak may start with feeding and sheltering them, but it must evolve into empowering them.

This means no ayuda without a structured development plan that fosters responsibility, hard work, and productivity. It requires all sectors—government, business, private institutions, and education—to create a sustainable framework for lifting Filipinos out of dependence. Our widespread dependency, the staggering 91% learning poverty, the inability of public-school teachers to deliver effective education, corruption in government, the neglect of small farmers and fisherfolk, and the decline of patriotism—these are all interconnected ailments. They must be addressed under one comprehensive vision and mission.

The accumulated rot is seeping through, as it was always bound to. We cannot continue making blunder after blunder, driven by greed rather than service and the common good, without paying the price. And we have been paying for it—wasting opportunity after opportunity to grow from our native resources, intelligence, and noble culture. We have reversed the natural order, turning ourselves into the world’s service provider at the cost of our own dignity. Again, of course, I exempt the billionaire class, who continue to thrive many times over while those who need to thrive the most fall further behind.

Recent COA reports expose the inefficiency of project implementation in agencies like NIA, DPWH, PAGASA, and NFA. COA is not yet alleging corruption, only mismanagement and waste. But we have heard the same about DepEd, PhilHealth, and Customs. It is only a matter of time before every other agency is publicly exposed—not just for inefficiency, which likely already exists, but for outright corruption. The rot will seep through, as surely as night follows day.

I want to speak directly to the mainstream Filipino—the poor, as well as those who consider themselves neither poor nor rich. We must reclaim our sense of shame and restore what we have lost: our dignity, our talents, and our fierce drive to take care of ourselves. We suffer the most, yet we surrender our freedom and agency to a government that prioritizes the elite. We search for solutions and saviors, but rarely do we look to ourselves.

I also want to address the billionaire class. There are countless justifications for accumulating wealth—even obscene amounts of it—while most Filipinos struggle for life’s essentials. But may I ask: please, grow a conscience.

And finally, to the government. You are the father, mother, big brother, protector, enabler, the last refuge of Filipinos in need—and most Filipinos are now in need. Patriotism demands the highest standards from you. Do not take the lowest road and become the treacherous bantay-salakay.",0
144,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I suspect I’ve been infected by one of the flu-like viruses currently surging in China, though our own Department of Health (DOH) insists there’s no cause for alarm. In other words, there’s no pandemic, no epidemic, and no new or old variant of COVID-19—just human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Our medical authorities seem intent on downplaying its severity, reminding us that we’re simply in flu season, an annual cycle.

It will take a long time before I can trust the DOH again. During the pandemic, corruption tainted every major expense—from overpriced COVID-19 tests and vaccines to the misuse of PhilHealth funds for emergency medical supplies that were never even utilized. And to think the pandemic was also used as justification to borrow trillions more in debt.

But I digress from my own insignificant health issue to one of the greatest plunders our country has ever seen—one I’ve grown tired of hoping will be resolved. Instead, I’ll focus on HMPV, which has been wreaking havoc on children and senior citizens, causing flu-like symptoms that linger for weeks, even months. Not deadly, if we are to believe the DOH, but apparently not serious enough to warrant a national awareness campaign on prevention and treatment.

In other words, we are on our own. Filipinos must seek remedies wherever they can, hoping they don’t stumble upon something effective yet unlicensed by the DOH and FDA—lest the source be legally harassed. I remember the first year of the pandemic when, despite offering no curative solutions, the DOH and FDA were quick to discredit alternatives like Ivermectin, which pharmaceutical giants disapproved of.

To help myself, I left the unhealthy environment of Metro Manila for a few days and retreated to the foothills of a majestic mountain. I hoped the fresh air would help, even though the high humidity wasn’t ideal. Still, the much cooler climate—ranging from 18 to 25°C—helped my body recover, while the quiet, only occasionally broken by distant crowing roosters, soothed my mind and spirit.

But like many Filipinos who know their health fares better outside the country’s urban centers, my options are limited. I am no billionaire. And as a senior citizen, my body is more exhausted, and my life savings, like those of many others, are not limitless. That means returning to a polluted metropolis, taking solace in the company of my grandchildren, and bracing myself for the hyperactive noise of traditional and social media—both of which seem to be a curse on any senior’s pursuit of serenity. Like a rocket that has wandered into deep space, I must now prepare for re-entry.

Life on Earth for a Senior Citizen

What is life like for a senior citizen like me? For someone deeply concerned with the socio-political landscape of the Philippines, full retirement is out of the question. The nagging thought remains: Have we done enough? The answer is usually no. Then comes the harder question: What can we do with the lessons we’ve learned—mostly the hard way—and how do we pass them on to younger socio-political advocates?

At the same time, life urges us to let go—to turn inward, not in a selfish way, but toward deeper self-reflection. Yet this is no easy task. We have spent so much time immersed in the noisy, external world that detaching from it feels unnatural. And it’s even harder to step away when the causes we have fought for remain vital to building a better society.

Should advocates simply abandon the struggles they’ve dedicated decades to? Would focusing on the spiritual—on possible life after death—be a distraction from making life better for those still here and those who will come after us? Or is it possible to balance inner contemplation with meaningful advocacy?

A Collective Responsibility

As much as I acknowledge that the state of our country is at a low and fragile point, I also know that the answer isn’t me—it’s us. A national dilemma requires collective effort, where each person contributes something better: better behavior, better productivity, better vision. Only then can we shift the national trajectory. The odds are against us because reversing a bad pattern is always the hardest and most painful task.

But this realization brings me peace. I cannot carry the burden of change alone because the problem is collective. Yet I also understand that even small, personal efforts—if successful—contribute strategically to the whole. The challenge is not to do it all, nor even to do too much, but to trust that every seemingly small contribution matters. This is the secret sauce of democracy.

I have taken a brief yet powerful respite in an environment that refreshes me—where the air is pure, the waters are clean, and solitude offers a healing magic. That alone is a great blessing. I wish the same for others, wherever they may find their own places of refuge.

A great journey beckons, and we must face it with courage and strength.",0
145,Jose Ma Montelibano,"While they are not new phenomena, the persistence of poverty and corruption remains deeply troubling, both as significant issues in their own right and due to the ineffectiveness of the measures taken to address them. These twin scourges effectively stifle any potential for widespread progress and prosperity, instead ensuring that such benefits are reserved for a select few. The enormity of poverty and corruption renders them national crises, yet it has become increasingly clear that national strategies are failing to make a dent.

In the Philippines, the seeming intractability of poverty and corruption can be largely attributed to the lack of effective law enforcement. Despite having a substantial police force, a broad judiciary, and a vast bureaucracy, their size does not translate into efficiency. They are present in large numbers, yet they fall short in carrying out their duties with competence. Consequently, the disparity and social injustice that poverty and corruption embody continue to fester, eroding the fabric of society.

But this, too, is nothing new. It is such a recurring state of affairs that many are discouraged from efforts to resolve them. The decline of the Philippines, traced all the way back to the 60s, saw it toppled from its elevated position among Asian countries until where it is today somewhere near the bottom of the barrel. All sorts of prognoses and analysis point out to one consistent factor among several, and that is corruption. It is not about the corruption of the many, it is about the corruption of the few who rule through formal authority, wealth, influence, or force.

My deepening interest in the study of societal life has been fueled by the narratives and research of historians, anthropologists, and behavioral scientists. I’ve also sought insight from the wisdom of the ancients, whose teachings have been revered by many cultures around the globe. In times of uncertainty and fear, merely skimming the surface of current events seldom provides clarity. Yet, by examining the cycles of history, we can discern echoes of the past in our present – patterns that seem to recur, pleading for a more profound understanding.

It is a natural human response for those who are frustrated to yearn for immediate solutions to the pressing issues that plague their daily lives. However, we often overlook the fact that quick fixes have consistently fallen short or even exacerbated the problems. Persisting with approaches that have repeatedly failed ensures a continuation of that failure, yet breaking free from this destructive loop proves challenging for many. It dangerously invites an innovative, even radical approach—sometimes from an external source—to interrupt the cycle.

Our domestic instability is further intensified by global volatility. As our political leaders engage in internal squabbles, the international landscape fares no better. It’s crucial to acknowledge our embarrassing reliance on the economic and political climates of other nations, as their troubles inevitably exacerbate our own vulnerabilities. Consider the significant revenue that overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) contribute to the nation and their families, or the business that foreign clients of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) firms bring to our economy, bolstering national income and providing jobs for Filipino workers.

The urgency for a national vision and movement to recalibrate our foundational principles cannot be overstated. We cannot afford to prioritize real estate development on our lands over enhancing them for increased food production. Our survival hinges on empowering our rural communities and harnessing the productivity of our lands and seas to sustain ourselves independently. We must honor the natural gifts bestowed upon us, rather than racing to become one of the world’s largest food importers.

As we revel in the blessings of our naturally abundant land, I hold firm in the belief that we are a people graced with intelligence, creativity, and an innate ability for human connection and service. It is with profound sadness and frustration that I observe the squandered potential of our bountiful resources and our talented populace, which have been met not with appreciation and cultivation, but with exploitation and neglect.

The plight of Filipino farmers and fisherfolk stands as a testament to this neglect, their invaluable contributions undervalued and overlooked in favor of imported sustenance. This same pattern of disregard extends to the nurturing of our children, whose natural intelligence and talent contrast starkly with a learning poverty rate of 91%. This dire statistic paints a grim narrative of neglect, abuse, and exploitation, casting a shadow over the future of our nation—a future inextricably linked to the well-being and development of our youth.

I am convinced that no vision or movement can truly resonate with and galvanize the Filipino people unless it acknowledges and builds upon the inherent strengths and capabilities of our land and our people. We cannot flourish by striving to become something we are not. My fervent hope is that a new wave of concerned and patriotic Filipino leaders will emerge—from our barangays, towns, and cities, from our farms and offices, from our schools and churches—leaders who understand that we must unite to confront our fears and aspirations.

The challenges we face as a people and a nation transcend the divisions of politics and governance. The landscape is cluttered with the cacophony of opposition, yet the voices of those who suffer the most, whether from material want or the moral desolation that pervades, are too faint. We need a national dialogue to address our collective burdens. To allow the turbulent winds of confusion and discontent to dictate our course of action would be an act of recklessness.

We can start on a modest scale, forming close-knit groups, until we collectively recognize the shared problems, the shared good, and the shared aspirations. Change is within our grasp, but there must be enough of us to initiate the journey toward it.",0
146,Jose Ma Montelibano,"There is no urgent need any more for me to alert people about the erratic and turbulent tendencies for life in 2025. I have been consistently pointing to it these last few years because the pattern had started earlier. In fact, the 2020 Covid 19 pandemic could not have been a louder warning about the disruption about to unfold.

Recent events in the last month that includes the sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, the political upsets in France and even Germany, the spread and relentlessness of Israel’s retaliation for their horrible October 27 experience, the shocking shooting of a civilian airline as it crossed Russian airspace, the fiery crash of another airline triggered by a bird strike in South Korea, the great earthquake in Tibet, and the raging fires that destroyed so much in Los Angeles and still not totally controlled, are glaring and graphic examples of a dark global pattern. I assume Filipinos are smart enough to intuit that these are not friendly times.

Yet, life goes on. It matters little if problems are solved or further deteriorate because life will go on. What should concern us is how to navigate an unfriendly environment and make things easier for ourselves instead of just going with a negative flow. The problems that plague the world, and the Philippines, are of a scale that is beyond our individual capacity to address – unless we focus on our own capacities and pick our battles. Because the great collective can be broken down into the little individualities – we just have to trust that many others will do their part.

Most of us will deal with survival problems, about 63% of Filipino families who have most recently rated themselves poor. Luckily, 26% regard themselves as not poor (though down from 28% previously). 11% look at themselves as borderline poor, which for me means they are most vulnerable to becoming poor. But if we add the 11% borderline poor to the 63% self-rated poor, that is a whopping 74%. How does a country formulate a progressive vision considering the deep contrast of 74% poor and 26% non-poor? Do we have a leadership that knows how to manage a society with great economic and educational gaps?

It is not prudent for us to wait for visionary leadership, let alone inspiring leadership. Our current situation is a result of years without such leadership. Fear has driven us, but true growth only comes from higher aspirations. We lack a collective cause to fight for, a national leadership to guide us.

Despite this, life goes on and we must continue moving forward. Merely riding the tide has led us to desolate shores. We cannot allow our future generations to suffer in a troubled country within an equally troubled world. We must gather as concerned Filipinos, prioritize our urgent survival needs, and find ways to increase productivity and decrease costs through collective efforts.

Food, shelter, utilities, and health are essential. Collaboration among farmers, fisherfolks, and local communities is crucial. Government support from the Department of Agriculture and Department of Trade would be beneficial, but cooperation with local government units (LGUs) is more immediate. Community agriculture and connecting with food enthusiasts, such as the slow food movement, are vital pathways to explore.

Addressing food and income economics is paramount, as is investing in education for both short- and long-term benefits. Learning poverty and the inadequacy of teaching must be confronted head-on. A national dialogue and debate on these issues is imperative. We cannot wait for leaders to take action; we must initiate change and invite them to join us.

While our leaders may have other pressing concerns, such as upcoming elections, family feuds, global dynamics, and climate change, we must prioritize addressing our nation’s fundamental challenges. Only through collective action and a sense of urgency can we hope to overcome poverty and build a brighter future for all Filipinos.

We stand at a pivotal juncture. Lacking are leaders endowed with vision, integrity, and the allure of charisma. Those at the helm are perceived as being driven predominantly by a thirst for power and the pursuit of personal wealth. The archetypes we once revered, steeped in tradition and culture, now seem absent. The prospect of reform or advancement seems bleak under the stewardship of those who have plunged us into this yearning for sincere and forward-thinking governance.

Therefore, we must look inward—toward ourselves—and to the fate that unfolds, hoping it might reveal the heralds of our time. While destiny will take its course, we cannot afford to sit idly by, waiting for deliverance, before we strive for our own survival and carve out whatever prosperity we can from life. This is a truth I will reiterate time and again: we are the foremost solution to our challenges, yet we must act collectively, with unity of purpose.

Currently, our solidarity can only be drawn from our shared convictions. We may not have a Pied Piper, a Joan of Arc, or a Jose Rizal to lead us, but we all yearn for their nobility, their integrity, their bravery. Our unity must be forged in the pursuit of what is right, in our shared welfare. There may simply be no other way.",0
147,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I almost didn’t want to write an article this week. The Christmas season, as marked by the traditional calendar, ended with the Epiphany—what we used to call the Feast of the Three Kings. Over the past few weeks, buoyed by memories of my personal history and the festive spirit of Christmas 2024 and New Year 2025, I managed to lift myself above the political chaos of the past year. But now, a sense of foreboding about what lies ahead weighs on me.

This apprehension isn’t about political partisanship—there’s no need for that. Most Filipinos who aren’t part of the elite circles of immense wealth and influence share the same anxiety. While the privileged few may not be completely immune to the challenges ahead, their resources provide a cushion to soften the blows of political and economic crises. For the rest of us, preparation—both material and psychological—is imperative.

We closed last year with what I can only describe as a bizarre national budget. Professor Cielo Magno, an expert in the field, didn’t mince words and called it “the most corrupt national budget ever.” Without her level of expertise, I simply find it laughable—but in a way that makes you want to cry. It’s a budget designed not for national interests, but for politicians in the Palace, Congress, the Senate, their sycophants, the DPWH and its contractors, and the DSWD, where vast sums of ayuda will flow. Let’s not forget the public officials who cling to their confidential and intelligence funds. This budget serves vested interests, not the people.

Meanwhile, questions about the use—or misuse—of PhilHealth funds refuse to fade away. Our education system fares no better. Learning poverty threatens the quality of labor and productivity for generations to come, yet DepEd faces budget cuts. We need an actionable framework to reverse this crisis, and it cannot hinge on teacher salary increases alone. Higher pay is essential but insufficient unless it translates to improved knowledge and skills among students in public schools.

And then there’s agriculture, a perennial horror story. For decades, small farmers and fisherfolk have struggled while importers and big businesses thrive. National leadership remains woefully incapable of charting a different course. The Masagana 99 program of the 1970s had potential, but corruption derailed it, nearly bankrupting the rural banking system. Half a century later, nothing has changed except ballooning budgets, rising corruption indices, and unchecked confidential funds.

As midterm elections approach, the lingering questions surrounding the 2022 presidential elections cast a long shadow. The Comelec and the National Government insist all is well, yet simple requests—like opening ballot boxes to match physical and electronic results—are denied. Why? What harm is there in basic transparency? This refusal reeks of arrogance and a deliberate lack of accountability.

Speaking of accountability, the same standards being demanded of VP Sara Duterte regarding the use of confidential funds should apply to everyone: the President, the former President, and all other officials entrusted with public money. Billions in confidential and intelligence funds must be audited to ensure they serve national interests, not personal enrichment.

Professor Cielo Magno has shed light on how a national budget can be twisted until it reeks of corruption. Similarly, former COA Commissioner Heidi Mendoza could educate us on the primacy of accountability in public service. These two respected UP professors exemplify expertise and integrity—qualities we desperately need in our leaders. Their insights could validate the substantial public investment in the University of the Philippines.

But even as we look to individuals like them, we must remember that the ultimate responsibility lies with us. We must learn from their example and strive to embody the same values. Leaders reflect the people they serve. If we tolerate dishonesty, our leaders will be dishonest. If we are too afraid to uphold our principles, that fear will be weaponized against us.

Last week, I wrote that heroism is the only thing standing between us and ruin—not the grand, life-risking heroism we associate with revolutions, but the quiet, everyday kind. It’s the heroism of being more productive today than yesterday because the stakes are higher now. It’s the heroism that makes us love our lands, mountains, seas, keep them healthy so they can feed and protect us.

It’s the heroism of caring for the elderly and the vulnerable in our communities, of rekindling the bayanihan spirit. It’s the heroism of caring for the young and the poor, taking them out not only from hunger but helplessness, the heroism of developing their capacity to be strong and ultimately independent.

It’s the heroism of simple honesty in thought, word, and deed—the kind our ancestors wove into the fabric of our culture. It’s the heroism that will not accept compromises to integrity, and the heroism to reward good deeds and elevate the common good.

Let us embrace that heroism. It is ours to claim.",0
148,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I blinked, and it’s New Year! Somehow, 2025 has arrived without a bang, much like 2024 quietly ended. Yet, a new year signifies another beginning, regardless of how the previous one concluded or how unchanged things may appear. This time, however, we cannot let the mere turn of the calendar dictate how we approach 2025. We must will the change—good values, good people, and good progress. It will not come unbidden; it must be earned and demanded.

The 2025 budget, sadly, reflects rapacious priorities rather than a genuine commitment to education and health. I had thought education was universally acknowledged as the primary path out of poverty and that health was both an urgent necessity and a political imperative. Apparently, I overestimated the power of logic and compassion to temper political greed and ambition. Even in my seventies, despite witnessing plunderers and murderers at the pinnacle of power, I still fail to learn that hope alone does not suffice.

This is why I must summon greater willpower to actively shape the outcomes I seek, rather than passively wait for life to gift them to me. Striking the delicate balance between individual initiative and collective responsibility remains a challenge. Life is, after all, a ceaseless interplay of the personal and the universal—a dance between self-interest and the common good.

Yet, history reminds us that prioritizing personal gain over collective welfare breeds division, misunderstanding, and resentment. When we elevate what separates us above what unites us, we create a world of many losers and few winners. This, unfortunately, has been humanity’s default setting: the triumph of force over the supremacy of principle.

The ideals of democracy, as introduced by our American teachers over a century ago, offered a vision of equality, liberty, and the common good. The lessons were so compelling that we began to dream of what was not yet within our grasp. However, democracy demands something we often neglect: the hard work and discipline required to produce the fruits of collective labor. The more each citizen contributes to society’s well-being, the more there is for democracy to distribute.

Yet, Philippine democracy—designed to be inclusive and welcoming—has fallen victim to its own openness. The framers of our Constitution assumed that democracy thrives when it allows almost anyone to seek public office. This noble ideal has, instead, opened the door to incompetence and opportunism. Over the decades, this flawed assumption has inflicted incalculable harm on a fledgling democracy struggling to mature.

The quality of leadership in the Philippines has steadily declined throughout our 80-year experiment with self-governance. What began with promise under American tutelage deteriorated swiftly after independence in 1946. From a conjugal dictatorship to leaders who plundered the nation’s wealth, our history is littered with missed lessons and unlearned warnings. Instead of reform, greed and ambition found new ways to corrupt the system, emboldened by the lack of accountability and a citizenry too often resigned to its fate.

And so here we are, at the dawn of 2025, burdened by the persistent weight of history. It is enough to break the spirit but surrender only deepens our misery. Despite the odds, those who believe in a democracy rooted in the common good, national interest, and love of country have no choice but to forge hope from despair.

How this can be achieved remains a contentious question. What is certain, however, is that it will require pain, sacrifice, and relentless resolve. Without lofty aspirations, unshakable courage, and firmly grounded principles, we will falter. Blood, sweat, and tears—these are the unavoidable costs of the mission ahead.

Regrettably, many will choose not to join this struggle. For some, it will seem easier to surrender the noble for the mundane, to trade principle for survival, or to participate in the very exploitation they despise. I cannot wholly blame them, even knowing they enable the corrupt and criminal. Perhaps divine justice will teach them the lessons that human logic cannot. In the end, we must trust in the Creator and the natural order when reason fails to quell our doubts and fears.

What is required of Filipino patriots today is heroism. Yet heroism comes in many forms, and not all are grand or dramatic. We need not be martyred like Jose Rizal, betrayed like Andres Bonifacio, or lead uprisings like Gabriela Silang. Beneath their celebrated acts of bravery were quiet virtues that defined their lives—virtues they refused to compromise. They loved freedom, cherished their country, and upheld their noble principles even at the cost of their lives.

At the very least, it is this quiet heroism that must fuel our hearts. It can manifest in small yet profound ways: being honest in our dealings, and more importantly, remaining honest when dishonesty seems the easier path. It can mean working diligently—on the farm, in the factory, or at the office—doing our fair share without resorting to lies or shortcuts. And during the political season, it can mean recognizing, supporting, and uplifting fellow Filipinos who aspire to serve with integrity, even when they offer no favors, promises, or material gifts.

If we dream of a proud and prosperous Philippines, then pride and prosperity must start with us. If we long for a noble and productive nation, our contributions must embody nobility and productivity. And if we envision a brave and resilient country, then our courage must light the way.

A new year brings the chance for new beginnings, and we have the opportunity to fill it with our purest resolutions. We may falter, stumble, or lose our way at times, but what matters is that we rise again—to be honest again, to work hard again, and to persevere. 2025 may not promise happiness, but it can be a year of purpose—a year that plants the seeds of a brighter, more hopeful future.",0
149,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I write this first draft after over 24 hours of celebrating Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Once again, Christmas has lifted my spirits from what has been a challenging and often disheartening year. I hope this is true for many Filipinos who have endured economic struggles.

2024 has not been kind. But whether kind or not, the year has marched on, impervious to human efforts to slow it down. Through good news and bad, time pressed forward, and now, we are turning its final page. Despite the hardships, I witnessed how the Christmas spirit, tentative in September, finally broke through to dominate December. Thank you, Christmas, for reminding us that hope endures.

This is not the moment to dwell on what went wrong. We know the struggles; we have lived them. Instead, we deserve this reprieve—a time to come together not to argue or debate but to savor the best of family and friendship. In these moments, darkness recedes, and light breaks through: the smiles, the laughter, the hugs, and the rare sense of peace amidst the festivities.

Rest is a reward in itself. Week after week, as I write and share my thoughts on public issues, I am emotionally engaged with the events and people I write about. While objectivity demands clarity and facts, true insight requires understanding human sentiments and behavior. I strive for accuracy and balance, but my values ultimately shape how I present my opinions.

Christmas, for me, is a strategic pause. It shifts my perspective on current events and the collective trajectory of life. The negativities of the year—visible, grating, and deeply troubling—were undeniable. Yet Christmas came, bringing joy and hope, reminding us that light persists even in dark times.

At its core, Christmas is about Jesus Christ. Without Him, there would be no Christmas. Whether we are Christians or not, this historical truth matters. In the Philippines, Christmas holds special significance, transcending religion to unite us in shared celebration and hope.

But soon, the celebrations will fade. In just a few weeks, the euphoria will give way to a longing for the season to linger, only to be interrupted by the daily grind of work, school, and politics. Little by little, the shadows of negativity will encroach, competing with and eventually overpowering the inspiration of Christmas.

It will be a year until Christmas 2025, but the gift of this season lingers in its affirmation of innocence. The Holy Child embodies the innocence inherent in all of us—an innocence we may have discarded or polluted but that remains part of our nature. Recognizing and reclaiming this innocence is essential. It is not easily activated, but it is there, waiting to shield us from the corruption that undermines our integrity and cultural values.

This is why we must turn our focus to the youth. While we lament the loss of role models among our leaders, we must acknowledge the slim odds of reform within the entrenched systems they dominate. The idealism of the young, rooted in their unsullied innocence, is a formidable force for change.

For compromised adults, reclaiming integrity is no easy task. Guilt alone seldom leads to genuine repentance and atonement. The older generations need the youth to ignite the movement toward a return to honesty and integrity—not just in governance but in the home and community as well. The shining idealism of the youth can inspire a nation and lay the foundation for a reformist environment.

I am deeply disillusioned with the failures of formal leadership across nearly every field of human endeavor. Bright spots exist, but they are rare among those in elevated positions of power. The way forward lies in multiplying these bright spots, empowering the enlightened middle class, and sparking generational revolutions.

We cannot afford to let Christmas fade into obscurity. Its power, innocence, and promise must not be wasted. Above all, we must not forget its lessons. Darkness looms, with political drama and looming elections threatening to distract us from our responsibilities as citizens of a democratic nation.

Soon, we will hear endless promises from candidates—promises destined to be broken like so many before them. We will be bombarded with proposals claiming to save us, when, in truth, we must save ourselves from them. Rarely, if ever, will we hear of leaders who aim to empower citizens to contribute meaningfully to our collective progress.

As we face the challenges ahead, let us hold on to the hope and innocence of this Christmas season. These are the shields we need to navigate the difficult path forward and reclaim the integrity and light that define us as a people.

Strong shields are necessary for the immediate journey beyond Christmas. While we are concerned about the Philippines, a greater world is out there driven by anger and fear, many already writhing in pain. All of them in varying degrees impact upon our collective lives in the Philippines. Our trials and challenges are national, regional, global.

Let us remember to find the answers in ourselves, our capacity to produce, to stand on our own two feet in courage, not fear, and take care of one another as much as we can. Much is asked of us, and we must not fail.",0
150,Jose Ma Montelibano,"PhilHealth is not about its organization, infrastructure, institutional expertise, or even its funds. It embodies a dream—a material lifeline for survival. This dream may not be shared by all Filipinos, but it represents the hopes of many in the middle class, the ordinary, and the poor. PhilHealth represents a critical dream for the survival of many Filipinos, yet it is under threat by those in power who have never needed it.

Unfortunately, in the Philippines, there exists a privileged minority who can afford healthcare without needing PhilHealth. For them, what is PhilHealth when they can fly to Singapore, Europe, or the United States to receive top-tier medical treatment? This disparity is unfortunate because, unless they show genuine concern for the Filipinos who cannot access such privileges, they only exacerbate the struggles of the majority.

It is even more troubling that the key decision-makers in the House of Representatives, the Senate, and Malacañang Palace are part of this privileged minority. They do not depend on PhilHealth funds or resources to access the best medical care. This creates an anomaly: decisions about PhilHealth’s fate are made by those who have no stake in it. This is not representative democracy—it is autocracy or oligarchy.

For decades, since gaining independence from direct foreign rule in 1946, the perennial challenge of Philippine governance has been how to serve the interests of the majority. These majority interests are synonymous with national interests. In contrast, the interests of the wealthy minority fall into the category of special or vested interests.

Special or vested interests, in themselves, are not inherently wrong; they are normal for those who hold them. However, when these interests override or subvert national interests, they become criminal or even treasonous. Today, we face a dangerous reality: those with special or vested interests now hold the power to decide over matters of national importance, such as PhilHealth.

In our pursuit of national interests, our fledgling democracy has always had to be vigilant, exerting both awareness and political will to protect these interests from being undermined by the privileged few. National interests should always take precedence, as they represent the vast majority. Yet, the concentration of power and authority in the hands of a minority with special interests disrupts the ideal balance needed for a just and functional society.

The struggle for truly representative governance has always been measured by the levels of corruption and poverty in the country. Over the past 70 years, successive administrations have attempted—whether through lip service or sincere effort—to address these twin challenges. Each Filipino must critically assess how well each administration has performed in reducing corruption and poverty and vote for leaders accordingly.

Looking back at our nation’s journey since independence, the overall performance has been disappointing. Why? Fundamentally, the measure of independence lies in how free and empowered each Filipino feels today. Judging by the growing reliance on ayuda (government aid) and the stagnation of human development, it is clear that our progress has been dismal. The cumulative performance of our leaders in the so-called independence game has been nothing short of shameful.

I wonder if our political and business leaders are aware that we are deep in the Christmas season, with Christmas Day just around the corner. These weeks are supposed to be the happiest and most hopeful time of the year. If there is already noticeable dissent and resentment in the air, it suggests that the underlying situation is far worse than it appears. By the second half of January, when the positivity of Christmas fades, we may face an even more troubling reality.

The Filipino people are no longer overly ambitious. They still dream, but many know their dreams are unlikely to come true—or will only come true if they leave the Philippines. However, there are minimum aspirations that Filipinos cling to, no matter how difficult life becomes: food and health security. To frustrate these basic needs is to play with fire.

Food and health are not just aspirations; they are survival factors—primal and urgent. There is one more hope that keeps many Filipinos going: the belief that education can free their children from the hardships they have endured. This hope, though fragile, is anchored in the aspiration that the next generation might have a better life.

The national budget must prioritize these three essential concerns: food, health, and education. When Filipinos see their leaders focusing on these fundamental needs, they are often more patient and forgiving. But to exploit or pollute these priorities is to risk triggering indignation and unrest, like a spark igniting a dormant social and political volcano. I pray that the country’s leaders remain sensitive to these issues and avoid serious missteps in these areas.

There have been moments in our history when quiet disappointment and resentment boiled over, reaching a point of no return. It seems we have not learned those lessons well, as anxiety is once again building. This unease is being stoked by the political fracas between the Marcos and Duterte factions. The powder keg is dry, so to speak. The cost of living has become unbearable for many, and trust in honest governance is eroding rapidly.

It is clear to me that we, the people, are our only saviors. Let this Christmas bring families closer together and realize that the times ahead are difficult. We must confront the storm together, help one another, increase what we can do for the good of our families and community to strengthen our food and health security. Let Christmas awaken in us not only the joy of the season, but especially kindness and the sense of community.",0
151,Phind Instant,"The Persistent Shadow of Income Inequality in the Philippines

Income inequality stands as one of the Philippines' most enduring social and economic challenges, casting a long shadow over the nation's development trajectory. Despite periods of economic growth, the gap between the wealthy elite and the struggling masses remains stark, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting the country's full potential for inclusive development.

Historical Patterns and Structural Barriers

The Philippines holds the unfortunate distinction of having the highest income inequality among ASEAN nations. This disparity is particularly evident in the distribution of wealth, where historical patterns reveal a persistent concentration of resources among the elite. As documented by the Asian Development Bank, the richest 20% of Filipino families account for approximately 53% of total family income, while the poorest 80% must share the remaining 47%.

This severe imbalance is further highlighted by the striking ratio between the wealthiest and poorest segments of society. The income of the richest 10% of households stands at nearly 20 times that of the poorest 10%, demonstrating one of the most pronounced wealth gaps in Southeast Asia.

Regional Disparities and Labor Market Dynamics

While regional differences often dominate discussions of inequality, research reveals that intraregional disparities contribute approximately 82% of overall inequality. This finding challenges conventional wisdom and suggests that solutions must focus primarily on addressing inequalities within regions rather than between them.

Labor market dynamics play a crucial role in perpetuating income inequality:

•        Labor force participation rates significantly impact inequality, contributing 15.9% to total inequality
•        Employment rates show minimal disparity between income groups, suggesting that job creation alone won't significantly reduce inequality
•        Labor productivity emerges as the primary driver of inequality, accounting for 33.4% of labor income disparities.

Agricultural Sector Challenges

The agricultural sector presents unique challenges to addressing income inequality. Land distribution remains severely skewed, with historical patterns persisting despite reform efforts. Research indicates that initial land distribution significantly influences long-term economic growth and human development performance. This perpetuates cycles of poverty among rural communities, where farmers often remain landless and vulnerable to economic shocks.

Impact on Economic Growth

Income inequality doesn't merely reflect economic challenges; it actively impedes sustainable development. High levels of inequality weaken economic growth potential and slow poverty reduction rates compared to neighboring nations. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where limited economic opportunities perpetuate inequality, which in turn constrains broader economic advancement.

Moving Forward: Recommendations for Action

Breaking this cycle of inequality requires a multi-pronged approach:

1. Education and Skills Development - Investment in human capital programs
  - Vocational training initiatives
  - Enhanced access to quality education


2. Labor Market Reform - Policies supporting labor force participation
  - Productivity-enhancing programs
  - Protection of workers' rights


3. Agricultural Sector Reform - Implementation of effective land reform programs
  - Support for small farmers
  - Modernization of agricultural practices


4. Social Protection Programs - Targeted assistance for vulnerable populations
  - Progressive taxation policies
  - Enhanced social safety nets


Conclusion

The persistence of income inequality in the Philippines represents both a moral challenge and an economic imperative. While historical patterns paint a sobering picture, understanding these dynamics provides crucial insights for policy interventions. Success will require sustained commitment to addressing structural barriers and implementing evidence-based solutions that target the root causes of inequality rather than its symptoms.

The path forward demands a comprehensive approach that acknowledges the complexity of income inequality while maintaining focus on measurable outcomes. By addressing both historical inequities and current challenges, the Philippines can work toward creating a more inclusive economy where growth benefits all segments of society, rather than merely widening existing gaps.",1
152,Phind Instant,"The Philippines stands at a critical crossroads in its economic journey, with Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) serving as both the nation's economic lifeline and a poignant reminder of its developmental challenges. As remittances reached a record high of $36.14 billion in 2022, representing approximately 10% of the country's GDP, we must examine both the triumphs and tribulations of this crucial sector.

Economic Impact and Remittances

OFWs have earned their designation as ""Bagong-Bayani"" (modern-day heroes) through their substantial economic contributions. Their remittances serve multiple crucial functions in the Philippine economy:

•        Fueling consumer spending, which accounts for approximately 75% of economic activity
•        Providing financial stability for millions of Filipino families
•        Supporting domestic consumption during economic downturns
•        Contributing significantly to national development projects

Demographics and Distribution

The OFW workforce presents interesting demographic patterns:

•        Approximately 1.83 million Filipinos worked abroad between April and September 2021
•        Women comprise roughly 60% of the OFW population
•        Majority work in Asian countries, particularly:
•        Saudi Arabia
•        United Arab Emirates
•        Hong Kong
•        Kuwait
•        Singapore
•        Qatar
Challenges and Vulnerabilities

Behind the impressive remittance figures lies a complex tapestry of challenges faced by OFWs:

1. Workplace Safety Concerns:
•        Over 24,000 reported cases of abuse in Kuwait alone during 2022
•        Particularly concerning statistics for female workers:
        75% of reported abuse cases involve women
        Subject to the restrictive kafala system in Middle Eastern countries
        Limited legal protections in host nations

2. Social Costs:
•        Family separation and emotional distress
•        Impact on children's education and well-being
•        Complex transnational family relationships

Government Initiatives and Policy Framework

Recent government responses demonstrate evolving approaches to OFW welfare:

1. Protective Measures:
•        Deployment bans in high-risk areas
•        Enhanced diplomatic engagement with host countries
•        Strengthened support systems for returning workers


2. Policy Challenges:
•        Balancing protection with employment opportunities
•        Addressing concerns from advocacy groups about deployment bans
•        Need for sustainable long-term solutions

Economic Sustainability Concerns

The Philippines faces several structural challenges related to its labor export policy:

1. Dependence on Remittances:
•        Over-reliance on foreign employment as economic strategy
•        Limited domestic job creation
•        Vulnerability to global economic fluctuations


2. Development Implications:

161,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is a nation of contrasts. Its economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience, boasting steady GDP growth over the past decades. Major urban centers like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have become hubs for commerce, technology, and innovation. Yet, beneath these economic achievements lies a persistent and growing issue: income inequality.

The Stark Divide Between Rich and Poor

Despite progress in economic development, the wealth gap in the Philippines remains significant. According to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), income disparities are evident across regions, social classes, and employment sectors. The richest 10% of Filipinos continue to amass a disproportionate share of the country's wealth, while millions of Filipinos struggle to make ends meet.

The pandemic exacerbated this divide. The lockdowns disproportionately affected low-income workers, many of whom were employed in the informal sector without social safety nets. Meanwhile, large corporations and high-income earners were better equipped to weather the crisis, benefiting from remote work setups and digital commerce.

Root Causes of Income Inequality

Unequal Access to Education and OpportunitiesEducation remains one of the strongest indicators of economic mobility. However, quality education is not easily accessible to all Filipinos. Wealthier families can afford private schooling and international education, ensuring better job prospects for their children. In contrast, many public schools struggle with underfunding, leading to a cycle where underprivileged children have fewer opportunities to advance.

Regional Economic DisparitiesEconomic growth is often concentrated in urban areas, while rural communities—where a large portion of the population resides—lag behind. The agriculture sector, which employs millions, remains underdeveloped, with farmers earning far less than their urban counterparts. Infrastructure gaps and limited access to financial services hinder rural communities from fully participating in economic growth.

Job Market Inequality and Wage DisparitiesThe job market in the Philippines favors those with higher educational attainment and connections to established networks. While the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry has created well-paying jobs, other sectors, such as manufacturing and agriculture, remain stagnant in terms of wages. The minimum wage also varies across regions, with Metro Manila workers earning significantly more than those in the provinces.

Weak Labor Protections and Informal EmploymentA significant portion of Filipino workers are in informal employment, meaning they lack access to job security, healthcare, and retirement benefits. This sector includes street vendors, tricycle drivers, and domestic workers, who often earn below the living wage. Without formal protections, these workers remain vulnerable to economic shocks.

Political and Economic Elites’ InfluenceEconomic power in the Philippines is concentrated among a few elite families and business conglomerates. This concentration of wealth influences policymaking, often leading to laws and regulations that favor big businesses over the working class. Corruption and patronage politics further entrench economic disparities.

The Consequences of Widening Income Inequality

If left unaddressed, income inequality can lead to dire consequences for the country’s long-term stability and development. Social unrest is a potential outcome, as economic frustration fuels protests and demands for systemic change. Additionally, a significant portion of the population struggling with poverty means lower consumer spending, hindering economic expansion.

Moreover, income inequality contributes to brain drain. Skilled professionals often seek opportunities abroad due to limited career growth and lower wages in the Philippines. This loss of talent weakens industries that are crucial to national development, such as healthcare and engineering.

Bridging the Gap: Policy Recommendations

Invest in Education and Skills TrainingThe government must prioritize education reforms that enhance access to quality schooling for all, particularly in rural areas. Scholarship programs, vocational training, and digital literacy initiatives can help equip workers with skills relevant to modern industries.

Strengthen Labor Laws and Social ProtectionPolicies ensuring fair wages, job security, and benefits for informal workers are necessary. Expanding the coverage of social security and healthcare programs will provide a safety net for vulnerable populations.

Promote Inclusive Economic GrowthDeveloping rural economies through investments in infrastructure, agriculture, and digital connectivity can help bridge the gap between urban and rural incomes. Supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and encouraging entrepreneurship can also create more opportunities for upward mobility.

Enforce Progressive TaxationImplementing higher taxes on the wealthy and ensuring corporations pay their fair share can help fund social programs that benefit the poor. Proper tax collection and eliminating loopholes will be crucial in achieving this.

Combat Corruption and Strengthen GovernanceEnsuring transparency in government spending and preventing corruption can redirect resources toward essential services that help reduce inequality. Strengthening institutions that uphold democratic processes will also ensure that economic policies serve the interests of the majority, not just the elite.

A Call for Collective Action

Addressing income inequality in the Philippines requires collective effort from the government, private sector, and civil society. Economic growth should not just benefit the privileged few—it must translate to better opportunities and improved living conditions for all Filipinos.

The road ahead is challenging, but with the right policies and commitment, the Philippines can move toward a more equitable society. A nation’s true progress is not measured solely by its GDP but by the well-being of its people, especially its most vulnerable citizens. It is time to take meaningful steps to bridge the wealth gap and build a more inclusive future for all.

162,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is often recognized as one of the world’s largest labor exporters, with millions of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) scattered across various countries. Their contributions to the economy are undeniable, as remittances from OFWs form a crucial pillar of national development. While their economic impact is often highlighted, the struggles and sacrifices of these workers must also be examined to create policies that protect and empower them.

The Economic Significance of OFWs

For decades, the Philippine economy has relied on the financial support of its migrant workers. In 2022, remittances from OFWs reached over $36 billion, accounting for approximately 9% of the country’s GDP. These funds provide for families back home, boosting household consumption, real estate investment, education, and small businesses.

The money sent home by OFWs supports millions of Filipino families, helping them afford better healthcare, education, and a higher standard of living. This financial flow also fuels domestic spending, creating a ripple effect that benefits various industries, from retail and construction to banking and tourism.

Additionally, OFWs alleviate domestic unemployment. With limited job opportunities and often insufficient wages in the Philippines, working abroad allows many Filipinos to earn substantially more, improving their financial well-being while also lessening pressure on the domestic labor market.

Challenges Faced by OFWs

Despite their invaluable contributions, OFWs face numerous difficulties, from exploitation to family separation. Many OFWs endure long working hours, poor living conditions, and abuse from employers. Reports of maltreatment, wage theft, and even human trafficking highlight the vulnerabilities of Filipino migrant workers, particularly those in domestic and construction sectors.

Family separation is another critical issue. Many OFWs spend years—sometimes decades—away from their loved ones. This distance can strain relationships, affect the upbringing of children, and lead to social challenges such as the so-called ""OFW phenomenon,"" where families struggle with absentee parenting and emotional disconnection.

Another significant concern is the dependency on remittances. While these funds are crucial for daily survival, they do not always translate into long-term financial stability. Many OFW families become overly reliant on remittances, failing to invest in sustainable income sources. This dependency creates a cycle where future generations also seek work abroad, perpetuating labor migration as a necessity rather than a choice.

Government Policies and Support for OFWs

Recognizing the contributions and struggles of OFWs, the Philippine government has implemented various policies to safeguard their welfare. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) oversee programs to protect and assist Filipino workers abroad. These include pre-departure orientations, legal assistance, and financial aid for repatriated OFWs.

However, despite these efforts, gaps remain in ensuring the long-term well-being of OFWs. Strengthening diplomatic ties with host countries, enforcing stricter regulations against abusive employers, and expanding reintegration programs for returning OFWs are essential steps in improving their conditions.

Reintegration and Sustainable Economic Plans

One of the most pressing challenges is ensuring that OFWs have opportunities upon their return to the Philippines. Many returning OFWs struggle with reintegration, often finding it difficult to secure stable jobs or start businesses after years of working abroad.

To address this, the government must invest in reintegration programs that provide financial literacy training, skills development, and entrepreneurial support. Encouraging OFWs to invest their earnings in sustainable ventures will help break the cycle of overseas labor migration.

Additionally, creating more local job opportunities by boosting industries such as manufacturing, agriculture, and technology will lessen the need for Filipinos to seek work abroad. Strengthening the local economy through infrastructure projects and foreign investments can provide higher wages and better working conditions, making migration a choice rather than an economic necessity.

Conclusion

OFWs play an indispensable role in sustaining the Philippine economy, yet their contributions often come at a high personal cost. While remittances fuel growth, they should not be seen as a long-term solution to economic stability. The government must prioritize policies that protect OFWs abroad and create viable opportunities at home, ensuring that Filipinos can thrive without having to leave their families behind.

A sustainable future for the Philippines means not just celebrating the sacrifices of OFWs but also crafting a nation where working abroad is an option, not a necessity. Through comprehensive policies, economic diversification, and strengthened labor protections, the country can transition towards a more self-sufficient economy—one that values both its workforce and its long-term prosperity.

163,GPT4o-mini,"Food security remains a pressing issue in the Philippines, affecting millions of Filipinos across urban and rural areas. Despite being an agricultural country, the Philippines faces persistent challenges in ensuring access to sufficient, nutritious, and affordable food. Climate change, inadequate agricultural policies, and economic disparities continue to threaten food security, making it imperative for the government and society to take urgent action.

The State of Food Security in the Philippines

The Global Hunger Index ranks the Philippines as a country with a ""serious"" level of hunger. Many Filipinos, particularly those in low-income households, struggle to afford three meals a day. Malnutrition and undernourishment remain widespread, especially among children, contributing to stunted growth and developmental issues.

Despite the country's fertile lands, food production has not kept pace with the growing population. The reliance on food imports for staples such as rice further exacerbates vulnerabilities, as global market fluctuations and supply chain disruptions can lead to price hikes and shortages.

Factors Contributing to Food Insecurity

Climate Change and Natural DisastersThe Philippines is highly vulnerable to typhoons, droughts, and other extreme weather events that disrupt agricultural production. Flooding and soil degradation decrease crop yields, making farming increasingly unpredictable and unsustainable for many rural communities.

Declining Agricultural ProductivityThe country’s agricultural sector has suffered from underinvestment, outdated farming techniques, and a lack of support for small-scale farmers. Many farmers struggle with low incomes, forcing younger generations to seek work in urban centers rather than continue farming.

Heavy Reliance on ImportsThe Philippines imports large quantities of rice, wheat, and other essential commodities. This dependence makes the country susceptible to global price changes and supply chain disruptions. Import reliance weakens domestic food production and discourages local farmers from expanding their operations.

Land Use and UrbanizationRapid urbanization and infrastructure projects have encroached on fertile farmland. As cities expand, agricultural lands shrink, reducing the available space for food production and increasing food scarcity in certain regions.

Economic Disparities and Access to FoodWhile food may be available in markets, it is often unaffordable for many low-income families. The rising cost of living, stagnant wages, and inflation contribute to food insecurity, forcing many Filipinos to rely on less nutritious but cheaper alternatives.

Strategies to Improve Food Security

Invest in Agricultural InnovationModernizing agriculture through sustainable practices, improved irrigation, and access to technology can increase productivity. Providing farmers with better seeds, fertilizers, and machinery will help boost food production.

Strengthen Local Food ProductionReducing reliance on imports by promoting local farming and agribusiness initiatives can enhance food security. Incentivizing smallholder farmers through subsidies, loans, and training programs can encourage more sustainable agricultural growth.

Enhance Disaster Preparedness and Climate ResilienceImplementing climate-smart agriculture, building resilient infrastructure, and developing early warning systems can help mitigate the effects of climate change on food production.

Promote Sustainable Land Use PoliciesBalancing urban development with agricultural preservation is crucial. Implementing zoning regulations that protect farmlands and encourage urban farming initiatives can contribute to food sustainability.

Improve Access to Nutritious FoodExpanding social welfare programs, food subsidies, and school feeding initiatives can ensure that vulnerable populations receive adequate nutrition. Encouraging community gardens and local food cooperatives can also enhance food availability at the grassroots level.

Conclusion

Food security is a fundamental issue that requires urgent and sustained action. While the Philippines faces significant challenges, strategic investments in agriculture, climate resilience, and economic policies can help build a more secure and self-sufficient food system. A future where every Filipino has access to nutritious and affordable food is not just an ideal—it is a necessity for national development and stability.

164,GPT4o-mini,"The rapid advancement of technology has transformed societies worldwide, improving communication, education, and economic growth. In the Philippines, technology plays a crucial role in daily life, from enabling remote work to enhancing digital banking and e-commerce. However, despite these advancements, a significant portion of the population still faces barriers to accessing technology.

The Digital Divide in the Philippines

While major cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao boast high-speed internet and widespread smartphone usage, many rural areas lag behind due to poor infrastructure and high costs. The disparity in digital access creates a gap between those who can take advantage of technology and those who are left behind, reinforcing socio-economic inequalities.

A key indicator of this divide is internet accessibility. The Philippines has one of the most expensive yet slowest internet connections in Southeast Asia. High costs and unreliable service make it difficult for students, small business owners, and remote workers in underserved areas to fully participate in the digital economy.

Barriers to Technology Access

Limited Infrastructure DevelopmentMany remote and rural areas suffer from poor telecommunications infrastructure, making it difficult to provide stable internet and mobile connectivity. The lack of cell towers and fiber-optic networks hinders digital inclusion.

High Cost of Devices and Internet ServicesSmartphones, laptops, and internet plans remain unaffordable for many low-income families. Without subsidies or budget-friendly options, a large segment of the population is unable to afford essential digital tools.

Digital Literacy and Education GapsMany Filipinos, particularly older individuals and those in underprivileged communities, lack digital literacy skills. Without proper training in using technology effectively, access alone is not enough to bridge the digital divide.

Urban-Rural DisparitiesThe concentration of technology investments in urban centers leaves rural communities struggling to keep up. This affects local businesses, schools, and government services that rely on digital solutions for efficiency.

Cybersecurity and Privacy ConcernsWith increased digital activity comes the risk of cyber threats. Many Filipinos are unaware of online safety measures, making them vulnerable to scams, data breaches, and misinformation.

The Role of the Government and Private Sector

To address these challenges, both the government and private sector must work together to implement solutions that promote equitable technology access. Some key steps include:

Expanding Infrastructure InvestmentsThe government must push for nationwide broadband expansion projects, particularly in remote areas. Encouraging public-private partnerships can accelerate connectivity improvements.

Affordable Internet and Device ProgramsSubsidizing internet costs for low-income families and promoting local manufacturing of affordable digital devices can help lower barriers to entry.

Enhancing Digital Literacy ProgramsSchools, NGOs, and private firms should collaborate to provide digital skills training, ensuring that more Filipinos can safely and effectively navigate online spaces.

Promoting E-Government and Online ServicesStreamlining government services through digital platforms can make public transactions more efficient while encouraging wider adoption of technology in daily life.

Strengthening Cybersecurity MeasuresRaising awareness about digital safety, enforcing stricter online security policies, and providing resources to combat cybercrimes will protect users from potential threats.

Conclusion

The accessibility of technology in the Philippines is a defining factor in the nation’s growth and global competitiveness.

165,GPT4o-mini,"The youth of the Philippines have always played a crucial role in shaping the nation’s political landscape. As the country’s largest demographic group, young Filipinos have the numbers, the voice, and the influence to drive significant change. With advancements in technology, increased access to information, and a growing sense of civic responsibility, today’s youth are more engaged than ever in political discourse and activism.

The Growing Political Awareness Among Youth

The rise of social media has given young Filipinos an unprecedented platform to express their political views, organize movements, and hold leaders accountable. Unlike previous generations, today's youth are more informed and critical of policies that affect their future. This awareness has led to increased voter participation, advocacy for social justice, and a push for transparency and good governance.

The 2022 national elections saw a historic surge in youth voter turnout, demonstrating their collective power in influencing political outcomes. Youth-led organizations, campus debates, and digital campaigns played a significant role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing voters.

Challenges Facing Youth Participation in Politics

Despite their growing influence, young Filipinos face several challenges in their quest to shape Philippine politics:

Political DisenfranchisementMany young Filipinos still feel disconnected from the political system, believing that their voices do not matter. Traditional political structures often exclude youth participation, making it difficult for them to have a direct impact on decision-making.

Misinformation and Political ManipulationThe spread of fake news and propaganda on social media has made it challenging for young voters to distinguish fact from fiction. Political groups often exploit digital platforms to sway public opinion, sometimes leading to polarization and misinformation.

Economic Barriers to Political EngagementMany young Filipinos, especially those from marginalized communities, struggle with economic hardships that limit their ability to engage in political activities. For some, survival takes precedence over civic engagement, reducing opportunities for political participation.

Limited Representation in LeadershipWhile youth are active in advocacy and grassroots movements, their representation in formal political institutions remains low. Traditional political dynasties and established elites continue to dominate leadership positions, making it difficult for young leaders to rise through the ranks.

How Youth Can Shape Philippine Politics

Maximizing the Power of the VoteVoting is one of the most direct ways for young Filipinos to influence governance. Encouraging voter registration, political education, and participation in elections ensures that youth voices are represented in policymaking.

Engaging in Grassroots ActivismCommunity-based initiatives, student organizations, and advocacy groups provide young people with avenues to champion social and political causes. By addressing local issues and organizing campaigns, youth can push for meaningful change from the ground up.

Leveraging Digital Platforms for AwarenessSocial media remains a powerful tool for political engagement. Fact-checking, promoting civic discussions, and countering misinformation can help create an informed electorate and foster a culture of accountability among public officials.

Running for Public OfficeMore young Filipinos should consider pursuing leadership roles in government. From student councils to local governance, gaining experience in public service can pave the way for greater youth representation in politics.

Holding Leaders AccountableYouth activism should not end after elections. Monitoring government actions, joining consultations, and participating in policymaking processes ensure that leaders remain accountable to the people they serve.

Conclusion

The youth of the Philippines are not just the future—they are the present. Their involvement in politics is essential in shaping a nation that values democracy, good governance, and social justice. While challenges remain, young Filipinos must continue to assert their rights, use their voices, and take action in building a more inclusive and progressive political landscape. The power to change the Philippines lies in their hands, and with determination and unity, they can drive the country toward a brighter future.

166,GPT4o-mini,"The debate over federalism in the Philippines has been ongoing for decades, gaining momentum in recent years as various political leaders advocate for a shift from a unitary to a federal system of government. Proponents argue that federalism would bring governance closer to the people, allowing regions more autonomy and control over their resources. However, critics warn of the risks, including increased regional disparities, political dynasties, and potential instability. As the nation continues to grapple with this contentious issue, it is essential to examine the potential benefits, risks, and viability of federalism in the Philippine context.

Understanding Federalism

Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and regional governments. In a federal setup, local governments have more control over their economic policies, infrastructure projects, and governance, rather than relying heavily on directives from the national government.

Currently, the Philippines operates under a unitary system, where most powers and resources are centralized in the national government based in Manila. Shifting to a federal system would mean granting greater autonomy to regions, allowing them to have their own policies on taxation, law enforcement, and governance.

Arguments in Favor of Federalism

Decentralization and Regional EmpowermentOne of the strongest arguments for federalism is that it would reduce the overconcentration of power in Manila and distribute authority to regional governments. This would allow local leaders to craft policies tailored to the needs of their specific communities.

Economic DevelopmentProponents believe that federalism would lead to more balanced economic growth, as regions would have more control over their revenues. Instead of waiting for allocations from the national budget, regions could manage their own resources and invest in local development projects.

Improved Public ServicesWith regional governments having greater control over budgets and decision-making, public services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure could be better managed and tailored to local needs.

Reduced Bureaucracy and Faster Decision-MakingUnder a federal system, governance would be more localized, reducing the bureaucratic red tape that often slows down development projects and public service delivery in a centralized system.

Concerns and Challenges of Federalism

Risk of Widening Economic DisparitiesSome regions in the Philippines, such as Metro Manila and Cebu, are more economically developed than others. Critics argue that poorer regions might struggle without sufficient national support, further widening economic disparities.

Political Dynasties and CorruptionDecentralization could empower political dynasties that already dominate local politics, making it harder to implement transparency and good governance. With more resources and autonomy, some fear that federalism could lead to increased corruption at the regional level.

Complexity and Cost of TransitionShifting from a unitary to a federal system would require constitutional amendments, restructuring of government institutions, and the creation of new regional governments. This transition could be costly and disruptive.

National Unity and StabilitySome critics worry that giving too much autonomy to regions could foster separatist movements, particularly in areas with strong ethnic or cultural identities. Ensuring national unity while granting regional autonomy is a delicate balance that must be carefully managed.

Viability of Federalism in the Philippines

For federalism to work in the Philippines, comprehensive planning and safeguards must be in place. Key factors to consider include:

Equalization mechanisms to ensure that less-developed regions receive adequate funding and support.

Strict anti-corruption policies to prevent local leaders from misusing newfound autonomy.

Clear delineation of powers between the national and regional governments to avoid conflicts.

Gradual implementation to allow a smooth transition and adaptation to the new system.

Conclusion

The idea of federalism presents both opportunities and challenges for the Philippines. While decentralization could empower regions and promote economic growth, it also carries risks that must not be overlooked. A well-structured federal system with strong institutions and safeguards could benefit the country, but hasty implementation without addressing key concerns could lead to further political and economic instability.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt federalism should be guided by thorough studies, expert consultations, and the voices of the Filipino people. It is a bold step that requires careful planning, ensuring that the shift would serve the greater good rather than merely redistributing power among the political elite.",1
167,GPT4o-mini,"The integrity of a democracy hinges on the transparency and fairness of its electoral process. In the Philippines, election campaign financing has long been a contentious issue, with concerns about unchecked spending, opaque donation sources, and the influence of political elites shaping election outcomes. While campaign finance laws exist, gaps in enforcement and loopholes continue to undermine the credibility of elections. Strengthening financial transparency is crucial in ensuring that elections remain free, fair, and representative of the people’s will.

The Current State of Election Campaign Financing

Election campaigns in the Philippines require substantial funding. Candidates spend millions on advertisements, rallies, transportation, and other logistical needs. While the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) mandates campaign finance reports, many candidates and parties fail to fully disclose their expenses and funding sources, leading to widespread speculation about illicit contributions.

One of the biggest concerns is the role of business interests and political dynasties in campaign financing. Wealthy individuals and corporations often fund political campaigns in exchange for policy favors once a candidate wins office. This practice perpetuates a cycle where the interests of the elite overshadow the needs of ordinary citizens.

Challenges in Ensuring Financial Transparency

Lack of Proper EnforcementWhile campaign finance laws exist, their implementation remains weak. COMELEC lacks the necessary resources to thoroughly audit campaign finance reports and penalize violations effectively. Many candidates circumvent regulations by underreporting expenses or funneling funds through third parties.

Opaque Donation SourcesPolitical contributions from businesses, foreign entities, and interest groups are often hidden through intermediaries. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the undue influence of donors on government policies and decision-making.

Vote-Buying and Patronage PoliticsVote-buying remains rampant in many parts of the country. Candidates allocate large portions of their campaign funds to direct cash handouts, gifts, or incentives in exchange for votes. This undermines the democratic process and skews election results in favor of those with deeper pockets.

Unregulated Online Campaign SpendingWith the rise of digital campaigns, candidates increasingly rely on social media advertising and online influence operations. The lack of clear regulations on digital campaign spending makes it difficult to track where the money comes from and how it is used.

Strategies to Improve Election Campaign Financial Transparency

Strengthening Campaign Finance LawsStricter legislation should be passed to close loopholes that allow for unregulated campaign donations and expenditures. Laws should require detailed disclosure of all contributions and expenditures, with penalties for non-compliance.

Enhancing COMELEC’s Oversight and CapacityCOMELEC should be given more resources and authority to monitor and audit campaign finances. Establishing an independent auditing body dedicated to election finance oversight can further ensure compliance.

Implementing Real-Time Disclosure of Campaign FundsCandidates and parties should be required to disclose campaign donations and expenditures in real time through a publicly accessible online platform. This will allow voters to assess financial influences in elections more transparently.

Regulating Online Campaign SpendingThe government should implement policies that require political ads on social media to disclose their funding sources. Social media platforms should also be mandated to maintain transparency reports on political advertisements.

Cracking Down on Vote-BuyingStronger measures, including stricter penalties and community education campaigns, should be implemented to combat vote-buying. Citizens should be encouraged to report cases of vote-buying through anonymous tip lines and secure reporting platforms.

Conclusion

Ensuring financial transparency in election campaigns is essential for protecting the integrity of the Philippine democratic process. Without proper regulations and enforcement, elections risk being dominated by moneyed interests rather than the genuine will of the people. By strengthening campaign finance laws, empowering oversight bodies, and leveraging technology for transparency, the Philippines can take meaningful steps toward a more accountable and democratic electoral system.",1
168,GPT4o-mini,"Mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, yet in the Philippines, it remains a largely misunderstood and stigmatized issue. Despite increasing awareness, deep-rooted cultural beliefs, limited mental health services, and social misconceptions continue to prevent many Filipinos from seeking help. Addressing mental health stigma is crucial in fostering a society that supports individuals struggling with mental illnesses and promotes mental well-being for all.

The Reality of Mental Health Stigma in the Philippines

Mental health conditions affect millions of Filipinos, yet discussing these issues is often met with skepticism or dismissal. Many people still associate mental illnesses with weakness, laziness, or even spiritual affliction. As a result, individuals experiencing depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia often suffer in silence, fearing discrimination from their families, workplaces, and communities.

While legislative progress has been made—such as the passage of the Mental Health Act in 2018—many barriers to mental healthcare remain. Limited access to professional help, financial constraints, and a shortage of mental health professionals contribute to the ongoing crisis.

Factors Contributing to Mental Health Stigma

Cultural and Religious BeliefsIn Filipino culture, resilience and strong family ties are highly valued. Mental illness is often perceived as a sign of weakness, and individuals struggling with mental health issues may be told to simply “pray harder” or “snap out of it.” While faith and spirituality can be sources of comfort, they should not replace professional intervention when needed.

Lack of Awareness and EducationMisinformation about mental health conditions is widespread. Many Filipinos still believe that mental illness is a result of supernatural forces or personal failure. Without proper education, misconceptions continue to thrive, reinforcing negative stereotypes.

Fear of Social JudgmentThose who openly discuss their struggles with mental health often face discrimination. In the workplace, employees fear being labeled as unstable or incapable, potentially risking their careers. In families, individuals may be dismissed or ridiculed instead of being given the support they need.

Limited Access to Mental Health ServicesWhile the Mental Health Act aims to improve accessibility to mental healthcare, services remain insufficient, especially in rural areas. Many public hospitals lack the necessary resources, and private therapy is often too expensive for the average Filipino.

Media Representation and StereotypesPopular culture often portrays individuals with mental illness as violent or dangerous, reinforcing negative biases. Films, television shows, and news reports sometimes sensationalize mental health crises rather than promote understanding and empathy.

The Consequences of Stigma

The stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines has severe consequences. Individuals who fear judgment often avoid seeking treatment, leading to worsening conditions. This can result in higher rates of self-harm and suicide, particularly among young people who feel isolated and unsupported.

Furthermore, untreated mental health issues can affect productivity, relationships, and overall quality of life. When individuals do not receive proper care, the burden extends to families, workplaces, and communities, creating a ripple effect that impacts society as a whole.

Steps Toward Breaking the Stigma

Promoting Mental Health EducationSchools, workplaces, and community organizations should incorporate mental health education to debunk myths and encourage open conversations. Teaching young people about emotional well-being can help normalize discussions about mental health from an early age.

Expanding Access to Mental Health ServicesThe government must continue investing in mental health infrastructure, including hiring more professionals, improving facilities, and making services more affordable. Teletherapy and digital mental health platforms can also help bridge the gap for those in remote areas.

Encouraging Supportive ConversationsFamilies and friends play a crucial role in supporting individuals struggling with mental health. By fostering a culture of understanding and empathy, loved ones can create safe spaces where people feel comfortable seeking help.

Strengthening Workplace Mental Health PoliciesCompanies should implement mental health programs that provide employees with resources, support systems, and accommodations when needed. Recognizing mental health as part of overall employee well-being can lead to a more productive and compassionate work environment.

Using Media as a Tool for ChangeResponsible storytelling in television, film, and news can help change public perception. By portraying mental health struggles with accuracy and sensitivity, the media can play a significant role in breaking down stereotypes.

Conclusion

The stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines remains a significant barrier to progress, but change is possible through collective effort. By fostering education, improving healthcare access, and normalizing conversations about mental well-being, Filipinos can move toward a society where seeking help is not a sign of weakness but a step toward healing.

Breaking the stigma requires both institutional reforms and cultural shifts. It is time to prioritize mental health as an integral part of national development and individual well-being. After all, a mentally healthy nation is a stronger, more resilient one.

169,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is facing a growing crisis in urban congestion and housing shortages. As cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao continue to expand, the influx of people searching for better economic opportunities has placed immense pressure on urban infrastructure, transportation, and housing availability. This rapid urbanization has led to overcrowding, traffic gridlock, and an increasing number of informal settlements. Without decisive action, these issues will continue to hinder economic growth and the quality of life for millions of Filipinos.

The Reality of Urban Congestion

Metro Manila, the country’s capital region, is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. With over 13 million residents crammed into a limited space, daily life is characterized by hours-long traffic jams, overburdened public transportation, and high pollution levels. The economic cost of congestion is staggering, with estimates suggesting that the country loses billions of pesos annually due to lost productivity and increased fuel consumption.

Public transport systems, including jeepneys, buses, and trains, struggle to accommodate the daily commuter influx. While efforts have been made to expand infrastructure, such as the MRT and LRT extensions, these projects have yet to significantly alleviate congestion. Limited road networks and the prioritization of private vehicles over mass transit have further compounded the problem.

Housing Shortages and Informal Settlements

The housing shortage in the Philippines is another pressing issue linked to urban congestion. The backlog of housing units has been estimated at over 6 million, with demand increasing yearly. Many low-income families cannot afford decent housing, leading to the proliferation of informal settlements, or ""squatter areas,"" in cities. These communities lack access to clean water, sanitation, and electricity, exacerbating poverty and public health risks.

Skyrocketing property prices also contribute to the problem. Real estate in prime urban areas remains unaffordable for the average worker, forcing many to live in overcrowded rental spaces or commute from distant provinces, adding to the congestion problem. Meanwhile, government housing programs have struggled to keep up with demand, often falling short in providing sustainable, affordable housing solutions.

Causes of the Crisis

Uncontrolled Urban MigrationRural-to-urban migration continues to drive population growth in major cities. Limited economic opportunities in the provinces push many Filipinos to relocate, exacerbating housing and transport issues.

Lack of Comprehensive Urban PlanningPoor urban planning and inconsistent zoning regulations have contributed to chaotic city layouts, inefficient land use, and a lack of sustainable infrastructure.

High Land and Housing CostsReal estate developers often prioritize high-end condominiums and commercial buildings, making affordable housing a low priority. Government policies on land use and housing development need urgent reforms to address this imbalance.

Inadequate Public Transport SystemsThe focus on road expansions instead of efficient mass transit solutions has led to car-dependent urban centers, worsening congestion and pollution.

Weak Implementation of Housing ProgramsWhile the government has initiated housing projects, delays, corruption, and lack of funding have hampered their effectiveness. Many projects fail to reach those who need them the most.

Possible Solutions

Invest in Mass Transit and Smart Urban PlanningExpanding and modernizing public transportation, such as metro rail systems, bus rapid transit, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, can help decongest cities. Implementing smart city planning and decentralizing economic hubs can also encourage balanced regional development.

Affordable Housing DevelopmentThe government should incentivize developers to build low-cost housing through subsidies and tax incentives. Mixed-income housing projects can help integrate different social classes and promote inclusive urban growth.

Decentralization of Economic CentersEncouraging business growth in secondary cities and provinces can reduce migration pressure on Metro Manila. Improving rural infrastructure, such as roads and internet connectivity, can help create jobs outside major urban areas.

Strengthening Housing Policies and RegulationsImplementing stricter zoning laws and enforcing policies that prevent speculative real estate pricing can help stabilize housing costs. Land reform and efficient titling processes can also increase housing supply.

Sustainable and Inclusive Community DevelopmentSlum upgrading programs, community-led housing initiatives, and improved access to basic services can help integrate informal settlers into the formal housing market. Public-private partnerships can also be leveraged for more innovative housing solutions.

Conclusion

Urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines require urgent and coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and civil society. Sustainable urban planning, mass transit expansion, and affordable housing development are critical to making cities more livable and inclusive. The future of the Philippines depends on proactive policies that balance economic growth with social equity, ensuring that every Filipino has access to decent housing and a better quality of life.",1
170,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines, an archipelagic nation known for its stunning beaches and rich marine biodiversity, is facing a crisis that threatens its environment, public health, and economic well-being: plastic pollution. As one of the world's top contributors to ocean plastic waste, the country is grappling with an overwhelming volume of discarded plastic that clogs waterways, suffocates marine life, and infiltrates the food chain. Despite various efforts to curb this issue, plastic pollution remains a persistent and growing problem. It is time for immediate, collective action to address the root causes of this crisis before irreparable damage is done.

The Magnitude of the Problem

According to a 2021 study by the environmental advocacy group Ocean Conservancy, the Philippines contributes approximately 36% of the world’s plastic waste that enters the ocean. This staggering figure is largely attributed to the country's inefficient waste management system, high plastic consumption, and a reliance on single-use plastics. With over 7,000 islands and an extensive coastline, the Philippines is particularly vulnerable to the consequences of marine plastic pollution.

One major culprit is the sachet culture, wherein small, single-use plastic packaging is widely used for household products such as shampoo, coffee, and condiments. These sachets, often marketed as affordable options for low-income consumers, are nearly impossible to recycle, resulting in massive waste accumulation. Additionally, inadequate waste disposal infrastructure, especially in urban areas, has led to garbage piling up in waterways, further exacerbating the pollution problem.

Environmental and Societal Consequences

The impact of plastic pollution on the Philippines' environment is catastrophic. Marine biodiversity suffers greatly, as marine animals mistakenly ingest plastic debris, leading to starvation, poisoning, and death. Coral reefs, which are vital ecosystems for fish and marine organisms, are also smothered by plastic waste, hindering their growth and ability to support marine life.

Beyond environmental degradation, plastic pollution affects human communities in profound ways. Coastal towns and fishing villages bear the brunt of the crisis, as plastic-ridden waters drive away fish populations, threatening the livelihoods of millions who depend on fishing as a primary source of income. Furthermore, plastic waste contributes to flooding in urban centers like Metro Manila, where clogged drainage systems exacerbate typhoon-related disasters. This results in significant economic losses, displacement, and health risks from waterborne diseases.

Microplastics, tiny plastic particles that result from the breakdown of larger plastic debris, have infiltrated the food chain. Studies have shown that seafood, salt, and even drinking water contain microplastics, raising concerns about long-term health implications, including hormone disruption and potential carcinogenic effects.

Government and Industry Response

Recognizing the urgency of the problem, the Philippine government has taken steps to mitigate plastic pollution. In March 2022, the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Act was signed into law, requiring large enterprises to take responsibility for the plastic waste they produce. The law mandates these corporations to establish recovery and recycling programs, reducing their overall plastic footprint.

Local governments have also implemented ordinances banning or limiting single-use plastics. Cities like Quezon City and San Fernando, Pampanga, have introduced policies to curb plastic bag usage, promote reusable alternatives, and encourage waste segregation. However, enforcement remains inconsistent, and many communities still struggle with improper waste disposal due to limited resources and infrastructure.

On the industry side, some businesses have pledged to reduce their plastic use, with initiatives such as biodegradable packaging, refilling stations, and reusable container programs gaining traction. Fast-moving consumer goods companies, which have long relied on sachet packaging, are being pressured by environmental groups and consumers to transition toward sustainable alternatives.

The Role of Communities and Individuals

While government policies and corporate responsibility are crucial, individual actions and community initiatives also play a vital role in tackling plastic pollution. Grassroots movements, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local advocates have been instrumental in cleanup drives, educational campaigns, and sustainable waste management programs.

Organizations like the Plastic-Free Philippines Movement and Save Philippine Seas work tirelessly to promote plastic alternatives and hold companies accountable for their waste. Community-led programs, such as eco-brick projects—where plastic waste is repurposed into construction materials—offer innovative solutions for reducing waste and repurposing discarded plastic.

Consumers can also contribute by making conscious choices: using reusable bags, bottles, and containers, supporting brands with sustainable practices, and actively participating in local recycling programs. Public awareness and behavioral change are essential in shifting away from a disposable culture toward a more environmentally responsible society.

A Call to Action

Plastic pollution in the Philippines is not an insurmountable problem, but it requires a unified effort from the government, industries, communities, and individuals to implement lasting solutions. Strengthening waste management infrastructure, enforcing stricter regulations on plastic production and disposal, and investing in sustainable packaging alternatives must be prioritized.

Moreover, corporate accountability should go beyond compliance with laws—companies must actively innovate and transition to eco-friendly materials. The government must also support policies that incentivize businesses and consumers to adopt sustainable practices. Education and community engagement will remain critical in fostering a culture that values environmental responsibility over convenience.

As the Philippines faces mounting challenges from climate change and environmental degradation, addressing plastic pollution should be at the forefront of national priorities. Protecting the country’s natural beauty and biodiversity is not just an ecological concern—it is a socioeconomic imperative. The time to act is now, before the plastic tide overwhelms the nation’s shores and future generations inherit an ocean of waste instead of a thriving marine paradise.",1
171,Llama3.2,"The Elephant in the Room: Confronting the Philippines' Growing Income Inequality

As the Philippines celebrates its economic growth and progress, a pressing concern is being swept under the rug – income inequality. The country's GDP has been steadily increasing over the past decade, but behind the numbers lies a stark reality: one-third of the population lives below the poverty line, while the wealthiest 10% control over half of the nation's wealth.

Income inequality in the Philippines is not just a moral issue; it's an economic ticking time bomb. The widening gap between the rich and the poor has severe consequences on social cohesion, human development, and overall economic performance. It's time for policymakers to acknowledge this elephant in the room and take concrete steps to address this pressing issue.

The Roots of Inequality

Income inequality in the Philippines is rooted in its colonial past, when the wealthy elite controlled the means of production and exploited the labor force. The country's current economic policies have only exacerbated this problem. The neoliberal agenda that dominated the economy from the 1980s to the 2010s prioritized export-led growth over social welfare, leading to a concentration of wealth among a few.

The Philippine government's reliance on remittances from overseas workers has also contributed to inequality. While remittances are essential for the country's economy, they create an uneven playing field, where those who have left the country often bring back higher-paying jobs and investments, while those who remain are left behind.

Consequences of Inequality

The consequences of income inequality in the Philippines are far-reaching:

Poverty: The poor face significant challenges in accessing basic services like healthcare, education, and sanitation.
Social Unrest: The widening gap between the rich and the poor has led to increased social unrest, as marginalized communities demand their share of the country's wealth.
Economic Stagnation: Inequality hampers economic growth by stifling innovation, reducing consumer spending, and discouraging investment in education and human capital.
Brain Drain: The Philippines loses talented individuals to other countries due to limited job opportunities and low wages.
Policy Responses

To address income inequality, policymakers must adopt a multi-faceted approach:

Progressive Taxation: Implement a more progressive tax system that targets the wealthy and large corporations, ensuring they contribute their fair share to the country's social welfare.
Invest in Human Capital: Invest in education and training programs that equip workers with skills relevant to the modern economy, enabling them to compete for better-paying jobs.
Social Protection Programs: Expand social protection programs like conditional cash transfers, healthcare, and unemployment benefits to support vulnerable populations.
Regulatory Reforms: Strengthen labor laws and regulations to protect workers' rights, prevent exploitation, and ensure fair compensation.
Challenges Ahead

Implementing policies that address income inequality will not be easy. The Philippines faces significant challenges:

Limited Fiscal Space: With a relatively small tax base, the government struggles to fund social programs and policies.
Corruption: Corruption is rampant in the country, undermining trust in institutions and hindering effective governance.
Lack of Political Will: Policy-makers often prioritize short-term gains over long-term solutions.
Conclusion

Income inequality is a ticking time bomb that threatens the very fabric of Philippine society. To address this pressing issue, policymakers must take bold action to redistribute wealth, invest in human capital, and regulate the economy to ensure fair competition. It's time for leaders to put people over profits and prioritize social welfare above economic growth.

The Philippines has made significant progress in recent years, but it cannot afford to ignore the elephant in the room – income inequality. By acknowledging this issue and working together to address it, we can build a more inclusive, equitable, and prosperous society for all Filipinos.",1
172,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is one of the largest remittance-receiving countries in the world, with Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) playing a vital role in keeping the economy afloat. Every year, millions of Filipinos leave their homeland to work abroad, sending billions of dollars back home to support their families and communities. But the OFW phenomenon is more than just a numbers game; it's a reflection of our economic reality, social fabric, and national identity.

The Rise of OFWs

In the 1980s, remittances from Filipino workers overseas started to gain attention as a significant contributor to the country's economy. The Philippine Statistics Authority reported that in 2019, remittances reached PHP 338 billion (approximately USD 6.5 billion), accounting for about 10% of the country's GDP. Today, remittances are considered one of the country's main foreign exchange earners.

The number of OFWs has grown exponentially over the years, with estimates suggesting that there are around 10 million Filipinos working overseas. The majority of these workers are migrant domestic workers, followed by those in industries such as manufacturing, construction, and healthcare. Many are also entrepreneurs or small business owners, contributing to the country's entrepreneurial spirit.

The Economic Impact

OFWs have a profound impact on the Philippines' economy:

Foreign Exchange Earnings: Remittances provide a vital source of foreign exchange earnings, helping to stabilize the currency and support imports.
Job Creation: OFWs create jobs for thousands of family members in industries such as agriculture, small-scale enterprises, and services.
Social Protection: Remittances help fund social programs, including poverty alleviation initiatives, education, and healthcare.
However, the OFW phenomenon is not without its challenges:

Brain Drain: The loss of skilled workers to other countries hampers the country's ability to innovate and develop new industries.
Exploitation: Many OFWs face exploitation and abuse while abroad, including poor working conditions, low wages, and limited access to social services.
Remittance Dependence: The country's economy is heavily reliant on remittances from abroad, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy.
Policy Responses

To address these challenges, policymakers must take a multi-faceted approach:

Promote Sustainable Migration: Encourage sustainable migration practices that prioritize workers' welfare and rights.
Enhance Remittance Services: Develop more efficient remittance systems to reduce transaction costs and increase access to financial services for OFWs.
Invest in Human Capital: Invest in education, training, and skills development programs to equip Filipinos with the skills needed to compete in the global market.
Social and Cultural Significance

The OFW phenomenon is not just an economic issue; it's also a reflection of our social fabric and national identity:

Family Ties: Remittances often fund family businesses, support children's education, and help maintain community ties.
Cultural Exchange: The OFW experience fosters cultural exchange between the Philippines and host countries, promoting mutual understanding and respect.
National Pride: The success of Filipinos working abroad is a source of national pride, demonstrating our people's resilience and determination.
Conclusion

The Philippines' OFWs are the backbone of our economy, sending billions of dollars back home to support their families and communities. To harness the potential of remittances and promote sustainable migration practices, policymakers must take bold action. By investing in human capital, enhancing remittance services, and promoting cultural exchange, we can build a more prosperous and inclusive society for all Filipinos.

The OFW phenomenon is a reflection of our country's complexities, contradictions, and strengths. It highlights the resilience and determination of our people, as well as our economic challenges and opportunities. As we move forward, it's essential to recognize the importance of OFWs in shaping our national identity and economy.",1
173,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is one of the most food-secure countries in Southeast Asia, but beneath the surface lies a complex web of challenges that threaten our ability to produce and provide for our nation's growing population. The country's food security situation has been shaped by decades of agricultural development, climate change, and social and economic factors. To ensure that every Filipino has access to nutritious and sufficient food, we must confront these issues head-on.

The Food Security Conundrum

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country's food availability index has increased significantly over the past decade, with an average of 2,800 calories per person per day. However, this progress is threatened by several factors:

What is Federalism?

Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. This allows for greater autonomy and flexibility at the local level, while also providing a framework for national unity and cooperation.

Why Federalism Now?

The Philippines has many compelling reasons to consider federalism:

Regional Disparities: The country is home to vast regional disparities in economic development, infrastructure, and access to services. Federalism could provide a more effective way of addressing these disparities by giving regions greater autonomy.
Municipal Governance: Municipal governments are often overwhelmed by the tasks of providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Federalism could provide a more efficient way of delivering services at the local level.
National Unity: Federalism could help to promote national unity by giving regions a greater sense of ownership and participation in national decision-making.
Benefits of Federalism

Federalism has many benefits for the Philippines:

Increased Autonomy: Regions would have greater autonomy to make decisions about their own affairs, allowing them to tailor policies to their specific needs.
Improved Delivery of Services: Federalism could lead to more efficient delivery of services at the local level, reducing bureaucracy and increasing access to essential services.
Economic Growth: Federalism could help to promote economic growth by giving regions greater control over their own economic development strategies.
Challenges and Concerns

However, there are also many challenges and concerns associated with federalism:

Institutional Framework: The institutional framework for a federal system would need to be established, including the creation of new institutions such as regional governments and assemblies.
Power Dynamics: There is a risk that power dynamics could shift in favor of regions with greater economic or military strength, potentially leading to fragmentation and instability.
Financial Challenges: The financial implications of federalism would need to be carefully considered, including the potential for increased costs and decreased revenue.
A Path Forward

So what can be done to make federalism a reality in the Philippines?

Constitutional Reform: A constitutional reform process could begin by exploring the possibility of federalism and its implications for the country.
Regional Autonomy: Regions would need to demonstrate their ability to govern themselves effectively, with a focus on delivering basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
National Dialogue: A national dialogue would be necessary to ensure that all stakeholders are heard and considered in the decision-making process.
Conclusion

The Philippines has many compelling reasons to consider federalism. By giving regions greater autonomy and promoting national unity, federalism could help to unlock the country's true potential and create a more prosperous and equitable society for all.

However, there are also many challenges and concerns associated with federalism, including institutional frameworks, power dynamics, and financial implications.

Ultimately, the decision on whether to adopt federalism will depend on careful consideration of these factors, as well as a commitment to building a more inclusive and participatory democracy.",1
177,Llama3.2,"As the country prepares for another round of elections, concerns are growing about the lack of transparency in campaign finance. The practice of ""kampanaryo"" – or ""campaigning"" as it is colloquially known – has become a lucrative business, with politicians and party officials using their vast networks to solicit funds from wealthy donors.

The Problem with Kamsahanan

Kampanaryo is often associated with bribery, extortion, and other forms of corruption. The practice involves individuals offering large sums of money or favors in exchange for votes or support during elections. This system can lead to a culture of entitlement among politicians, where they believe that their power and influence are bought and paid for.

The Need for Transparency

Transparency is essential in campaign finance to ensure that the electoral process remains fair and free from corruption. Without it, voters may feel coerced into supporting candidates who have been bought off by wealthy donors.

Disclosure Requirements: Candidates and parties should be required to disclose their sources of funding and any financial transactions related to their campaigns.
Campaign Finance Regulations: Strict regulations should be implemented to prevent money laundering and ensure that campaign finance laws are enforced.
Independent Oversight: An independent agency should be established to oversee campaign finance and investigate any allegations of corruption.
The Role of the Election Commission

The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) plays a critical role in ensuring transparency in campaign finance. However, its effectiveness has been hampered by inadequate resources and a lack of political will.

Enhanced Disclosure Requirements: The COMElec should be empowered to enforce stricter disclosure requirements for candidates and parties.
Increased Resources: The agency should receive adequate funding and resources to conduct thorough investigations and enforcement actions.
Independent Oversight: The COMELEC should have the authority to investigate allegations of corruption and ensure that campaign finance laws are enforced.
Civil Society and Media

Civil society organizations and the media also play a crucial role in promoting transparency in campaign finance.

Whistleblower Protection: Whistleblowers who report instances of corruption or irregularities in campaign finance should be protected from retaliation.
Media Scrutiny: The media should scrutinize campaign finance practices and hold candidates and parties accountable for any wrongdoing.
Public Education: Public education campaigns should be launched to inform voters about the importance of transparency in campaign finance.
Conclusion

The lack of transparency in campaign finance is a major concern that threatens the integrity of our electoral process. It is essential that we take bold steps to address this issue and ensure that elections are free from corruption and coercion.

By implementing stricter disclosure requirements, increasing resources for the COMELEC, and promoting independent oversight, we can shine a light on the dark world of campaign finance and create a more transparent and accountable electoral system.",1
178,Llama3.2,"Mental health is often stigmatized and misunderstood in many cultures, including the Philippines. The stigma surrounding mental illness can lead to social isolation, decreased treatment seeking, and reduced overall well-being for individuals affected by mental health conditions.

The Prevalence of Mental Health Issues

According to a 2019 survey conducted by the National Mental Health Authority, approximately 10% of the Philippine population suffers from mental illnesses. However, due to stigma and lack of awareness, many people suffer in silence, with some even dying due to untreated conditions.

Suicide: The Philippines has one of the highest rates of suicide in Southeast Asia. In 2019 alone, over 4,000 Filipinos died by suicide.
Depression: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and the Philippines is no exception. According to a 2017 study, approximately 14 million Filipinos suffer from depression.
The Impact of Stigma

Stigma surrounding mental health issues can have severe consequences:

Social Isolation: People with mental illnesses often face social isolation due to fear of judgment or rejection by family and friends.
Delayed Treatment: Fear of stigma leads to delayed treatment seeking, resulting in worsening symptoms and reduced quality of life.
Increased Risk of Self-Harm: Social isolation and lack of support can increase the risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviors.
Breaking the Silence

179,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is often touted as one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, but beneath its gleaming skyscrapers and bustling streets lies a tangled web of urban congestion and housing shortages that are suffocating the country's most vulnerable populations.

A Perfect Storm of Development

The Philippines has been experiencing rapid economic growth over the past few decades, with many cities expanding at breakneck speed to accommodate the influx of migrants seeking better opportunities. However, this surge in development has come at a cost: urban congestion and housing shortages have become entrenched problems that are straining the country's infrastructure and exacerbating poverty.

Congestion: A Silent Killer

Urban congestion is one of the most pressing issues facing the Philippines today. The capital city, Manila, alone has over 1 million vehicles on its streets, with some estimates suggesting that traffic in Metro Manila costs commuters around PHP 20 billion (USD 400 million) per year in lost productivity.

Air Pollution: Congested cities produce massive amounts of air pollution, which not only harms human health but also exacerbates climate change.
Increased Commuting Time: The longer people spend commuting, the more time they have to earn a living, which can limit their ability to afford basic needs like housing and food.
Housing Shortages: A Crisis for the Poor

The Philippines has one of the lowest homeownership rates in Asia, with around 20% of urban households unable to afford decent housing. This is exacerbated by a severe shortage of affordable housing, particularly in Manila and other major cities.

Overcrowding: Many families are forced to live in cramped conditions, with some estimates suggesting that up to 30% of Filipino households share a single room.
Poor Living Conditions: Overcrowded and poorly ventilated homes can lead to health problems like respiratory diseases and malaria.
Breaking the Cycle

To tackle these issues, policymakers must consider innovative solutions that address both congestion and housing shortages simultaneously. Some possible strategies include:

Mixed-Use Development: Building mixed-use developments that combine residential, commercial, and recreational spaces can help reduce urban sprawl and promote more efficient land use.
Public Transportation: Investing in efficient public transportation systems can help reduce the number of vehicles on the road and alleviate congestion.
Affordable Housing: Providing affordable housing options through programs like subsidized loans or community land trusts can help address the shortage of decent housing.
Conclusion

The Philippines' urban congestion and housing shortages are complex issues that require bold, multi-faceted solutions. By prioritizing innovative approaches to development, transportation, and housing, policymakers can help create more livable cities that benefit all members of society – not just the privileged few.",1
180,Llama3.2,"The Philippines, known for its pristine beaches and vibrant coral reefs, is also grappling with one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time: plastic pollution. From the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to the country's own coastlines, the impact of plastic waste is being felt far and wide.

A Global Problem with Local Consequences

The Philippines is not immune to the global plastic pollution problem. In fact, the country's location in the Pacific Ocean makes it a critical player in the issue. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a massive accumulation of plastic debris, stretches across 1.6 million square kilometers of ocean.

Marine Life Suffer: Plastic waste harms marine life by entanglement, ingestion, and suffocation.
Human Health at Risk: Exposure to plastic pollution has been linked to various health problems, including cancer, reproductive issues, and respiratory diseases.
The Local Impact

Plastic pollution is not just a distant issue; it's a very real concern for Filipinos. The country's coastline is littered with plastic waste, from bags and bottles to microbeads and fishing nets. This not only harms the environment but also poses risks to human health.

Beach Cleanups: Regular beach cleanups have become a norm in many coastal towns, with volunteers working tirelessly to collect trash.
Economic Costs: The economic impact of plastic pollution is significant, from lost tourism revenue to increased healthcare costs.
Breaking the Cycle

To address this issue, we need a multifaceted approach that involves individuals, businesses, and government agencies. Some possible strategies include:

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR): Implementing EPR policies can encourage manufacturers to take responsibility for the waste generated by their products.
Recycling Infrastructure: Investing in recycling infrastructure can help increase the amount of plastic waste that is properly recycled.
Education and Awareness: Educating the public about the impact of plastic pollution can inspire behavior change and promote sustainable practices.
Conclusion

The Philippines' plastic pollution problem requires immediate attention. By working together, we can reduce our reliance on single-use plastics, increase recycling rates, and protect the country's environment and public health. The time to act is now.",1
181,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, a land of breathtaking landscapes and vibrant culture, is also a nation starkly divided. While a burgeoning middle class and a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals enjoy the fruits of economic growth, a significant portion of the population remains trapped in a cycle of poverty, highlighting the persistent and deeply entrenched issue of income inequality. This disparity isn't merely a statistic; it's a lived reality that shapes opportunities, access to resources, and the very fabric of Philippine society.   

The starkness of this inequality is evident in the Gini coefficient, a common measure of income distribution. While figures fluctuate depending on the source and methodology, the Philippines consistently ranks among the countries with a relatively high Gini coefficient in Southeast Asia. This translates to a situation where a small percentage of the population controls a disproportionately large share of the nation's wealth.   

Several factors contribute to this persistent inequality. One crucial element is the historical legacy of land ownership. Land reforms, while well-intentioned, have often fallen short of their goals, leaving many farmers and agricultural workers landless or with insufficient land to sustain themselves. This perpetuates a cycle of poverty in rural areas, where a significant portion of the population resides.   

Furthermore, the concentration of economic activity in urban centers, particularly Metro Manila, exacerbates the divide. While these areas offer greater opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship, they also face challenges such as high living costs, traffic congestion, and inadequate infrastructure, which disproportionately affect low-income residents. This urban-rural divide creates a situation where those in rural areas are often left behind, lacking access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential services.   

Education plays a pivotal role in addressing income inequality, but the Philippine education system faces significant challenges. Access to quality education is often determined by socioeconomic status, with wealthier families able to afford private schools and supplementary resources. Public schools, particularly in rural areas, often struggle with inadequate funding, teacher shortages, and limited resources. This disparity in educational opportunities perpetuates the cycle of poverty, as individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to acquire the skills and qualifications necessary for well-paying jobs.   

The labor market also contributes to income inequality. The prevalence of contractualization, or ""endo"" (end of contract), undermines job security and limits access to benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans. This practice disproportionately affects low-skilled workers, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation and economic instability. Furthermore, the informal economy, where many Filipinos work without formal contracts or social protection, further exacerbates the problem.   

The impact of income inequality extends beyond economic hardship. It also has significant social and political consequences. It can lead to social unrest, as marginalized communities feel increasingly alienated and disenfranchised. It can also undermine democratic institutions, as the concentration of wealth and power can lead to political influence that favors the elite.   

Addressing income inequality requires a multifaceted approach that tackles the root causes of the problem. Land reform, while challenging, remains crucial for addressing rural poverty. Investing in education and healthcare, particularly in rural areas, is essential for providing equal opportunities for all Filipinos. Strengthening labor laws and promoting job security can help protect vulnerable workers and reduce exploitation.   

Furthermore, the government needs to implement progressive taxation policies that redistribute wealth and generate revenue for social programs. Cracking down on tax evasion and corruption is also crucial for ensuring that public funds are used effectively and equitably. Promoting inclusive economic growth that benefits all segments of society, rather than just a select few, is essential for creating a more just and equitable Philippines.

Beyond government action, the private sector also has a role to play. Businesses can contribute to reducing income inequality by paying fair wages, providing decent working conditions, and investing in employee training and development. They can also support social enterprises and initiatives that create opportunities for marginalized communities.

Civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations play a vital role in advocating for the rights of the poor and marginalized. They can provide essential services, raise awareness about income inequality, and hold the government and private sector accountable.   

Ultimately, addressing income inequality requires a collective effort from all sectors of society. It requires a commitment to creating a more just and equitable Philippines, where all citizens have the opportunity to thrive. It necessitates a shift in mindset, from viewing economic growth as an end in itself to recognizing it as a means to achieve social progress and well-being for all.

182,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines has long been known as a land of opportunity, but for many Filipinos, the promise of a better life lies beyond its shores. Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) have become an integral part of the country's economic landscape, their remittances providing a lifeline for families and communities across the archipelago. However, the complex relationship between OFWs and the Philippine economy is a multifaceted one, with both significant benefits and challenges.

The Economic Impact of OFWs

OFWs are often hailed as modern-day heroes, their sacrifices contributing significantly to the Philippine economy. Remittances, the money sent back by OFWs to their families in the Philippines, have become a major source of foreign exchange, surpassing even tourism revenues in recent years. These funds are used to support basic needs such as food, education, and healthcare, and also stimulate domestic consumption and investment.

Moreover, OFWs gain valuable skills and experience abroad, which they can bring back to the Philippines upon their return. This knowledge transfer can benefit various sectors of the economy, from healthcare and education to business and technology. Additionally, OFWs often invest in businesses and real estate in the Philippines, further contributing to economic growth.

Challenges and Concerns

While the contributions of OFWs are undeniable, there are also challenges and concerns associated with their presence. The reliance on remittances can create a dependency on foreign income, potentially hindering the development of domestic industries and job creation. The brain drain, or the loss of skilled professionals to foreign countries, can also have a negative impact on the Philippine economy.

Furthermore, the welfare and protection of OFWs remain a significant concern. Many OFWs face challenges such as exploitation, abuse, and even human trafficking. The Philippine government has implemented various measures to protect the rights of OFWs, but more needs to be done to ensure their safety and well-being.

The Way Forward

To maximize the benefits of OFWs while mitigating the risks, a comprehensive and sustainable strategy is needed. This should include:

Investing in education and skills development to equip Filipinos with the skills needed to compete in the global job market.
Promoting the creation of decent jobs in the Philippines to reduce the need for Filipinos to seek employment abroad.
Strengthening the protection of OFWs' rights and welfare, both at home and abroad.
Encouraging OFWs to invest their knowledge and skills in the Philippine economy upon their return.
Diversifying the economy to reduce reliance on remittances.
By addressing these issues and implementing effective policies, the Philippines can harness the potential of its OFWs to drive sustainable economic growth and development. The OFWs, with their resilience, determination, and unwavering commitment to their families and communities, will continue to play a vital role in shaping the future of the Philippines.",1

186,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines has long been a unitary state, with power concentrated in the national government. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement for federalism, which would devolve power to regional governments. Proponents argue that federalism would bring greater autonomy, efficiency, and development to the regions, while opponents express concerns about potential instability and the fragmentation of the nation.

The Arguments for Federalism

Advocates of federalism believe that it would bring several benefits to the Philippines. They argue that it would allow regions to tailor their policies to their specific needs and circumstances, leading to more efficient and effective governance. They also contend that federalism would promote economic development in the regions, as they would have greater control over their resources and the ability to attract investment.

Furthermore, proponents argue that federalism would enhance political participation and empower local communities. They believe that it would give marginalized groups a greater voice in decision-making and promote greater social justice.

The Concerns About Federalism

Opponents of federalism raise several concerns about its potential consequences. They argue that it could lead to the fragmentation of the nation and exacerbate regional disparities. They also express concerns about the potential for conflict between the national government and regional governments, as well as the potential for corruption and inefficiency at the regional level.

Furthermore, opponents argue that federalism could undermine national unity and weaken the central government's ability to address national challenges. They also express concerns about the potential for secessionist movements and the erosion of national identity.

The Way Forward

The debate over federalism in the Philippines is complex and multifaceted. There is no easy answer, and the potential benefits and risks must be carefully weighed. It is important to have a thorough and open discussion about the potential consequences of federalism, taking into account the diverse perspectives and interests of all stakeholders.

187,Gemini1.5-flash,"In a democratic society, elections serve as the cornerstone of governance, ensuring that citizens have a voice in shaping their future. However, the integrity of the electoral process is heavily influenced by campaign financing. In the Philippines, campaign spending has long been a contentious issue, with concerns over transparency, accountability, and potential avenues for corruption. As election cycles become increasingly expensive, the call for financial transparency in political campaigns grows louder. This editorial seeks to explore the current state of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, the challenges faced in enforcing financial regulations, and the potential reforms that could strengthen democratic institutions.

The Current State of Campaign Finance in the Philippines

The Philippines has regulations in place to oversee campaign financing, primarily through the Omnibus Election Code and the Fair Elections Act. Candidates and political parties are required to disclose their sources of campaign funds, spending limits are imposed, and post-election reporting is mandated. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) serves as the primary regulatory body overseeing these financial disclosures.

Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains problematic. Many candidates and political parties either fail to submit accurate financial reports or circumvent the rules through loopholes. The lack of real-time monitoring and inadequate enforcement mechanisms have made it difficult to ensure that campaign finance laws are strictly followed.

Challenges in Ensuring Financial Transparency

Weak Enforcement and MonitoringOne of the biggest issues in campaign finance transparency is weak enforcement. COMELEC lacks the resources and manpower to conduct thorough audits of campaign finances. While financial reports are submitted, their accuracy is rarely scrutinized due to limited oversight capacity.

Undisclosed Campaign Donations and SpendingCandidates often receive campaign donations from business entities, political allies, and even foreign sources, many of which go unreported. Additionally, ""off-the-books"" spending, such as vote-buying and grassroots mobilization expenses, remains rampant and difficult to trace.

Influence of Wealthy Donors and Political DynastiesA significant portion of campaign financing in the Philippines comes from affluent individuals and business groups seeking political favor. The lack of transparency in these contributions raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest, where policies are crafted to benefit donors rather than the general public.

Social Media and Digital Advertising SpendingWith the rise of digital campaigning, social media platforms have become a battleground for political influence. However, tracking expenditures on digital ads and sponsored content remains a challenge. Many campaigns utilize third-party groups to fund online propaganda, making it difficult to account for actual spending.

Lack of Public Awareness and EngagementThe general public plays a crucial role in demanding financial transparency, yet many citizens are unaware of their right to scrutinize campaign finance records. Limited access to financial disclosures and a lack of easily digestible reports hinder public engagement on this critical issue.

Potential Reforms for Greater Transparency

To address these challenges, a multi-pronged approach involving institutional reforms, technological advancements, and public engagement is necessary. Here are some proposed solutions:

Strengthening COMELEC’s Oversight PowersIncreasing COMELEC’s budget and human resources could improve its capacity to audit campaign finance records thoroughly. Implementing harsher penalties for non-compliance, including disqualification from elections, could deter candidates from violating transparency laws.

Mandatory Real-Time Campaign Finance DisclosureA digital, publicly accessible database for campaign contributions and expenditures should be implemented. Candidates should be required to update their financial records in real-time, allowing for greater transparency and media scrutiny during the campaign period.

Regulating Third-Party Political SpendingMany political campaigns benefit from independent groups that spend heavily on advertising and voter mobilization efforts. A regulatory framework must be established to monitor these expenditures and ensure that they are properly reported.

Enhancing Digital Ad TransparencySocial media platforms should be required to disclose detailed information on political ads, including spending amounts, sources of funding, and targeted demographics. This can help curb misinformation and foreign interference in Philippine elections.

Public Education and Media InvolvementCivil society organizations and the media should play an active role in educating voters about campaign finance laws and how they can access financial records. Investigative journalism should be encouraged to expose violations and hold candidates accountable.

Conclusion

Financial transparency in election campaigns is essential to maintaining a fair and democratic electoral system. While the Philippines has made strides in regulating campaign financing, enforcement remains weak, and loopholes persist. Addressing these issues requires stronger oversight, technological innovation, and increased public participation. Without these reforms, the risk of undue influence over the electoral process remains high, ultimately undermining the democratic ideals that the Philippines aspires to uphold.",1

This pervasive societal attitude, characterized by fear, shame, and discrimination, hinders individuals from seeking help and accessing essential mental health services. As a result, countless Filipinos suffer in silence, their mental well-being compromised by the weight of societal prejudice.

The Roots of Mental Health Stigma

The roots of mental health stigma in the Philippines can be traced to a complex interplay of cultural, social, and economic factors. Traditional beliefs often attribute mental illness to supernatural causes, leading to fear and ostracization. The lack of mental health literacy and awareness further fuels misconceptions and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. Moreover, the economic constraints faced by many Filipinos limit access to quality mental health care, exacerbating the problem.

The Impact of Stigma

The impact of mental health stigma is far-reaching and devastating. It prevents individuals from seeking help, delaying treatment and exacerbating mental health conditions. The fear of being labeled as ""crazy"" or ""weak"" can lead to self-isolation, social withdrawal, and even self-harm. Moreover, stigma can create a hostile environment for individuals with mental health conditions, affecting their employment prospects, relationships, and overall quality of life.

Challenging the Stigma: A Call to Action

Addressing mental health stigma requires a multi-pronged approach involving education, advocacy, and policy change. Raising awareness about mental health issues and promoting mental health literacy can help dispel myths and misconceptions. Challenging harmful stereotypes through media campaigns and public education can create a more accepting and supportive environment for individuals with mental health conditions.

Furthermore, investing in mental health services and making them more accessible to all Filipinos is crucial. This includes expanding access to mental health professionals, increasing the availability of mental health services in rural areas, and integrating mental health care into primary healthcare services.

The Role of Technology in Combating Stigma

Online platforms can provide a safe and anonymous space for individuals to seek support, connect with others who share similar experiences, and access mental health resources. Telehealth services can expand access to mental health care, particularly in remote and underserved areas.

A Brighter Future for Mental Health in the Philippines

Overcoming mental health stigma in the Philippines requires a collective effort from individuals, families, communities, and the government. By challenging harmful stereotypes, promoting mental health literacy, and investing in accessible mental health services, we can create a more inclusive and supportive society where individuals with mental health conditions can thrive.

The journey towards a stigma-free Philippines is not without its challenges, but it is a journey worth undertaking. By breaking down the barriers of stigma, we can empower individuals to seek help, promote mental well-being, and build a healthier and more compassionate society for all.",1
189,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, a nation of vibrant cities and bustling metropolises, is facing a growing crisis: urban congestion and housing shortages. As the country experiences rapid economic growth and urbanization, the demand for housing and infrastructure has skyrocketed, leading to overcrowded cities, traffic gridlock, and a lack of affordable housing for many Filipinos.

The Roots of the Problem

Several factors contribute to the urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines. One of the primary drivers is the rapid influx of people from rural areas to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities. This has led to a significant increase in the population of major cities, straining existing infrastructure and resources.

Another contributing factor is the lack of adequate urban planning and development. Many cities in the Philippines have not been able to keep pace with the rapid growth, leading to haphazard development and a lack of essential infrastructure such as roads, public transportation, and water and sanitation systems.

Furthermore, the high cost of land and construction materials has made it difficult for many Filipinos to afford housing. This has led to a shortage of affordable housing options, particularly for low-income families.

The Impact of Urban Congestion and Housing Shortages

The consequences of urban congestion and housing shortages are far-reaching and affect all aspects of life in the Philippines. Traffic congestion leads to wasted productivity, increased pollution, and higher transportation costs. Overcrowded cities can also lead to increased crime rates and a decline in quality of life.

The lack of affordable housing has a particularly devastating impact on low-income families. Many are forced to live in overcrowded and substandard housing, which can have negative impacts on their health and well-being.

Addressing the Crisis

Addressing the challenges of urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes improving urban planning and development, investing in infrastructure, and promoting affordable housing options.

This includes creating mixed-use developments that integrate residential, commercial, and recreational spaces.

Infrastructure Development: Investing in infrastructure such as roads, public transportation, and water and sanitation systems is crucial to improving the quality of life in urban areas and reducing traffic congestion.

Affordable Housing: The government needs to promote affordable housing options through subsidies, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships. This will help ensure that all Filipinos have access to decent and affordable housing.

Conclusion

Urban congestion and housing shortages are major challenges facing the Philippines today. However, by implementing effective urban planning and development strategies, investing in infrastructure, and promoting affordable housing, the government can address these challenges and create more livable and sustainable cities for all Filipinos. The future of the Philippines depends on our ability to create cities that are not only economically prosperous but also socially and environmentally sustainable.",1
190,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, a nation of breathtaking natural beauty, is increasingly grappling with a silent crisis: plastic pollution. From pristine beaches to bustling cities, the archipelago is inundated with plastic waste, threatening marine ecosystems, endangering human health, and hindering sustainable development.

The Scope of the Problem

The Philippines is one of the world's largest contributors to marine plastic pollution. Mismanaged plastic waste, including single-use plastics, leaches into the environment, contaminating waterways, and eventually ending up in the ocean. This plastic pollution poses a significant threat to marine life, as animals often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement.

Plastic pollution also has a significant impact on human health. Microplastics, tiny fragments of plastic, have been found in the food chain, raising concerns about potential health risks. Additionally, plastic pollution can contaminate water sources and contribute to the spread of diseases.

The Roots of the Problem

Several factors contribute to the plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines. The widespread use of single-use plastics, such as plastic bags, bottles, and food packaging, is a major contributor. Inadequate waste management infrastructure, including limited recycling facilities and inefficient waste collection systems, exacerbates the problem.

Moreover, the lack of public awareness and education about the dangers of plastic pollution hinders efforts to reduce plastic consumption and promote sustainable waste management practices.

Addressing the Plastic Tide

Addressing the plastic pollution crisis requires a multi-pronged approach involving government action, industry collaboration, and public awareness campaigns.

Government Action: The government needs to implement stricter regulations on the production and use of single-use plastics, such as plastic bags and styrofoam. Investing in waste management infrastructure, including recycling facilities and waste-to-energy plants, is also crucial.

Public Awareness Campaigns: Raising public awareness about the dangers of plastic pollution and promoting sustainable consumption habits is essential. This can be achieved through educational campaigns, community outreach programs, and social media initiatives.

Conclusion

The plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines is a serious challenge that requires urgent attention. By working together, the government, private sector, and the public can take concrete steps to reduce plastic waste, protect the environment, and create a more sustainable future for the Philippines. The time to act is now. The future of the Philippines depends on our ability to confront the plastic tide and protect our precious natural resources.",1
191,Copilot,"The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, is a nation of stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. Despite the breathtaking landscapes and the vibrant mosaic of its peoples, the country grapples with a deeply ingrained issue: income inequality. This disparity in wealth distribution is not merely an economic problem but a social malady that hampers the nation's progress and the quality of life of millions of Filipinos.

The Roots of Inequality

To understand income inequality in the Philippines, one must look into the historical, socio-economic, and political factors that have shaped the nation's economic landscape. Colonial legacies, persistent poverty, and a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few elites have all contributed to the current state of affairs. The pre-colonial barangays, Spanish encomiendas, and American economic policies laid the groundwork for a society where wealth and power were heavily skewed towards a select group.

Fast forward to the present, and the economic structure has not fundamentally changed. Large conglomerates, often owned by powerful families, dominate key sectors such as real estate, manufacturing, and utilities. This concentration of economic power means that wealth is not evenly distributed, with a significant portion of the population struggling to make ends meet.

Impact on Society

The effects of income inequality are far-reaching. First and foremost, it exacerbates poverty. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, approximately 21% of Filipinos lived below the poverty line in 2018. Income inequality means that the benefits of economic growth are not shared equitably, leaving the poor with limited access to basic services such as education, healthcare, and housing.

Education, in particular, is a critical area affected by income inequality. While private schools and universities offer top-notch education, they are often beyond the reach of the average Filipino. Public schools, on the other hand, are plagued with issues such as overcrowded classrooms, lack of resources, and inadequate facilities. This educational divide perpetuates the cycle of poverty, as those who cannot afford quality education are less likely to secure well-paying jobs in the future.

Healthcare is another sector where income inequality rears its ugly head. Wealthier individuals can afford private healthcare, which offers better facilities and services. In contrast, the poor must rely on underfunded public hospitals and clinics, leading to disparities in health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted these inequalities, with access to testing, treatment, and vaccines being unequal across different socio-economic groups.

Government Policies and Challenges

Over the years, various administrations have attempted to address income inequality through different policies and programs. The implementation of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), a conditional cash transfer program, has helped provide financial assistance to the poorest households. The program aims to break the cycle of poverty by investing in health and education, but its impact has been limited by issues such as bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption.

Tax reform is another area where the government has made strides. The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, enacted in 2018, aimed to simplify the tax system and make it more equitable. While the law increased the take-home pay of many Filipinos, it also raised the prices of goods and services, disproportionately affecting the poor.

Despite these efforts, the challenge of income inequality remains daunting. Corruption, weak governance, and political dynasties hinder the effective implementation of policies aimed at reducing inequality. The concentration of power in the hands of a few elites means that policies often favor the wealthy, further entrenching the divide between the rich and the poor.

Moving Forward: Potential Solutions

Addressing income inequality in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach. First and foremost, there needs to be a focus on inclusive economic growth. This means creating an environment where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can thrive, providing more opportunities for employment and income generation. Supporting the agricultural sector, which employs a significant portion of the population, is also crucial. Investment in infrastructure, technology, and training can help farmers increase productivity and income.

Education reform is another critical area. Ensuring that every Filipino has access to quality education, regardless of their socio-economic background, is essential for breaking the cycle of poverty. This requires not only increasing funding for public schools but also addressing issues such as teacher training, curriculum development, and school facilities.

Healthcare reform is equally important. The implementation of the Universal Health Care (UHC) law in 2019 was a step in the right direction, aiming to provide all Filipinos with access to quality healthcare. However, the success of this law depends on proper funding, efficient implementation, and addressing systemic issues within the healthcare system.

Finally, addressing corruption and improving governance are essential for reducing income inequality. Transparent and accountable governance ensures that public funds are used effectively and that policies aimed at reducing inequality are implemented properly. Strengthening institutions, promoting the rule of law, and encouraging citizen participation in governance are all steps towards achieving this goal.

Conclusion

Income inequality is a complex and deeply rooted issue in the Philippines. It affects not only the economy but also the social fabric of the nation. Addressing this issue requires a holistic approach that includes inclusive economic growth, education and healthcare reform, and improved governance. While the challenge is immense, the potential rewards—a more equitable and prosperous society—make it a battle worth fighting. As Filipinos say, “Bayanihan,” or community spirit, can help the nation move forward together, leaving no one behind.",1
192,Copilot,"The Philippines has long been known for its vibrant culture, beautiful landscapes, and resilient people. Among its most significant contributors to the nation's economic stability and growth are the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). These modern-day heroes leave their homeland to work abroad, driven by the desire to provide better lives for their families and contribute to the nation's progress. This editorial explores the profound impact of OFWs on the Philippine economy, highlighting their sacrifices, contributions, and the challenges they face.

The Economic Impact of OFWs
OFWs play a crucial role in the Philippine economy through their remittances. In 2022, remittances from OFWs reached a record high of $36.14 billion, accounting for nearly 10% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)1. These funds are vital for the economic stability of the Philippines, as they fuel consumer spending, support local businesses, and contribute to community development.

Remittances are often used by families to cover essential expenses such as education, healthcare, and housing. This financial support not only improves the quality of life for the recipients but also stimulates economic activity in various sectors. For instance, increased spending on education leads to higher demand for educational services and materials, while investments in housing boost the construction industry.

The Social Impact of OFWs
Beyond their economic contributions, OFWs also have a significant social impact. Their remittances help alleviate poverty and reduce income inequality in the Philippines. By providing financial support to their families, OFWs enable their loved ones to access better opportunities and improve their living standards.

However, the social impact of OFWs is not without challenges. Many OFWs endure long periods of separation from their families, leading to emotional and psychological stress. The absence of a parent or spouse can affect family dynamics and the well-being of children. Despite these challenges, the resilience and dedication of OFWs remain unwavering, as they continue to fulfill their responsibilities both abroad and at home.

Challenges Faced by OFWs
Working abroad is not without its difficulties. OFWs often face harsh working conditions, discrimination, and exploitation. Many work in low-status jobs, such as domestic helpers, construction workers, and factory laborers, where they are vulnerable to abuse and unfair treatment2. Female OFWs, in particular, are disproportionately affected by these challenges, as they are more likely to experience gender-based discrimination and exploitation2.

The Philippine government has implemented various measures to protect the rights and welfare of OFWs. These include bilateral agreements with host countries, legal assistance, and support services provided by the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA). Despite these efforts, ensuring the safety and well-being of OFWs remains a complex and ongoing challenge.

The Role of OFWs in National Development

With over half of the population under the age of 30, the energy, idealism, and innovative spirit of young Filipinos are crucial in shaping the future of the country. This editorial explores the significant role of the youth in Philippine politics, their contributions, challenges, and the potential they hold in driving meaningful change.

The Growing Influence of Youth in Politics
The influence of the youth in Philippine politics has been steadily increasing over the years. In the 2022 presidential elections, voters aged 18 to 30 made up 56% of the total registered voters1. This demographic shift underscores the growing political clout of young Filipinos and their potential to shape the country's political direction.

Youth participation in politics is not limited to voting. Many young Filipinos are actively involved in political campaigns, advocacy groups, and social movements. Organizations such as Youth Vote Philippines and the Kabataan Partylist have been instrumental in mobilizing the youth and advocating for their rights2. These groups focus on voter education, environmental protection, human rights, and other critical issues, demonstrating the diverse interests and concerns of the youth.

The Power of Social Media
Social media has emerged as a powerful tool for political engagement among the youth. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram provide young Filipinos with a space to express their opinions, share information, and organize collective actions. During the 2022 elections, social media played a pivotal role in shaping public discourse and mobilizing voters3.

The youth's adeptness at using digital platforms has allowed them to bypass traditional media channels and reach a broader audience. This has led to increased political awareness and participation, as young Filipinos use social media to hold politicians accountable, fact-check information, and advocate for transparency and good governance.

Challenges Faced by the Youth
Despite their growing influence, young Filipinos face several challenges in their political engagement. One of the primary obstacles is the prevalence of political dynasties and entrenched political elites. These powerful families often dominate local and national politics, making it difficult for new and young leaders to emerge4.

Additionally, the youth often encounter skepticism and resistance from older generations who may dismiss their views as naive or uninformed. This generational divide can hinder meaningful dialogue and collaboration between different age groups.

Economic barriers also play a significant role in limiting youth participation in politics.

196,Copilot,"The concept of federalism has been a topic of significant debate in the Philippines for many years. As the nation grapples with issues of regional inequality, centralized governance, and inefficiencies in public administration, federalism is proposed as a potential solution to these longstanding challenges. This editorial explores the idea of federalism in the Philippine context, its potential benefits, challenges, and the steps needed to make it a reality.

Understanding Federalism
Federalism is a system of government where power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. In a federal system, these political units have significant autonomy and control over their own affairs, while the central government retains authority over national matters such as defense, foreign policy, and monetary policy1.

In the Philippines, the idea of federalism is not new. It was first suggested by national hero José Rizal in his essay ""Filipinas dentro de cien años"" (""The Philippines a Century Hence"") published in 18891. The concept gained further traction during the revolutionary period, with leaders like Emilio Aguinaldo and Apolinario Mabini advocating for a federal system to address the diverse needs of the archipelago1.

The Case for Federalism
Proponents of federalism argue that it can address several key issues facing the Philippines:

Decentralization of Power: One of the primary arguments for federalism is the decentralization of power. The current unitary system is highly centralized, with significant political and economic power concentrated in Metro Manila. This centralization has led to regional disparities, with wealth and development heavily skewed towards the capital2. Federalism would allow for a more equitable distribution of resources and decision-making authority, empowering local governments to address their unique needs and priorities.

Economic Development: By granting regions greater control over their own economic policies and resources, federalism can promote more balanced and inclusive economic development. Regions would have the autonomy to develop their own economic strategies, attract investments, and implement infrastructure projects tailored to their specific needs2. This could lead to increased economic activity and job creation in underdeveloped areas, reducing the economic divide between regions.

Improved Governance: Federalism can lead to improved governance by bringing government closer to the people. Local governments, being more attuned to the needs and concerns of their constituents, can provide more responsive and effective public services3. Additionally, federalism can foster healthy competition among regions, encouraging innovation and efficiency in governance.

Peace and Stability: In regions like Mindanao, where there are long-standing issues of conflict and insurgency, federalism is seen as a potential solution to address grievances and promote peace. By granting greater autonomy to regions with distinct cultural and historical identities, federalism can help address the root causes of conflict and foster a sense of inclusion and self-determination3.

Challenges and Concerns
While federalism offers several potential benefits, it also presents significant challenges and concerns:

Implementation Complexity: Transitioning to a federal system is a complex and challenging process. It requires significant constitutional amendments, the creation of new political and administrative structures, and the redistribution of powers and resources. Ensuring a smooth and effective transition would require careful planning, extensive consultations, and broad public support.

Risk of Inequality: There is a concern that federalism could exacerbate regional inequalities rather than alleviate them. Wealthier regions with more resources and economic opportunities may continue to prosper, while poorer regions may struggle to keep up. To address this, mechanisms for equitable resource distribution and financial support for less developed regions would need to be established.

Political Resistance: Federalism faces significant political resistance from various sectors, including entrenched political elites who may fear losing power and influence. Additionally, there are concerns that federalism could lead to political fragmentation and weaken national unity. Building consensus and addressing these concerns would be crucial for the successful implementation of federalism.

Public Awareness and Support: For federalism to succeed, it is essential to build public awareness and support. Many Filipinos may not fully understand the concept of federalism and its implications. Comprehensive information campaigns, public consultations, and educational initiatives would be necessary to engage the public and build a broad base of support.

Steps Towards Federalism
To move towards federalism, several key steps need to be taken:

Constitutional Amendments: The transition to a federal system would require significant amendments to the 1987 Constitution. This would involve a thorough review of the existing constitution, drafting of new provisions, and approval through a constitutional convention or constituent assembly.

Institutional Reforms: Establishing a federal system would require the creation of new political and administrative institutions at the regional level. This includes the establishment of regional governments, legislative bodies, and judicial systems. Ensuring that these institutions are transparent, accountable, and effective would be crucial for the success of federalism.

Capacity Building: Building the capacity of local governments to manage their own affairs is essential for federalism to work. This includes providing training and resources to local officials, improving local governance structures, and enhancing the delivery of public services.

Equitable Resource Distribution: Mechanisms for equitable resource distribution and financial support for less developed regions would need to be established. This includes creating a system of intergovernmental transfers, revenue-sharing arrangements, and development funds to ensure that all regions have the resources they need to thrive.

Public Engagement: Engaging the public in the federalism debate is crucial for building support and ensuring a smooth transition. This includes conducting public consultations, information campaigns, and educational initiatives to raise awareness and address concerns.

Conclusion
Federalism presents a promising path for addressing the longstanding issues of regional inequality, centralized governance, and inefficiencies in public administration in the Philippines. By decentralizing power, promoting economic development, improving governance, and fostering peace and stability, federalism has the potential to transform the nation's political landscape.

However, the transition to a federal system is not without challenges. It requires careful planning, extensive consultations, and broad public support. By addressing these challenges and taking the necessary steps towards federalism, the Philippines can build a more inclusive, equitable, and prosperous future for all its citizens.

As the nation continues to explore the possibility of federalism, it is essential to engage all stakeholders, including the youth, civil society, and political leaders, in the debate. By working together, the Philippines can pave the way for a brighter and more sustainable future under a federal system of government.",1
197,Copilot,"Election campaign financial transparency is a cornerstone of democratic governance. It ensures that elections are fair, candidates are accountable, and the public can trust the electoral process. In the Philippines, the issue of campaign finance transparency has been a subject of ongoing debate and reform. This editorial explores the current state of election campaign financial transparency in the Philippines, the challenges faced, and the steps needed to enhance transparency and accountability in the electoral process.

The Current State of Campaign Finance Transparency
The Philippines has established a legal framework to promote transparency in election campaign financing. Key laws and regulations include the Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881), Republic Act No. 7166, and various resolutions issued by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC)1. These laws require candidates, political parties, and contributors to disclose their financial activities related to election campaigns through the submission of Statements of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE).

The SOCE is a crucial document that provides a detailed account of all contributions received and expenditures made during the campaign period1. It includes information on cash and in-kind contributions, the sources of these contributions, and itemized expenses such as advertisements, rallies, and staff salaries. The SOCE must be submitted within 30 days after the election, and failure to comply can result in penalties, including fines and disqualification from holding public office1.

Challenges to Financial Transparency
Despite the legal framework in place, several challenges hinder the effective implementation of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines:

Inadequate Enforcement: One of the primary challenges is the inadequate enforcement of existing laws. While candidates and parties are required to submit their SOCEs, there are concerns about the accuracy and completeness of these reports. The COMELEC, responsible for overseeing compliance, often lacks the resources and capacity to thoroughly audit and verify the submitted documents2. This can lead to underreporting or misreporting of campaign finances.

Lack of Donor Transparency: Another significant issue is the lack of transparency regarding the sources of campaign contributions. While the law requires the disclosure of donor information, there are instances where contributions are made through intermediaries or shell organizations to obscure the true source2. This lack of transparency can lead to undue influence by wealthy individuals or special interest groups, undermining the integrity of the electoral process.

High Campaign Costs: The high cost of running for office in the Philippines exacerbates the challenges of campaign finance transparency. Candidates often rely on substantial financial support from donors, which can create opportunities for corruption and patronage3. The pressure to raise large sums of money can also lead candidates to engage in questionable fundraising practices.

Public Awareness and Engagement: Public awareness and engagement in campaign finance issues are relatively low. Many voters are not fully aware of the importance of financial transparency in elections or how to access and interpret SOCEs. This lack of awareness limits public scrutiny and accountability.

Steps to Enhance Financial Transparency
Addressing the challenges of campaign finance transparency requires a comprehensive approach that involves legal reforms, institutional strengthening, and public engagement. Here are some key steps that can be taken to enhance transparency and accountability in election campaign financing:

Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms: Enhancing the capacity of the COMELEC to enforce campaign finance laws is crucial. This includes providing adequate resources for auditing and verification of SOCEs, as well as implementing stricter penalties for non-compliance. Establishing an independent body to oversee campaign finance could also help ensure impartiality and effectiveness2.

Improving Donor Transparency: To address the issue of donor transparency, stricter regulations on the disclosure of contributions are needed. This includes requiring detailed information on the ultimate source of contributions and implementing measures to prevent the use of intermediaries or shell organizations. Public access to donor information should be facilitated to enable greater scrutiny2.

Regulating Campaign Spending: Implementing reasonable limits on campaign spending can help reduce the reliance on large donations and level the playing field for candidates. Recent legislative efforts, such as House Bill No. 8370, which proposes to increase the limits on authorized campaign spending, aim to reflect current economic realities while promoting transparency3. However, these limits must be accompanied by robust enforcement mechanisms to be effective.

Enhancing Public Awareness and Engagement: Increasing public awareness and engagement in campaign finance issues is essential for promoting transparency and accountability. This can be achieved through voter education campaigns, public forums, and the use of digital platforms to disseminate information on campaign finance. Encouraging media coverage and investigative journalism on campaign finance issues can also help raise awareness and promote accountability3.

Leveraging Technology: Utilizing technology can enhance transparency and accessibility of campaign finance information. Developing online platforms where SOCEs and donor information can be easily accessed and analyzed by the public can promote greater scrutiny and accountability. Additionally, implementing digital reporting systems can streamline the submission and auditing of campaign finance reports2.

Conclusion
Election campaign financial transparency is vital for ensuring the integrity of the electoral process and maintaining public trust in democratic institutions. While the Philippines has made progress in establishing a legal framework for campaign finance transparency, significant challenges remain. By strengthening enforcement mechanisms, improving donor transparency, regulating campaign spending, enhancing public awareness, and leveraging technology, the country can make meaningful strides towards a more transparent and accountable electoral system.

As the Philippines prepares for future elections, it is crucial to prioritize campaign finance transparency and address the challenges that undermine it. By doing so, the nation can build a more robust and inclusive democracy where the voices of all citizens are heard, and the influence of money in politics is minimized.",1
198,Copilot,"Mental health stigma remains a significant barrier to mental wellness in the Philippines. Despite recent progress, many Filipinos still face prejudice and discrimination when dealing with mental health issues. This editorial explores the roots of mental health stigma in the Philippines, its impact on individuals and society, and the steps needed to foster a more understanding and supportive environment.

The Roots of Mental Health Stigma
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is deeply rooted in cultural beliefs and social norms. Traditionally, mental illness has been viewed through a lens of judgment and misconception, leading to exclusion and discrimination1. Several factors contribute to this stigma:

Cultural Resilience: Filipinos pride themselves on their resilience and ability to endure hardships. This cultural trait, while admirable, often leads to the downplaying of mental health issues. Many Filipinos believe that mental health problems can be overcome through sheer willpower and that seeking help is a sign of weakness1.

Language and Terminology: The local language reflects the limitations in understanding mental health. Terms like ""baliw"" (crazy) are often used to describe a wide range of mental health conditions, perpetuating negative stereotypes and misconceptions1.

Lack of Public Health Education: There is a significant lack of public health education regarding mental health. Many Filipinos are not fully aware of the distinctions between different mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This lack of knowledge contributes to fear and misunderstanding1.

The Impact of Stigma
The stigma surrounding mental health has profound effects on individuals and society as a whole:

Barriers to Seeking Help: Stigma often prevents individuals from seeking the help they need. Fear of being judged or labeled as ""crazy"" can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating mental health conditions2. Many Filipinos choose to self-diagnose or ignore their symptoms, hoping they will go away on their own2.

Social Isolation: Individuals with mental health conditions often face social isolation and exclusion. They may be shunned by their communities, leading to feelings of loneliness and hopelessness. This isolation can worsen mental health conditions and hinder recovery2.

Economic Impact: Mental health stigma also has economic implications. Untreated mental health conditions can lead to decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher healthcare costs. The economic burden of mental health issues is significant, affecting not only individuals but also their families and communities3.

Progress and Legislative Efforts
Despite these challenges, there have been significant strides towards addressing mental health stigma in the Philippines. In 2018, the Mental Health Act (Republic Act No. 11036) was signed into law after nearly 20 years in Congress1. This landmark legislation affirms mental health as a basic human right and aims to integrate mental health services into the public health system.

The Mental Health Act mandates the establishment of mental health services at the community level, ensuring that mental health care is accessible to all Filipinos1. It also promotes mental health education and awareness programs to combat stigma and discrimination. The Department of Health (DOH) has recognized depression as a serious health condition, highlighting the need for comprehensive mental health care1.

Steps to Combat Mental Health Stigma
Addressing mental health stigma requires a multifaceted approach that involves education, advocacy, and community engagement. Here are some key steps that can help combat stigma and promote mental wellness:

Public Education Campaigns: Increasing public awareness and understanding of mental health is crucial. Public education campaigns can help dispel myths and misconceptions about mental health conditions. These campaigns should emphasize that mental health issues are common and treatable, and that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness1.

Mental Health Education in Schools: Integrating mental health education into school curricula can help foster a more supportive and understanding environment for young people. Teaching students about mental health, coping strategies, and how to seek help can reduce stigma and promote early intervention1.

Workplace Mental Health Programs: Employers can play a significant role in promoting mental wellness by implementing workplace mental health programs. These programs can provide employees with access to mental health resources, support services, and training on how to recognize and address mental health issues2.

Community Support Networks: Building strong community support networks can help individuals with mental health conditions feel less isolated. Community organizations, religious groups, and local leaders can provide support and advocacy for mental health initiatives2.

Media Representation: The media has a powerful influence on public perceptions of mental health. Promoting accurate and compassionate portrayals of mental health conditions in the media can help reduce stigma and encourage more open discussions about mental health3.

Conclusion
Mental health stigma remains a significant challenge in the Philippines, but progress is being made. By addressing the root causes of stigma and promoting education, advocacy, and community support, the nation can create a more understanding and supportive environment for individuals with mental health conditions.

The journey towards breaking the silence and addressing mental health stigma is not easy, but it is essential for the well-being and prosperity of the Filipino people. By working together, the government, private sector, and civil society can create a more inclusive and compassionate society where mental health is recognized as a vital component of overall health.

As we continue to push for change, it is crucial to remember that mental health is a shared responsibility. Each of us has a role to play in promoting mental wellness and combating stigma. By fostering a culture of acceptance and understanding, we can ensure that no one has to face mental health challenges alone.",1
199,Copilot,"The Philippines, a nation known for its vibrant culture and rapid economic growth, is facing significant challenges in urban congestion and housing shortages. As the population continues to grow and urbanize, these issues have become more pronounced, affecting the quality of life for millions of Filipinos. This editorial explores the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines.

The Causes of Urban Congestion
Urban congestion in the Philippines is a multifaceted problem with several contributing factors:

Rapid Urbanization: The Philippines has experienced rapid urbanization over the past few decades. Cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have seen significant population growth as people migrate from rural areas in search of better economic opportunities1. This influx of people has put immense pressure on urban infrastructure, leading to congestion.

Inadequate Public Transportation: The public transportation system in the Philippines is often inadequate and inefficient. Many Filipinos rely on jeepneys, buses, and tricycles, which are frequently overcrowded and poorly maintained2. The limited capacity and reliability of public transportation force many to use private vehicles, exacerbating traffic congestion.

Poor Urban Planning: Urban planning in the Philippines has not kept pace with the rapid growth of cities. Many urban areas lack proper zoning regulations and infrastructure development, leading to haphazard construction and inefficient land use2. This lack of planning contributes to traffic congestion and overcrowded living conditions.

Economic Disparities: Economic disparities also play a role in urban congestion. Many low-income families cannot afford to live near their workplaces and are forced to commute long distances. This daily migration of workers adds to the congestion on roads and public transportation systems2.

The Impact of Urban Congestion
The impact of urban congestion on the Philippines is far-reaching and affects various aspects of daily life:

Economic Costs: Traffic congestion leads to significant economic costs. According to a study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), traffic congestion in Metro Manila alone costs the economy approximately PHP 3.5 billion daily due to lost productivity and increased fuel consumption3. These costs are expected to rise if the issue is not addressed.

Environmental Degradation: The high volume of vehicles on the road contributes to air pollution and environmental degradation. Emissions from cars, buses, and jeepneys release harmful pollutants into the air, affecting public health and contributing to climate change3.

Reduced Quality of Life: Urban congestion reduces the quality of life for many Filipinos. Long commutes, traffic jams, and overcrowded public transportation systems lead to stress, fatigue, and decreased time for family and leisure activities3. The constant struggle with traffic also affects mental health and overall well-being.

The Housing Shortage Crisis
In addition to urban congestion, the Philippines is grappling with a severe housing shortage. The country faces a housing deficit of approximately 6.5 million units, a number projected to balloon to 22 million by 2040 if left unaddressed4. Several factors contribute to this crisis:

Rapid Population Growth: The Philippines has one of the highest population growth rates in Southeast Asia. The increasing population puts pressure on housing supplies, particularly in urban areas where many Filipinos flock for job opportunities4.

High Land and Construction Costs: The high cost of land and construction materials makes it difficult to develop affordable housing. Many developers focus on high-end residential projects, leaving low-income families with limited options4. The lack of affordable housing forces many to live in informal settlements or substandard conditions.

Bureaucratic Hurdles: The process of acquiring permits and approvals for housing projects is often slow and cumbersome. Bureaucratic red tape and corruption can delay construction and increase costs, deterring private investment in low-cost housing4.

Informal Settlements: A significant portion of the population lives in informal settlements, often in high-risk areas like riverbanks and steep slopes. These settlements lack basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity, exacerbating the housing crisis4.

The Impact of Housing Shortages
The housing shortage crisis has profound implications for individuals and society:

Increased Poverty: The lack of affordable housing contributes to increased poverty and inequality. Many low-income families spend a significant portion of their income on rent, leaving little for other essential needs such as food, education, and healthcare5.

Health and Safety Risks: Living in substandard housing or informal settlements poses significant health and safety risks. Poor living conditions can lead to the spread of diseases, while the lack of proper infrastructure increases vulnerability to natural disasters5.

Social Unrest: The housing crisis can lead to social unrest and instability. The growing gap between affluent homeowners and the underprivileged can fuel tensions and contribute to political instability5.

Potential Solutions
Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach. Here are some potential solutions:

Improving Public Transportation: Investing in efficient and reliable public transportation systems is crucial for reducing urban congestion. Expanding and modernizing the existing network of buses, trains, and jeepneys can provide commuters with viable alternatives to private vehicles2. Implementing policies that promote the use of public transportation, such as dedicated bus lanes and affordable fares, can also help alleviate congestion.

Implementing zoning regulations, developing green spaces, and promoting mixed-use developments can create more livable and efficient urban areas2. Encouraging the construction of high-density housing near employment centers can reduce the need for long commutes.

Affordable Housing Initiatives: The government must prioritize affordable housing initiatives to address the housing shortage crisis. Programs such as the Pambansang Pabahay Para sa Pilipino (4PH) aim to construct 1 million housing units annually until 20284. Providing subsidies, reducing loan interest rates, and offering incentives to private developers can make housing more accessible to low-income families.

Streamlining Bureaucratic Processes: Simplifying and streamlining the process of acquiring permits and approvals for housing projects can encourage private investment in low-cost housing. Reducing bureaucratic red tape and combating corruption can expedite construction and development4.

Community Engagement and Support: Engaging communities in the planning and implementation of housing projects can ensure that their needs and preferences are considered. Providing support services such as skills training, livelihood programs, and access to basic services can help improve the living conditions of informal settlers5.

Conclusion
Urban congestion and housing shortages are pressing issues that require immediate and effective solutions. By addressing the root causes and implementing comprehensive strategies, the Philippines can create more livable, sustainable, and inclusive urban environments. The journey towards resolving these challenges is complex, but with coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and civil society, a brighter future is within reach for all Filipinos.",1
200,Copilot,"Plastic pollution is a pressing environmental issue that has reached alarming levels globally, and the Philippines is at the forefront of this crisis. As one of the world's largest contributors to ocean plastic waste, the Philippines faces significant challenges in managing plastic pollution. This editorial explores the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to the plastic pollution problem in the Philippines, highlighting the urgent need for collective action.

The Scale of the Problem
The Philippines generates over 2.7 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, with approximately 20% of this waste entering the ocean1. This staggering figure makes the Philippines the world's top ocean plastic polluter, contributing nearly three times more plastic waste to the oceans than the second-closest country1. The country's rivers, particularly the Pasig River, are major conduits for plastic waste, with seven of the world's top 10 plastic-polluting rivers located in the Philippines1.

Causes of Plastic Pollution
Several factors contribute to the severe plastic pollution problem in the Philippines:

Urban Runoff and Improper Waste Disposal: A significant portion of plastic waste is generated by households and businesses in metropolitan areas like Manila. Urban runoff, combined with improper waste disposal practices, leads to large amounts of plastic waste entering waterways and eventually the ocean1.

Inadequate Waste Management Infrastructure: The waste management infrastructure in the Philippines is often insufficient to handle the volume of waste generated. Only about 33% of the country's waste is managed correctly through collection and disposal, while the rest ends up in landfills or the ocean1. The lack of sanitary landfills and strict regulations on building new ones exacerbate the problem2.

Single-Use Plastics: The widespread use of single-use plastics, such as plastic bags, straws, and packaging, contributes significantly to plastic pollution. These items are often discarded after a single use and are not biodegradable, leading to long-term environmental damage2.

Economic and Social Factors: Economic disparities and lack of public awareness also play a role in plastic pollution. Many low-income communities lack access to proper waste disposal facilities and are more likely to dispose of waste improperly2. Additionally, there is a need for greater public education on the environmental impact of plastic waste and the importance of proper waste management.

Impacts of Plastic Pollution
The impacts of plastic pollution in the Philippines are far-reaching and affect both the environment and human health:

Environmental Degradation: Plastic pollution poses a dire threat to marine ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion, starvation, and death1. Mangrove forests and coral reefs, which are critical for coastal protection and marine biodiversity, are increasingly filled with plastic waste, reducing their ability to support marine life and protect against erosion1.

Economic Costs: Plastic pollution has significant economic implications, particularly for coastal communities that rely on fishing and tourism. The presence of plastic waste on beaches and in the water can lead to reduced fish stocks and a decline in tourism, both of which are critical sources of income for these communities1.

Human Health Risks: Plastic pollution also poses health risks to humans. Microplastics, which are tiny plastic particles that result from the breakdown of larger plastic items, can enter the food chain and be ingested by humans. The long-term health effects of microplastic ingestion are still being studied, but there is growing concern about their potential impact on human health1.

Legislative and Policy Efforts
In response to the growing plastic pollution crisis, the Philippine government has taken several legislative and policy measures:

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Law: In 2023, the Philippines passed the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) law, which requires businesses with assets worth over ₱100 million to take responsibility for the plastic waste they produce3. This law mandates that companies implement measures to reduce, recover, and recycle plastic waste, promoting a circular economy approach.

Plastic Bag Bans and Regulations: Several local government units (LGUs) have implemented bans or regulations on single-use plastics, such as plastic bags and straws3. These measures aim to reduce the consumption of single-use plastics and encourage the use of reusable alternatives.

Waste Management Programs: The government has also launched various waste management programs to improve waste collection, recycling, and disposal. These programs include public awareness campaigns, community-based waste management initiatives, and partnerships with private sector organizations3.

Potential Solutions
Addressing plastic pollution in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach. Here are some potential solutions:

Strengthening Waste Management Infrastructure: Investing in waste management infrastructure is crucial for reducing plastic pollution. This includes building more sanitary landfills, improving waste collection systems, and developing recycling facilities2. Public-private partnerships can play a key role in financing and implementing these infrastructure projects.

Promoting a Circular Economy: Transitioning to a circular economy, where products are designed to be reused, repaired, and recycled, can significantly reduce plastic waste. Encouraging businesses to adopt sustainable practices and consumers to choose eco-friendly products can help promote a circular economy2.

Enhancing Public Education and Awareness: Increasing public awareness about the environmental impact of plastic pollution and the importance of proper waste management is essential. Public education campaigns, school programs, and community outreach initiatives can help change behaviors and promote responsible waste disposal2.

Supporting Innovation and Research: Investing in research and innovation can lead to the development of new technologies and materials that reduce plastic waste. This includes biodegradable plastics, advanced recycling methods, and waste-to-energy technologies3.

Strengthening Legislation and Enforcement: Strengthening existing laws and regulations on plastic waste management and ensuring their effective enforcement is crucial. This includes imposing stricter penalties for non-compliance and providing incentives for businesses that adopt sustainable practices3.

Conclusion
Plastic pollution is a critical environmental issue that requires urgent action. The Philippines, as one of the world's largest contributors to ocean plastic waste, has a responsibility to address this crisis. By strengthening waste management infrastructure, promoting a circular economy, enhancing public education, supporting innovation, and strengthening legislation, the Philippines can make significant strides towards reducing plastic pollution and protecting its environment.

The journey towards a plastic-free Philippines is challenging, but it is essential for the well-being of the environment and future generations. By working together, the government, private sector, and civil society can create a more sustainable and resilient nation where plastic pollution is a thing of the past.",1

    "# new_text = \"Even the most talented scriptwriters of the best Netflix series would probably find their jaws dropping in bewilderment and shock with all the plot twists in this seemingly never-ending Alice in Wonderland fairytale, Manila edition. It’s as bizarre as it can get. Here is Alice, back in Manila via a private jet after being caught by Indonesian authorities, still making a mockery of our institutions, our law-enforcement agencies, our Immigration policies and our Senate. Alice told a Senate panel on Monday that they left the country via a yacht which they boarded right in the City of Manila. However, she isn’t very sure which part of the Manila harbor – the busiest port in the country – they departed from. This is the latest script that’s being fed to everyone following this edge-of-your seat drama. It’s different from the first version which said that they left on a small boat from Pangasinan. Either she is lying to keep the narrative confusing or she’s really hopelessly and impossibly bizarre. The truth is, our senators may never be able to fully unmask Alice Guo or to really squeeze the whole truth from her. However, it’s not a futile investigation. It has, in fact, led to policy changes, including a ban on Philippine offshore gaming operations. But more importantly, this whole Alice in Wonderland saga is pointing to a very disturbing reality in the Philippines, which our authorities must immediately address. I’m talking about the existence of syndicates issuing fake birth certificates and fake passports or illegally issuing such legitimate documents. This is appalling, disturbing and most of all a treachery to our people and our country. This is a serious security concern and each and every Filipino who is involved in this crime is a traitor of the worst kind and must be dealt with as such. In ancient Greece, high treason was punished severely, including the loss of citizenship for oneself and family. Here in our country today, these traitors among us must be brought to justice. Imagine what could happen if our official documents are forged, bootlegged or sold illegally. Never mind the fact that the most ordinary of ordinary Filipinos need to spend hours if not days just to get their official documents – whether it’s a birth certificate, a passport or a driver’s license. Years ago, for example, I remember a domestic helper who missed her flight to Malaysia because she could not get a passport. Why? Because she needed two government IDs but she only had one, a Philippine Postal ID. Her employer had to enroll her in a driving school so she could get a driver’s license, which would then serve as her second ID so she could get a passport. But by then it was too late. But as I said, never mind that. Filipinos are used to incompetence anyway. What is more disturbing, however, is the impact of this on our security. If our passports and birth certificates can easily be acquired illegally for a song, the same goes for land registration titles and other crucial documents. We may wake up one day and a big portion of our country is already owned by foreigners who managed to produce fake IDs or fake land titles in acquiring properties. We must also guard our borders because as Alice Guo has clearly shown, it’s so easy to escape the country, especially with our porous borders unguarded. Security is made worse by the fact that border patrols and immigration authorities just conveniently look the other way to help fugitives escape the law. What is our society, really, but a tale of dark comedy in continuous motion, if not an edge-of-your seat Netflix series playing in a loop over and over. If this Alice in Wonderland saga would help solve one thing, let it be this problem of fake documents and ID mills. For instance, there is supposedly a fake birth certificate factory in Davao, catering to mostly Chinese nationals. Such treacherous activities are alarming and President Marcos should not allow this to continue right under his nose. Unless we bring these perpetrators to justice and quash the syndicates they work for, we may remain a nation of fools and traitors. Our country is a stark and sad reminder of how greed, selfishness and betrayal have, time and time again, sold this nation’s soul. On the lighter side, “Fernando Zóbel: The Future of the Past” has arrived in Asia, premiering at the Ayala Museum after a four-month run at the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid. The exhibit will feature more than 200 works by the painter Zóbel, including sketchbooks that have never been seen by the public. I missed the vernissage but I was told that the exhibit will run until 2025, in celebration of Ayala Corp.’s 190th founding anniversary, the 100th birth anniversary of Zobel and the 50th anniversary of Ayala Museum.\"\n",

His case also dragged at least three former presidents in order to protect his $50 million business in tobacco and various commercial crops, among others. Then Justice Secretary Jose W. Diokno caused the raid of the offices of 42 of Stonehill’s business establishments in 1962 and the arrest of Stonehill and some of his associates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what was described as six army trucks worth of incriminating evidence, Stonehill was accused of tax evasion, economic sabotage, and various other charges that could have been established by his Blue Book which mysteriously went missing. It contained the names of Filipino politicians and government officials who were alleged to have received bribe money from the American businessman. Before the case could be tried in court, Stonehill was subsequently deported by Malacañang.\n",

    "Alice Guo treated Philippine law like rag when all evidence points to her faking her birth circumstances to gain entry into the Philippines and become a Filipino citizen. If she is indeed non-Filipino and therefore disqualified, she violated our electoral law when she ran and took her oath of office as mayor of Bamban, Tarlac. This gains credence in the face of Guo’s fingerprints being a perfect match with a Chinese national, Guo Hua Ping. Guo could not explain how she was able to construct the multibillion building complex of POGO business in Tarlac. It was impossible because her tax returns and SALN could only support a modest lifestyle.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Reuters reported, even as Philippine authorities had filed several counts of money laundering, Guo continues to insist “she is natural-born Philippine citizen facing ‘malicious accusations,’ and had no knowledge of criminality.” This is strange because she could not even remember her roots, even her playmates while growing up.\n",
    "\n",
    "For weeks before she escaped from the Philippines to Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, our elected senators could not get through her. It was a blank wall for them when Guo would always retort that she grew up in a farm, her only close friends were the farmhands in their piggery, or when confronted by documentary evidence of her true nationality, that she could not remember anymore. \n",

She could not have sustained her POGO and alleged illegal activities if law enforcers did not turn a blind eye. She could not have escaped from the Philippines in July without official intervention. \n",

    "It's a sad commentary that even notarization of public documents could be dragged into this scandal. As Rappler reported, a lawyer “committed lapses when he notarized the counter-affidavit of suspended Bamban Mayor Alice Guo in relation to a DOJ human trafficking complaint on Aug. 14.” By that time, Guo was already out of the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "When she was finally arrested by Indonesian Interpol in Tangerang, it was disclosed that a Singaporean national helped Guo book four hotel rooms in Batam island. And to the surprise of many, no less than Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos and PNP Chief PGen. Rommel Marbil who served the Senate arrest warrant to Guo.

    "There was little progress during the Senate hearing, notwithstanding the competent leadership of Senator Risa Hontiveros. All that Guo had to do to frustrate the senators’ spirited questioning was to claim innocence, short memory or the risk of incriminating herself. \n",
    "\n",
    "If at all, Guo even taught the Senate what to do and this was to convert the public hearing into an executive session. Only then could she disclose to the Senate who engineered her escape. When the Senate refused, Guo was persuaded to write on a piece of paper the name of the person who helped her escape. By the disclosure of two senators, another non-Filipino disregarded the Senate arrest warrant by helping Guo and her siblings and associates avoid arrest through the southern backdoor. \n",

    "Nothing should surprise us anymore when non-Filipinos have the gall to disrespect our legal and justice system. We ourselves have nurtured such a habit of setting aside the law and just treating it as an elephant in the room, and in many cases, too, as a doormat.\n",

    "This is in contrast to what the Philippines aspired for a “people-centered, clean and efficient governance” in the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022. In Chapter 5, we as a people, expressed our adherence to a high-trust society where “citizens obey the law, they willingly pay the correct taxes trusting that government will prudently manage the fiscal resources.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the cornerstone of a high-trust society is the trust in government. \n",

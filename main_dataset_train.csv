1,John Nery,"The success of the Marcos-Duterte electoral alliance in 2022 was so massive it could be said that the political equivalent of Newton’s law of inertia applied to it. A body moving at constant speed in a straight line will continue moving at constant speed in a straight line unless a force acted upon it. The alliance – if all went well, if the different parts moved at the same speed and kept to the same line – had a lock on the 2028 presidential election, which in our part of the universe determines other political possibilities. And then a force acted upon it. Now the alliance has descended into a war of the dynasties, between the Marcoses and the Dutertes, and an opening is starting to form, not necessarily for the political opposition but perhaps for a political third force led by someone like the populist, and popular, Senator Raffy Tulfo.But the reality of politics has always been messy; perhaps Newton’s laws of motion cannot really explain it. For some analysts, the break between the Marcoses and the Dutertes was inevitable; inertia was never an explanation. But some politicians believed in the alliance, and continue to do so even in the middle of the dynastic war; the law of action and reaction governs their pragmatic attempts to end it. Another way to look at the political situation today, to understand the “chaos” affecting the political class, is to borrow the theory at the heart of the popular Netflix series, 3-Body Problem, based on Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem trilogy. What is the three-body problem? The character Wang Miao explains: “It’s actually pretty simple. The reason why the sun’s motion seems patternless is because our world has three suns. Under the influence of their mutually perturbing gravitational attraction, their movements are unpredictable – the three-body problem. When our planet revolves around one of the suns in a stable orbit, that’s a Stable Era. When one or more of the other suns move within a certain distance, their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it’s orbiting, causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns. That’s a Chaotic Era. After an uncertain amount of time, our planet is once again pulled into a temporary orbit and another Stable Era begins. This is a football game at the scale of the universe. The players are the three suns, and our planet is the football.” (This excerpt is of course from the Ken Liu translation.) The three suns in the second Marcos administration are President Marcos, his older sister Senator Imee Marcos, and his cousin Speaker Martin Romualdez. We can measure their gravitational pull on the planet of Philippine politics according to three factors: the scale of rehabilitation of the Marcos legacy and name, the question of presidential succession, and the choice of primary geopolitical partner. There must be other criteria, but I suggest that these three form the core. These describe their hold on their moons, account for the difference in their orbits – and explain why the Stable Era promised by the UniTeam’s unprecedented victory has deteriorated into a Chaotic Era. Marcos legacy. I think that President Marcos understands his election in 2022 as a completion of the task his family imposed on him since at least 1995, the first time he ran for national office; he has rehabilitated the Marcos name simply by winning the office his father held for 20 years. His election created the minimum condition of rehabilitation – that the public regard his father no longer as a dictator but as “just another” president, the first Marcos – and I think he is happy to claim the win. Senator Marcos’s definition of rehabilitation is much broader. She wants public opinion to reflect how she thinks of her father, as a great man wronged by history. She wants to restore her father to an imagined gallery of greatness, and this requires nothing less than a repudiation of the Edsa People Power uprising. (On rereading, I see that my July 2022 column “The four REs of the Marcos restoration” actually tracks Imee’s position more closely than her brother’s.) For Imee, it is not enough for the first Marcos to be seen as just another president. Speaker Romualdez’s idea of rehabilitation is just as expansive, but in a different direction. He expects it to cover not only the Marcoses but the Romualdezes too. For him, the true measure of rehabilitation is if another member of their extended family succeeds his cousin. His reading has disturbed others in the political class, even those who warmly welcomed the return of the Marcoses to Malacañang, because it unnecessarily tests the boundaries of political power. One may be willing to concede power to a family for six years, but 12? Presidential Succession. Marcos continues to keep his personal relationship with his vice president warm, even in the face of outright hostility and insolent language from his predecessor the former president and the two Duterte sons. I think he is pragmatic enough to accept a Duterte as a successor, if that is the way his political interests lie; at the same time, he cannot but be open to a Romualdez or a Tulfo, for the same reason. But it seems clear that his influential wife’s counsel is what he will keep. This sub-factor is a particular sticking point with other members of the political class, especially the Dutertes. Imee Marcos was one of Rodrigo Duterte’s original supporters in his long-shot campaign for the presidency in 2016, and was instrumental in convincing Duterte’s more popular daughter Sara to run as Bongbong Marcos’s running mate in 2022. As I see it, she wants her family to honor the explicit or implied agreement with the Dutertes that made the UniTeam tandem possible in the first place: Support Sara for president in 2028. While her definition of political rehabilitation is maximalist, her understanding of the dynamic of presidential elections is much more pragmatic. She sees Sara as still the candidate to beat in 2028 AND also the president who can consolidate the gains of the Marcoses best. From all indications, Speaker Romualdez wants to become the next president. He may still run for a third term as representative of the 1st District of Leyte next year, but his long-term strategy may likely involve a Senate run in 2025. A strong showing would place him in strong contention for 2028. (See Gloria Arroyo in 1995, or Grace Poe in 2013.) The ongoing campaign to raise his profile in different congressional districts is an expensive signal; to give only one example, the constituency-serving facility set up on Kamuning Street in Quezon City, while ostensibly an alliance between the district representative and his wife Yedda Romualdez’s Tingog party-list group, features only one larger-than-life image: his. Superpower Ally. Before Marcos came to power, I thought he would continue moving in the direction set by President Duterte’s pivot to China; his family’s historical ties with Chinese leadership weighed heavily in my estimate. Instead, he has firmly redirected Philippine foreign policy back to Washington DC and the Western alliance. This must stem in part from the recognition that there is an international aspect to the project of rehabilitation; in his view, the course of cleaning up the family name runs through key Western capitals. Senator Marcos would favor a return to the Duterte China-first policy. The language she used in presenting her seven-point plan in September 2022 as Senate foreign affairs committee chair speaks of “engagement” with Beijing, but her remarks since then suggest collaboration rather than engagement, to the extent that today she is seen as the principal non-Duterte defender of China. (She resents this perception.) Romualdez has controversially accompanied the President on many of his foreign travels, in part to assert his idea of “legislative diplomacy” and his ideal of Congress as a full partner of the Executive in foreign policy. But he shares the pro-Western view of his cousin, Ambassador to the United States Babe Romualdez; donated $2 million to fund a Tagalog course in Harvard University; has consistently supported the strengthening of Philippine-American ties. As president, he would likely deepen the Philippine partnership with the United States. Chaotic era. In the last two years, the three suns have each increased in mass. Romualdez’s Lakas-CMD is now the largest single party in Congress, and he has proved that he can make Congress jump through hoops. Imee has reinforced her ties with the Dutertes, who have been welcoming former allies (such as former Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez) back into the fold; at the same time, she has leaned into her role as a dependable source, “good copy,” for the media. The President remains buoyed both by constant travel and the warm welcome of Western allies; the scope of influence of his wife Lisa Araneta Marcos has also widened. As a result, their “mutually perturbing gravitational attraction ” has also grown. The turmoil within the ruling coalition includes many celestial anomalies: a stealthy two-pronged campaign to change the Constitution; open conflict between the Senate and the House; a tightening of the net around key Duterte allies; the suddenly more substantial shadow of the International Criminal Court looming from The Hague; even more aggressive interventions by Beijing in the West Philippine Sea; ever closer ties with Washington, Tokyo, Canberra, London. All this instability can be explained simply. There are three competing centers of gravity within the extended Marcos family.",0
2,John Nery,"The war on Ninoy Aquino’s legacy is a fight the political opposition should welcome, and win. It wasn’t a surprise, but for many who recognize Ninoy Aquino’s heroism, the orchestrated attacks on his legacy on the anniversary of his assassination, subverting the very meaning of his martyrdom, still came as a shock. Maybe it was the brazenness of the deceitful counterclaims, or maybe it was the sheer scale of the networked campaign, or maybe it was the sinking sense that a new nightmare in disinformation and historical denialism had begun – but the blow that shocked many into a defensive crouch was visceral, real. Can all of that history really be denied? The fact that he was killed by Marcos’s soldiers, the fact that millions of people turned out for his funeral, the fact that his sacrifice galvanized the opposition, the fact that his death in 1983 led to the end of the Marcos regime in 1986: Can all of that be deliberately forgotten, or reinterpreted, or hashtagged away? Marcos and Duterte allies are certainly trying. The groundwork had been laid during the Duterte years, when legislation to change the name of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, the country’s main gateway, was first filed. Alarms over the possible removal of the image of Aquino on the P500 bill (part of the design since 1987) and that of his wife, the late president Cory Aquino (included in the design in 2010), were also first raised under the Duterte administration, when the Bangko Sentral initiated a new currency series that replaced heroes with Philippine flora and fauna. But the anti-Ninoy campaign grew in volume and viciousness after Ferdinand Marcos Jr. won the presidency. One of the first bills filed in the 19th Congress sought the renaming of the airport from Aquino to the man with final responsibility for his assassination, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos himself, on the mistaken assumption that Marcos built the airport. A day before the 39th anniversary of the assassination, a handful of police accounts on social media used the hashtags #NinoyNotHero (sic) and #NinoyNPA in bizarre posts that were later taken down. And on the day of the anniversary, the coordinated smear campaign against Aquino erupted into full view: He was denounced as a traitor, tagged as a communist, blamed as a destabilizer or a chaos-maker. And though the August 21 anniversary (which fell on a Sunday this year) remained a national holiday, the main institutions of government kept silent. No statements were issued. In his first State of the Nation Address the previous month, President Marcos Jr. deliberately avoided mentioning Aquino’s name; he spoke of creating “more international airports to help decongest the bottleneck in the Manila Airport.” The policy of official silence on the anniversary, then, was all of a piece.To be sure, Marcos issued Proclamation No. 42 the day after Ninoy Aquino Day, listing the official holidays for 2023; both August 21 and February 25, the anniversary of the People Power revolution that drove the Marcoses from Malacañang, were still on the list. As I wrote before, I expect it will take him three years to finally drop the two holidays.  But I could be wrong. Of the factions in the ruling coalition, there is at least one that is maximalist; it seeks to rehabilitate the father AND degrade the father’s political archrival as quickly as possible. Republic Act 9256, which declared Aquino’s death anniversary a holiday, can be repealed within a matter of months. Coalition Objectives. Why the zeal to erase Ninoy Aquino from history? Most of the parties and factions that comprise the ruling coalition, with the possible exception of the marginalized Arroyo group, are invested in reinterpreting mainstream Philippine history because a national narrative that celebrates Aquino as hero is necessarily a narrative that assumes Marcos as villain. The dictator was gravely ill on the day Aquino was killed; it is very likely that while he approved his wife Imelda’s repeated attempts to warn Aquino against coming back because of the risk of assassination, he did not directly order the killing. He must have anticipated, if not the scale, then at least the kind, of consequences you reap when you turn your rival into a martyr. But Marcos did arrest Aquino when Martial Law took effect; he did imprison Aquino for seven years on made-up charges; he did allow a military court to try, and eventually, convict, a civilian defendant; he did install a dictatorship that denied Filipinos their basic freedoms; he did create the conditions that by the early 1980s had pushed the country to the brink of social upheaval; he did manufacture a subservient military that produced the soldiers who killed Aquino. Marcos bears final responsibility for Aquino’s sprawled corpse on the airport tarmac. That that airport has borne Aquino’s name since December 1987 (through a law that was enacted without the approval of his widow, the president at that time) is a continuing reminder of that ultimate responsibility. That is why President Marcos Jr. couldn’t even say the airport’s full name; his father and his family are implicated every time the name is invoked. The Marcoses have apparently forgiven the late president Fidel Ramos for his crucial role in their ouster; they have not only forgiven their father’s defense secretary, Juan Ponce Enrile, for defecting from the Marcos regime, they have welcomed him into the official family as chief presidential legal counsel. The truth is that many of those who made the EDSA revolution happen have found ways to work with the Marcoses when they returned to political office. In that sense, EDSA as historical event is easier for the Marcos family to live with, or live down. But the Aquinos are a different matter. Ninoy Aquino and his ragtag Lakas ng Bayan party had humiliated Imelda Marcos during the 1978 Interim Batasang Pambansa elections. Aquino had repeatedly rejected Imelda’s many warnings about not coming home. He could have stayed in comfortable exile in the United States, but decided (exactly like Jose Rizal) to return home to almost certain death. That decision led to the collapse of the Marcos regime, and cemented Marcos’ historical reputation, not as the enlightened strongman he believed he was, but as the brutal dictator the assassination revealed him to be. To rehabilitate Marcos’s name and legacy, Aquino’s role in history must be degraded and denied. Opposition Opportunity. It is instructive to remember that when rumors of Aquino’s impending return circulated in 1983, the Marcos-controlled press (in an amazing display of editorial synchronicity) began printing unflattering, previously published stories about the opposition leader. Aquino before his arrest in 1972 was an easy target: rich, glib, flashy young man on the make, surrounded by bodyguards. The stories showed a man of great privilege and even greater ambition. The current campaign against him draws on this portrait – and then adds a layer of outright fabrication. The new script includes old allegations: that he was a communist (or even a founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines); that his absence during the Plaza Miranda bombing of 1971, which was aimed at his fellow Liberal Party members, proved that he was behind the act of terrorism; that he had been naturalized as a Malaysian citizen, and so on. But like Rizal, we remember Aquino because of the last 10 years of his life: seven years in prison and three years in exile changed him, we might even say purified him, and prepared him to be, in the final moment of his life, a hero. I was at that massive funeral for Aquino on August 31, 1983 – 10 years ago on Wednesday. I was one of maybe two million, maybe even three million, who escorted him to his grave. It was the largest funeral in Philippine history, and one of the largest in the world. I was also at EDSA in February 1986, when as many as four million Filipinos thronged the streets. And I was one of the 16.6 million who voted for the 1987 Constitution: an astonishing 77% of all votes cast. I believed then, and I believe now, that all those millions saw Aquino’s sacrifice as a martyrdom, and Aquino as a hero. The bracing thing: Lots of proof exist that Filipinos see Aquino as a hero. Many of the millions who turned out for his funeral or flocked to EDSA and other urban centers elsewhere in the country are still alive; many archives are accessible and easy to use. In other words, the question whether Aquino is a hero, which Marcos and Duterte allies have seeded, is actually a contest that the political opposition should join willingly, because it is winnable. In its present state, the opposition is defensive by default. The war to define Aquino’s heroic legacy, centered on the principle that the Filipino is worth dying for, is an opportunity to go on the offense, to convert hearts and minds, to speak truth with power.

3,John Nery,"One of many lessons from the ongoing Twitter fiasco: Billionaires make up, and bankers believe, all kinds of bullshit. To buy Twitter, Elon Musk had to pay not only the $44-billion acquisition price but also what are called closing costs. The total amount was substantially higher: $46.5 billion. A consortium of major banks, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and Bank of America, provided Musk with almost $13 billion in debt financing. In other words, aside from putting up his own money (largely by selling Tesla stock) and convincing investment funds to take a stake, Musk had to take out a loan. At around the time the acquisition was completed, at the end of October, the banks were already looking at a potential loss of half a billion dollars if they had sold their debt then. Now, according to a Reuters report based on a Financial Times story, the banks are looking to hold on to their debt (that is, not sell them off), having “conceded they will be stuck holding the debt on their books for months or even longer and will probably end up incurring huge losses on the financing package.” Question: How was it possible that ostensibly responsible bankers approved a multi-billion-dollar loan that started losing value the moment the loan was cleared? For ordinary people like you and me, these sums are unreal. Is there any difference between $1 billion and $13 billion, or $44 billion, for the proverbial man or woman on the street? But we presume that bankers (and investors, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs) appreciate the true weight of money. Why then did these bankers back a businessman who did not in fact want to proceed with the acquisition and had to be forced by litigation to complete the purchase? Magical thinking. The answer must lie in a form of collective magical thinking: These bankers and investors believed in Musk, despite the lack of substance in and even the absurdity of his plans for improving Twitter’s business prospects. Last May, the New York Times obtained a copy of the presentation slides – the pitch deck – that Musk used to court investor support for buying Twitter. He projected that from a base of around 7,500 employees, the Twitter workforce would grow to 9,225 this year and to 11,072 in 2025. And yet one of the first things Musk did when he took over Twitter was to fire half of the staff. Over 1,200 more employees resigned after he set a deadline. How can Musk possibly make good on his other grandiose plans for Twitter? He has less than a third of the work force he said needed to be in place by this year. And it’s not as if Musk’s drastic moves were a surprise. His track record at Tesla, the electric-vehicle manufacturer, and at SpaceX, the rocket business, should have warned  bankers and investors that self-created chaos was his playbook. Musk “clearly thrives in existential circumstances,” a former Tesla engineer told the Times. Musk told investors that by 2028 he would grow Twitter’s user base from 217 million in 2021 to 931 million; transform the platform’s payments business from a projected and paltry $15 million in 2023 to about $1.3 billion; and raise company revenue from $5 billion in 2021 to $26.4 billion. These numbers are literally incredible: hard to believe, or even credit. This is the business bullshit that the bankers bought? This is the BS that magical thinking sold. Never mind the Qatari or Saudi investors, who may only need to answer to their sovereigns, but what about the suits in Morgan Stanley, who agreed to loan Musk about $3.5 billion? Do they still have a job? Market mentality. I suppose the answer here is the other side of Musk’s track record; bankers and investors can point to his success at Tesla and at SpaceX. But the free market these capitalists supposedly believe in has in fact been driving down the value of Tesla for a year already. Just last Monday, Bloomberg reported that Musk’s net worth shrank by $8.6 billion. He lost more wealth in one day than the entire fortune of the single richest person in the Philippines, Manny Villar. In the first 11 months of the year, Musk’s net worth fell by an astonishing $100.5 billion – equivalent to about one-fourth of the Philippine GNP. The scale is staggering in itself, but the losses are something else. The cause is clear enough. Fortune magazine noted that since November 2021, when Musk’s wealth was at its peak, “Tesla’s stock has fallen more than 59% as growing recession fears, slowing EV demand, and Musk’s Twitter acquisition have weighed on investors’ confidence.” Tesla is the main source of Musk’s wealth. Aside from internal problems (the most recent recall involved 300,000 cars with a factory defect) and economic difficulties (more expensive raw material, more restrictive China market), Tesla also has to contend with Musk’s new acquisition, Twitter. Some investors “worry that Tesla’s strategy may fall to the wayside” (Fortune); other investors fear that “the billionaire is spreading himself too thin” (Bloomberg). But the real problem is that, in late capitalism, billionaires can lay it on too thick—and bankers, investors, venture capitalists are only too willing, too gullible, to believe them. ",0
4,John Nery,"Of course we all need to be particular about the source of the funds. That is the most important issue. As if to demonstrate the great decline in stature from chief justice of the Supreme Court to ad interim executive secretary and thus temporary chief aide, Lucas Bersamin spent a lot of time in his first press briefing on Tuesday, October 4, offering ridiculous rationalizations for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s weekend getaway to Singapore. The former chief justice did not act at all like a circumspect judge, conscious of the responsibility all public officials bear toward public office. The new executive secretary also did not act any different from the old one, who was accused (even by supporters of President Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte) of a high-handedness born of sheer proximity to power. Instead, Executive Secretary Bersamin made assertions to justify the President’s junket that even law students would have readily picked apart. He prefaced his remarks by saying that he did not have “direct knowledge” of how the President’s trip to Singapore to catch the Formula 1 race was funded. If he was reciting in class, his professor would have ripped this admission wide open. He must have known he would be asked about the Singapore trip; why didn’t he prepare beforehand by determining the source of the funding? Either he was lazy, or unprepared, or irresponsibly incurious. It’s also possible that he made the admission as a way to distance himself from the issue, an attempt to put his answers on less authoritative ground. If he did in fact make that bet, the headlines and stories in the wake of his press briefing show that he wagered wrong. But his admission was merely laying the predicate for his first rationalization: “You don’t need to be too particular about where the funds were sourced.” This is atrocious nonsense, based on the unsaid but false assumption that the President is exempt from standards applied to other public officials. In fact, Bersamin tried to justify this nonsense by referring, broadly, to the implied deference the Administrative Code of 1987 pays, or so he says, to the entire First Family. But nothing in the same Code, or indeed in any other law, says that the basic principle that “public office is a public trust” does not hold for the President and the First Family. Of course we all need to be particular about the source of the funds. That is the most important issue (but, significantly, not the only one). The distinction between the private person and the public official is a measure of political modernity; we no longer make the mistake of thinking that the office is the man. If President Marcos incurs an expense in his private capacity – for instance, buying a ticket to an Eric Clapton concert, or indulging an addiction to nicotine – he must pay for it out of his own pocket. That’s what his salary is for; that’s where his family’s private wealth, the subject of unending litigation, comes in. To say, blithely, as Bersamin did, that the source of funding is “irrelevant,” is to do violence to the constitutional principle of accountability. Bersamin suggested that even he could have paid for the President’s travel, if only he had the money, and it would have been okay. Again, arrant and dangerous nonsense.  If, to follow his own example, he did pay for the President’s trip, then he should be ready to stand accused of buying his new position. Private time. Bersamin’s second rationalization was that the President was on “private time.” He said: “It’s not immodest, it’s not contrary to morals, private time ‘yan.” He was preemptively answering possible ethical questions that could be raised against the President based on principles enshrined in the Constitution and the laws, but he was only indulging in a non-sequitur. Just because an official does something on private time, it doesn’t mean that what he does is necessarily modest, or not contrary to morals. “Private time” doesn’t cover a multitude of sins. And even if, to borrow Bersamin’s own strained metaphor, Marcos Junior had become a “matinee idol” whose very presence at the race added “some suspense and intrigue and some importance to that event,” that new-found celebrity still would not protect the President if he were to commit a crime or a scandal during his own private time. But in fact Bersamin used the private time argument in bad faith, because he had a third rationalization that ran opposite the second. The President, the former justice said, “was still performing his job as President when he was abroad, although that is not an official state visit.” It is easy enough to see how vapid this reasoning is, when you apply it to actual and specific examples. When Marcos watched the Clapton concert, was he still performing his job as President? When he spent hours soaking in the expensive atmosphere of an F1 race, was he doing so as part of his presidential duties? Questions like these are why Bersamin offered the private time argument, but as chief aide he thought it was necessary to add the exact opposite argument, just to cover all the bases. What a disgrace. But he didn’t stop there. To try to deflect public outrage over the President’s insensitive partying in Singapore, at a time when many had not yet recovered from the last typhoon, Bersamin said it was the criticism of the President’s visit that was insensitive. “Yun ang insensitive, yung criticism.” When an avatar of the rule of law is the first to attack the public’s inherent right to criticize erring public officials, he has lost his bearings and has no business serving in government. The irony is that he even thought his own person could serve as the clincher to the argument that the source of funding was irrelevant. But it didn’t – because there was nothing there.",0
5,John Nery,"In 'Some People Need Killing,' the acclaimed journalist's searing, searching account of Rodrigo Duterte’s calamitous 'war on drugs,' we come face to face with the enormity of evil – and the language that enables it. Rodrigo Duterte was the only candidate for Philippine president who promised to kill thousands of his potential voters to solve what he called a drug crisis; he would fill Manila Bay with the corpses of as many as a hundred thousand drug addicts, he said. Once voted into office, he made good on that promise. Some People Need Killing, the journalist Patricia Evangelista’s much-anticipated account of Duterte’s promised war on drugs, includes in its breadth of detail and casualty count and dramatic incident some of those very Duterte voters who ended up killed in Duterte’s war. There is even an entire chapter on Duterte supporters consumed by regret. This may have been an effort on Evangelista’s part to end her harrowing, thoughtful, absorbing account on a less bleak note, but she is above all else a reporter, and her faithful reporting does not sugarcoat reality. Thousands of extrajudicial killings had changed the country irrevocably. A nation of martyrs has become a country of killers. Some of the early vigilantes called it right. We are Duterte, they said. Evangelista’s account is a memoir of her coverage of the EJKs and what led her to it (it is subtitled “A Memoir of Murder in My Country”); but it is also reportage, some new and some already published but expanded, filled with even more detail and drawn with more context, all of it reworked into a whole; it is, lastly, an analysis, of how a democracy can die. Much of that analysis reflects a writer’s sensibility. Evangelista, in the field, looks for the telling detail or the outrageous fact; at her writing table, she looks for the enabling word, the language that kills. In this review’s lead paragraph, for instance, she will likely seize on the idiomatic irony of “making good on” a promise of evil, and write a thoughtful paragraph or page on how ostensibly moral phrasing can subvert morality. Since her twenties, Evangelista has had a reputation for beautiful writing. (It isn’t true, as she asserts in a self-effacing passage, that she was hired to write a column by the Philippine Daily Inquirer only because of her youth.) Her stories from the war on drugs, especially those in Part II, will add to that reputation. “Marcelo worked as a truck driver’s assistant. He lived, with his partner and three children, in a house just a few feet from the shanty where his mother had given birth to him thirty-one years earlier. Unlike many of the Payatas settlements, the Daa home sat in a remote clearing, requiring a long walk downhill from the main highway, through a patch of woods where the thick canopy of trees did little to mask the stench of the nearby dump site. The Daas lived in a lonely huddle of squat houses pieced together from tarps and plywood, their tin roofs weighed down by large rocks and washbasins and a chipped Blue’s Clues doorstop lying on its side. A sixty-foot ravine curved around the edges.” Comparing this paragraph with the original and already fine description, in the Rappler series in which it appeared, the reader can see that the phrasing has tightened, even though more detail had been added. And the reworking of that last sentence, cutting it just so, reflects and raises the tension in that story. But her account also includes passages like these (this one is on “salvage” in Philippine English): “Salvage-as-murder does not exist in most Filipino dictionaries. Nor does the definition appear in the many English-Filipino compendiums that are available for academic use. But every child in my country knows this meaning …. A salvage yard is not a fenced-in path of concrete with secondhand cars and vintage lamps for thrifting. A salvage yard is a street corner in Tondo, or the right lane of an overpass at dawn. A salvage yard is a cemetery, unless there is no one to give the dead man a name.” It is this attention to both detail and diction that sets Evangelista’s work apart. Doing the inconceivable. “I spent much of my time sorting through the convoluted grammar of official police reports,” she writes, in another characteristically self-deprecating self-description. But out of this basic step, Police Beat Reporting 101, she captures the accidental anti-poetry of bureaucratic language, which makes the inconceivable doable. For instance: “Cops [in a buy-bust operation] use the same word for fulfillment as is used for newlyweds: consummation. ‘After the consummated transaction,’ read one police report, ‘poseur-buyer and companion arrested the suspect.’” Another instance: “In the black-and-white of a Philippine spot report, ‘suspect sensed presence of lawmen’ comes just before ‘suspect drew his firearm’.” On August 15, 2017, in what became colloquially known as a One Time Big Time operation, 32 persons were killed in one province alone. At least eight spot reports filed by the police struck a variation of the same theme of presence sensed. Evangelista quotes the reports, and presents them one after the other. “At 12.20 a.m., suspects Bernard Lizardo and Justine Bucacao, ‘after sensing that they were dealing with an undercover police poseur’ …. At 12.40 a.m., suspects Jimmy Gorgon and Bartolome Marin ‘sensed the presence of operatives’.” And so on, until 4.30 am. The cumulative effect is both hilarious and horrifying. And yet another instance: “There is a phrase that has been used whenever police officers sit down to brag about their prowess in the field. It is also a phrase that appears in a certain species of police report …. The suspect is discovered dead, or almost dead, but that discovery occurs only after ‘the smoke of gunfire subsides.’ In Binondo … ‘after the smoke of gun battle subsided’ two suspects were ‘seen sprawled lifeless inside the rooms of the small house.’ In Santa Cruz, ‘when the smoke of gunfire subsided,’ police reported the subject ‘lay in the cemented pavement mortally wounded’. The same is true for a man in Tondo, found dead just after ‘the smoke of gunfire subsided,’ and in Jose Abad Santos, where another subject was found lying on another cemented pavement dead of gunshot wounds—‘after the smoke of gunfire subsided’.” Duterte, more rambling than a police report but with straighter grammar, comes under the same scrutiny. Evangelista’s “sorting” of the President’s speech is a series of compelling compilations, a Greatest Hits collection, of violent rhetoric. She recounts what amounts to Duterte’s origin story, as the man with the iron hand (she carefully indicates, in one of her fastidious endnotes, that Duterte had related this story at least six times). It involves his encounter as a new mayor of Davao City with the unrepentant rapist of an 18-month-old baby. The rapist, asked why he did it, gave a truly monstrous answer. “If that’s the answer you get,” Duterte asked, “what will you do?” But he never did say exactly what he did to the rapist. Just that “I did do something,” with a new revolver he had received for Christmas. Don’t blame him, the President said, “if I am driven also to insanity.” In another 11 speeches, Duterte claimed that 77,000 people had died in the hands of drug addicts in the three to four years before his election. “You know, in the wake of the drug contamination in the Philippines, 77,000 deaths, drug-related. Who will answer for that? Who will take the cudgels for those innocent—the young women raped? The ones held up in jeepneys—who will answer for them?” (Evangelista quickly and completely debunks Duterte’s mistaken statistics.) But the point of all the alleged numbers was dehumanization: “A lot of them are no longer viable as human beings in this planet,” he said. In another seven speeches, at least, “His Excellency Rodrigo Duterte, commander in chief, ordered his own men to violate not just the spirit but the letter of the law.” Shoot the suspect, he said, or hinted at it – and he said it again and again, in Davao City, in Davao again but in another venue, in Clark Freeport, in Marawi City, again in Davao, in Quezon City, in the presidential palace. Language as an enabler. In a particularly provocative passage that runs over four pages, Evangelista questions her own translation of the Filipino word for “beautiful,” in posting about Duterte’s monstrous response to the One Time Big Time operation in Bulacan province, which killed 32 suspects in one night. Of the death toll, the President had said, “Maganda yun.” In her social media, Evangelista posted her translation of the President’s words: “That’s good.” In Some People Need Killing, Evangelista writes: “In Filipino, maganda means ‘beautiful.’ It can also mean ‘good.’ It was unclear what the President meant that afternoon in August, but there was a reason every English-language local news organization chose to use the word good instead of beautiful. Good, as egregious a judgment as it was, was far less outrageous than beautiful. Beautiful would have offered an element of pleasure, a romanticizing of brutality, the impression that the commander in chief of a democratic republic  was not just pleased but delighted by the ruthless killing of his citizens.” What follows is an extraordinary list of the many things that Duterte had called beautiful in public. Perhaps nothing catches both Duterte’s appeal as a leader and the anomaly of his leadership so accurately – and yes, even beautifully – as the list Evangelista put together. It includes the President’s older girlfriend (“more beautiful than the other one”), his sidearm, Melania Trump, his circumcised penis, bodies that “only had one bullet hole in each head” – and yes, 32 suspects killed in one night. If those are the answers you get, what will you do? Evangelista suggests we must pay attention to the normalization of abusive or violent language, because it can quickly become the rhetoric of authoritarian return. Several stories stand out in Evangelista’s account: The fifth man, the tragedy of Heart de Chavez, the bizarre police friend, the slapping of Djastin with a D. The build-up to her one encounter with the vigilante leader known familiarly as Commander Maning is well-paced and thrilling (and differs markedly from the original Rappler series). Only the second chapter seemed to me to be weak; Philippine history was painted with too broad a brush. But I counted 11 instances when her stories, or her writing, stopped me momentarily – and the first of these, a revelation about her grandfather, was in that second chapter. Another passage that stopped me: Her disquisition on the transformation of the word “laban” or fight, associated with the opposition leader Ninoy Aquino, to “nanlaban,” or fought back, now forever part of the enabling language of the war on drugs. She also provides checklists, of a sort. For the aspiring journalist, two pages worth. For the aspiring vigilante, three. The enormity of evil requires more space.

6,Iris Gonzales,"Inside Bangladesh, it’s called the Gen Z revolution as young students from Dhaka University began protesting last month to demand an end to the government’s jobs quota system.

The system, according to a CNN report on the Bangladesh crisis, reserves 30 percent of civil service posts for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.

“Many of the country’s contemporary political elite are related to that generation – including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.”

Following days of protests which had turned bloody, the 76-year-old Prime Minister Hasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter to India.

Hasina’s sudden exit ends 15 years in power, which were marred by dissent because her government, according to critics and human rights organizations, stifled civil liberties.

Amid joblessness, high inflation in the post-pandemic era and the growing curtailment of freedom, protestors demanded change.

Ironically, Hasina led a democratic uprising against military rule in 1990. Now she has found herself in the same situation but at the other end of the uprising.

It was a long time coming. It was not a revolution that happened overnight.

Prior to the July 1 protest, critics and human rights organizations have already expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, harassment of the media and opposition figures, crackdown on freedom of expression online as well as arbitrary detention and torture in Bangladesh.

Tipping point
This was not the first time that protests hounded Hasina’s government even as she managed to survive previous demonstrations.

The recent protests, however, were different as police shot and killed the young dissidents in full view of their peers.

This seemed to be the tipping point. Protestors could no longer be stopped, not even by the threat of being killed by security forces.

“Driving the anger was high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it slowed in the post-pandemic era and is beset with high inflation and depleted foreign currency reserves. In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education,” according to CNN.

This could be the first major successful Gen Z revolution in world history, said Sabrina Karim, associate professor of government at Cornell University, who specializes in the study of political violence, as quoted by CNN.

People Power I
The Philippines is no stranger to uprisings.

In 1986, we inspired the world with the historic bloodless People Power revolt which toppled Ferdinand Marcos Sr.

Whether in the Philippines or in Bangladesh, however, the challenge is how to protect the freedoms we’ve fought for and successfully won.

The challenge is to fulfill that promise of change that protests and revolutions strived to usher in.

Leaders of change must make sure that they are indeed capable of becoming the change they want to see in their country; that they wouldn’t just turn into the next monster or ogre they successfully slayed and that they wouldn’t end up being corrupted by the system they vehemently opposed and tried to change.

Otherwise, it will just be a cycle of boom and bust; of authoritarian rule and revolutions; of protests and military rule or, in our case, of yellows and reds; of Marcos and Aquinos; or of Marcos and Dutertes.

Look what happened to us. We toppled a dictator and showed the world how it was done only to elect another Marcos into power more than three decades later.

Ironically, some of those who protested against then president Marcos Sr. back then are now part of the government of President Marcos Jr.

One cannot blame them, however. Or the masses. Perhaps for them, nothing really changed after the 1986 People Power Revolution.

We are unique in this sense because it seems we never really learn our lessons. History just keeps repeating itself, no matter how absurd a cycle that is.

One culprit I see here is corruption.

Corruption has been around for thousands of years. Shakespeare’s plays showed vignettes of corruption, while Dante supposedly placed bribers in the deepest parts of Hell, according to the International Monetary Fund’s working paper on corruption published in 1998.

And yet, it doesn’t seem to end.

After a new candidate or a new system is in place, the initial jubilation soon fades as constituents realize that the same old system or the same old trapo is back.

In the Philippines, it’s even getting worse, especially in local government units where corruption has become so deeply entrenched.

Pay offs or grease money have gone up by 30 to 50 percent, attest some businessmen; some local chieftains even offer “bespoke pay-offs packages” to entrepreneurs who want to set up shop in their locality, depending on their capacity to pay and their needs.

Local chieftains, like lawmakers, also have their own contractors which they require businessmen to hire.

Anti-corruption bodies, including the Anti-Red Tape Authority, must look into these reports to eradicate corruption in the different branches of our government.

Revolutions can only lead to lasting changes if they topple not just flawed leaders but corrupt systems as well.

This is a lesson that Gen Z Bangladeshis must also keep in mind now that they have removed their leader from power.

Otherwise, it’s just going to be the same old story.",0
7,Iris Gonzales,"Curtains close. Kisses stop. Love stories end.

Indeed, some things in life are fleeting and ephemeral. That’s just the way it is. There’s even an old adage that says all good things come to an end.

Once in a while, however, life surprises us with something so great that it lingers and lives on in our hearts. Forever.

Such is the music of the legendary rock band Eraserheads, the kind that resonated – and continues to resonate – with generations and generations of Filipinos. Their songs were always someone's anthem and gospel truth; inspiration or palliative; a curse even but always an impetus to move and act.

It’s no surprise therefore that on Tuesday, Aug. 20, members of the band – Marcus Adoro, Ely Buendia, Raimund Marasigan and Buddy Zabala – returned to their Alma Mater, the University of the Philippines, to receive the prestigious Gawad Oblation Award, the highest distinction that the university can bestow.

Says UP president Angelo Jimenez in his welcome remarks: “The Gawad Oblation is a symbol of our deep gratitude for that extraordinary service rendered with or in our name. In the name of UP.”

It’s no exaggeration, he adds, that the Eraserheads “are a pivotal force in the history of original Pilipino music.”

“The Eraserheads helped define the music, memories and identity of a generation, no less.”

They also humanized a generation during a very very divisive period in the history of our country by asserting individuality, president Jimenez also says.

For the band members who all studied in UP Diliman, it was a full circle moment of sorts. The university, they said, was the foundation for their voice, art and music.

In their acceptance speeches, the Eraserheads said it was in UP where they tasted and experienced real freedom. “Kalayaan pumili at maghayag, kalayaan sundin at kalayaan pakingan ang sariling himig,” said Marcus.

Raimund thanked his parents who supported him even if he didn’t get to bring home a diploma, drawing laughter from the crowd. Buddy, too, thanked those who supported the band throughout their journey.

Ely recalled how music saved him from a sure failing grade in Spanish. “Singko,” says the Eheads vocalist in an exaggerated Spanish accent, drawing more laughter from the crowd.

“I begged my professor for a passing grade. And he asked me: Do you have anything that would make me consider passing you? Anything at all?

Ely told his professor:

Well I can write a song and so I gave him a demo cassette of Pare ko and prayed.

The next day, to his pleasant surprise, his professor in Spanish told him that he passed.

This experience taught Ely two things.

“One is that my professor could understand Tagalog and that two, from that point on, that music can get me through anything in life.”

A year later in Kalayaan, Ely found three people who also had his struggles and shared his dream.

The rest, as they say, is history.

For the crowd that descended into the glittering Executive House for the Gawad Oblation awarding ceremony, it was a great honor and delight to bear witness to such a momentous occasion.

President Jimenez invited me to cover the event but there at that moment, I could barely cover. I was just taking it all in with wide-eyed awe and a full heart, listening, as a huge fan, to their story.

For how could I not? It was a band that accompanied my generation in the murky years of our lives – from teenage to adulthood, those years of first loves and first heartbreaks, first defeats and first triumphs.

But for the first time, I was not watching them perform. I was listening to their stories about their UP days.

What they said about UP being a bastion of freedom and an abode to find your voice and pursue your passion is perhaps true for every UP student and alumni.

Most Distinguished Alumnus
Days before, in a separate but equally festive awarding ceremony for the UP Alumni Association awardees, tycoon Isidro “Sid” Consunji shared a similar story as a student after he was hailed as this year’s Most Distinguished Alumnus of UP.

Sid described himself as an ordinary engineering student but highlighted the fact that he also learned a lot from the time he spent in UP – outside its classrooms.

“I spent more time outside the classroom than inside, being active in Beta Epsilon Fraternity and the Association of Civil Engineering Students,” said the DMCI Holdings chairman who led this year’s roster of distinguished awardees.

I, too, was at the UPAA event, together with my family as we received the Multigenerational Alumni Family Award given to us.

On the sidelines of the event, Sid or IAC, as he is known in the business community, asked me where I get my inspiration to write my stories. In jest, I pointed to the Macallan on his table, saying it’s my poison and inspiration.

But in reality, as I stood there at both awarding ceremonies, I was reminded of the fact that its in UP indeed where I really learned to dream and pursue the things that inspire me.

As Ely Buendia said, “UP shaped not only our minds but also our souls.”

And from the others who came before us, our professors and fellow alumni included, we found the courage to carry on.

The Eraserheads and their songs, for instance, are vivid reminders of making it from one point to the next, of surviving the hardest of times and eventually thriving with a smile.",0
8,Iris Gonzales,"The Marcos administration can’t pop the champagne just yet even as Filipinos cheered the President’s big pronouncement during his State of the Nation Address, ordering a total ban on the Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs).

Now, his administration needs to do a lot of cleaning up and serious work as part of the post-POGO exit plan.

For one, the government would have to make up for the losses in revenue and business activities from the POGO exit – however insignificant our authorities deem this to be.

Economic managers said the costs of POGO far outweigh the benefits. Still, our taxman would need to find alternative sources of revenue to make up for what would be lost from the POGO industry’s exit from the country.

This is especially urgent with slower fiscal consolidation hounding the Marcos administration now and in the years to come.

Revenue
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), for instance, is now looking at taxing online sellers to raise additional revenue. According to its plan, merchants or sellers in online platforms are now subject to withholding tax effective last month.

BIR’s Revenue Regulation 16-2023 states that one-half of the gross remittances of e-marketplace operations and digital financial services providers to the sellers or merchants for goods or services shall now be subject to a one percent creditable withholding tax.

BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. stresses that this is not a new tax but merely including the sector in the withholding tax system.

It’s not yet clear how much the BIR expects to collect from this sector but with the proliferation of online sellers, it must be significant.

Will this make up for the taxes collected from POGOs? We’ll have to wait and see.

Taxes collected from POGOs more than doubled to almost P10.3 billion last year although still below the expected P32 billion when the Duterte administration passed the POGO Law in 2021.

From January to May this year, BIR data showed that taxes from POGOs already reached P14 billion – consisting of income, franchise, withholding, documentary and other taxes. This does not yet included license fees and share of the government in gaming revenues.

Will the BIR’s plan to tax online merchants yield billions in taxes, too? As I said, we’ll have to wait and see.

Additionally, the government would have to find new sources to plug the revenue losses that would inevitably appear in the trail of the POGO exit if only to fully realize the benefits of banning the industry.

Office market
Colliers also said the POGO ban is expected to push office vacancy rate to 22 percent by the end of the year from 19.3 percent in 2023. That’s a breach of the 20 percent level.

Thus, Colliers said real estate owners should make strategic adjustments to spaces previously tenanted by POGOs to cushion the impact of the industry’s exit from Metro Manila’s office market.

Colliers said POGOs occupied about 489,000 square meters of office space in Metro Manila as of end-June, or about 3.5 percent of the total office stock, as The STAR’s Richmond Mercurio reported last week.

In the office market universe, this is not that huge, considering that it represents only 3.5 percent of the inventory but whether we like it or not, this would still be significant enough to influence rental rates and related businesses.

Against this backdrop, Colliers said landlords, particularly those with high exposure to POGO tenants, should consider implementing various strategic adjustments.

“These include providing commercial concessions such as lower base rents, tenant improvement allowances and rent-free fit-out periods to make space more marketable to clients,” Colliers said.

“These include providing commercial concessions such as lower base rents, tenant improvement allowances and rent-free fit-out periods to make space more marketable to clients,” Colliers said.

Indirect benefits
There are other indirect benefits derived from the POGO sector, as the Department of Finance pointed out. These include compensation to laborers whose disposable income is spent on goods and services that generate economic activities.

DOF estimates the direct and indirect benefits of POGOs amount to roughly P166.49 billion a year.

But as reported by our public finance reporter Louise Maureen Simeon, the DOF’s cost-benefit analysis shows that the costs of POGOs are higher at P265.7 billion.

A huge part of this comes from supposed foregone revenues from investments and tourism due to the negative picture associated with criminal activities of illegal POGOs.

And this is where the Marcos administration needs to do a lot of cleaning up.

Simply banning POGOs does not necessarily mean that criminals and syndicates operating in the Philippines’ labyrinthine underworld will disappear or retire.

Our authorities must seriously investigate and bring to justice perpetrators of money laundering, peddlers of fake birth certificates and possibly, human traffickers. Otherwise such harmful and unspeakable acts will continue to hound us even after the POGO ban.

As what usually happens, syndicates behind organized crime may just lie low for a while until the spotlight dims; they would then reinvent themselves when the dust clears and continue perpetrating their crimes.

More importantly, authorities must keep an eye on illegal operators after the ban. E-sabong, jueteng and other similar activities have long been banned but have they really been fully eradicated?

Industry sources say otherwise.

Thus, authorities must pursue cases against perpetrators of crimes and their coddlers in high places.

Along with these efforts, the government must rid itself of bureaucratic red tape and corruption.

Only then can we send a message to legitimate investors that the Philippines is now a safe and friendly place to do business.

9,Iris Gonzales,"My late grandfather Jorge A. Gonzales, an outstanding individual who lived through World War II, put up a small fleet of jeepneys which served the route between Cubao and the University of the Philippines-Diliman campus.

He did this to help students coming from the Cubao area get to their classes on time.

My grandfather was a UP alumnus so he knew the need for transportation to and from the sprawling campus. When he graduated from the UP College of Law, he went on to practice law but at the same time, put up small businesses, including a barbershop and that fleet of jeepneys.

It complemented the UP Ikot route, which in turn was put up by the pioneer of the UP Ikot, Lolo Neong Odoy, so that students don’t have to walk long distances in between colleges in the 493-hectare campus.

This was during the postbellum era of the late 40s and early 50s, a time of rebuilding and recovering, of standing and helping each other rise from the devastating and paralyzing effects of the Second World War.

Back then, the jeepneys served the citizens well. The jeeps were a surplus from wartime and were sold and resold when the Americans left, paving the way for cheap public transportation for Filipinos.

Fast forward to today and we’re now on the way to phasing out jeepneys.

Is it a wise move?
Perhaps even my grandfather would agree that the jeepney, while it was fit for our roads during the postwar era and in the few decades after, is no longer the best public transportation we can offer Filipino commuters in this day and age. These 5,000-kilogram machines have become outmoded, what with all the changes that came with the times.

Our roads have become too crowded for the jeepneys and our streets too polluted for commuters to endure long rides in an open and exposed vehicle such as the jeepney.

As we develop, we really should provide Filipino commuters better but still affordable mobility options. These include other types of vehicles.

Had the government supported the jeepney manufacturers early on, we wouldn’t be taking this long to modernize our jeepneys. They could have evolved into producers of other types of vehicles under a brand that is truly Filipino. They could have updated the jeepneys to fit with the changing times. But they were always on their own.

But that’s water under the bridge now.

At present, the focus is to push through with PUV modernization.

I believe it’s about time this happens but of course it should not come at the expense of the drivers and other stakeholders who rely on the jeepneys to earn a living.

Transportation Secretary Jaime “JJB” Bautista has submitted a 100-page letter to Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero regarding the suspension of the Public Transportation Modernization Program (PTMP).

This came after senators said they would push for the suspension of the program.

Responding to the different points raised against the program, Sec. JJB stressed that the PTMP does not require PUV operators and drivers to immediately purchase modern PUVs upon consolidation. Instead, PUV modernization will occur gradually over the next three to four years after the consolidation deadline.

“We also want to assure the Senate committee that PNS and greenhouse gas emission-compliant modern jeepney units available on the market are not limited to foreign and imported manufacturers. In fact, modern jeepney units are also produced by well-known local manufacturers,” Bautista said in his letter dated July 29, 2024.

“The DOTr also remains committed to preserving the iconic design of our traditional jeepneys and encourages all local manufacturers and importers of PUVs to emulate the artistic design of traditional PUJs,” he also said.

This measure, Sec. Bautista said, aims to preserve the country’s cultural heritage while adhering to the relevant enforceable PNS or Philippine National Standards.

In his letter, the DOTr chief also warned of the potential effects of suspending PTMP as follows:

• Stakeholder impact. Suspending PTMP at this stage of its implementation could disrupt services for many who depend on its benefits. This could undermine progress and damage relationships with stakeholders, particularly, given that a significant percentage thereof have already consolidated.

• Resource utilization. Further, significant resources have already been invested in developing and implementing the PTMP.

In 2024 alone, the government has already appropriated the amount of P1.6 billion for the program. As it was furthered by the (Senate) committee, the program’s utilization rate is already at 53 percent of the P7.5-billion budget from 2018 to 2024. Suspending the program now risks wasting these investments and incurring additional costs to reestablish similar initiatives in the future.

As of April 30, 2024, the franchise consolidation process has reached 83.38 percent with 159,862 out of the 1919,730 baseline units consolidated. In total, there are 6,090 consolidated routes for PUJs, UVEs (UV Express), minibuses and PUBs (public utility buses), data from DOTr also showed.

Ways forward
In conclusion, Sec. JJB said, “We respectfully beseech the Honorable Senate to consider the ongoing benefits and improvements of PTMP. A temporary suspension might not only halt the positive momentum of the program, but could also have unintended negative consequences.”

Every paradigm shift has its challenges. Not everyone will be happy but the goal is for the changes to benefit the majority and more importantly, for the benefits to outweigh the drawbacks.

What happens next remains to be seen.",0
10,Iris Gonzales,"It’s a day celebrated not just in Japan but in different parts of the world, hosted by Japanese embassies across the globe.

But here in our country, the celebration of the birthday of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan is always extra special because it combines the best of Japanese hospitality and the warmth of the Filipino, not to mention the gastronomic delight of traditional Japanese cuisine and good servings of polished sake, often prepared together by Japanese and Filipino chefs.

Friday night at the Ty-owned Grand Hyatt Manila was no exception as Ambassador Koshikawa Kazuhiko hosted the annual National Day Reception to celebrate the 64th birthday of His Majesty the Emperor.

Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin graced the event and led the toast in honor of “the health of His Majesty the Emperor, the continued peace and prosperity of the Japanese people and the lasting friendship between the Philippines and Japan.”

It was indeed an evening of friendship, with government officials, lawmakers, tycoons and friends of the Japanese embassy in Manila descending into the glittering ballroom of Grand Hyatt in Taguig, some as early as the sun set in the city.

It was a fitting venue to celebrate a milestone for Japan because, as we all know, the Ty Group has been consistently instrumental in strengthening our country’s ties with Japan through its partnerships with some of the sogo shoshas from the so-called Land of the Rising Sun.

Not surprisingly, the Ty brothers, Arthur and Alfred, dapper in their suits, were there that evening; you can be sure it’s really an important event when Arthur, who isn’t usually seen in big crowds, makes a rare public appearance.

In his speech, Amb. Koshikawa reflected on the dramatic growth of Japan-Philippine relations. He lauded the mutual visit of President Marcos to Japan and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s visit to the Philippines in 2023, emphasizing the significance of these actions in reaffirming friendly relations between the two countries and setting a course for the future.

Economic cooperation
The evening wouldn’t be complete without talking about economic cooperation, and Amb. Koshikawa did just that as he underscored Japan’s commitment to strong economic ties with the Philippines.

A testament to this, he said, are the Japan-backed important infrastructure projects such as the Metro Manila Subway, the North-South Commuter Railway, the Davao Bypass, as well as the Mindanao peace process.

He also raised the importance of security cooperation, mentioning the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) that is under negotiation between Japan and the Philippines and the Official Security Assistance (OSA). RAA is aimed at facilitating cooperation between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Japan Self-Defense Force while OSA is for the provision of coastal radar systems.

Hello Ja-Fun!
Amb. Koshikawa also happily reported that because of a post-pandemic resurgence of tourism, the number of Filipinos going to Japan reached a record high last year.

There were 622,268 Filipinos who went to Japan, exceeding the pre-pandemic figures of 613,114 recorded in 2019, according to data from the Japan National Tourism Organization.

VIPs who filled the stage for the toast included House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Charles John Brown.

Also spotted that night were former prime minister Cesar Virata, Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity Carlito Galvez and members of the diplomatic community.

Tycoons, businessmen and executives also took time out of their busy schedules to join the festivities. Aside from the Ty brothers, I also saw Cecilio Pedro, founder of Lamoiyan Corp., the company behind the popular Hapee toothpaste brand; Edgard Cabangon, chairman of ALC Group of Companies and Yoji Kawaguchi, president of Mitsukoshi Federal Retail Inc.

New Toyota Philippines prexy
Just as I was chatting with Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP) chairman Alfred Ty, whom I congratulated for Grand Hyatt’s successful hosting of the event that night and the official turnover of the TMP presidency, newly appointed TMP president Masando Hashimoto walks by.

At last, I had the opportunity to finally congratulate Hashimoto because I wasn’t able to talk to him during the turnover ceremony held in the same glittering ballroom just a few days ago.

Hashimoto assumed leadership from Atsuhiro Okamato, who in turn, described his tenure in the Philippines as his most memorable, what with the Pinatubo eruption and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Going back to the Friday’s Japan National Day celebration, there were many other notable guests but one who stood out was the indefatigable and energetic Ramon S. Ang or RSA who arrived just as the program was about to start.

In no time, RSA was swarmed by well-wishers – including a rival bidder – congratulating him for his recent victory in the Ninoy Aquino International Airport bidding.

But it was not only his NAIA win that earned him praises, but also for Gilas Pilipinas’ landslide win against Hong Kong in the recent FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers.

That night, everyone wanted a minute of RSA’s time and he gave it. He was really visibly happy with what seems to be an alignment of stars for San Miguel Corp., the diversified conglomerate that he leads.

Overall, Japan’s National Day reception in the Philippines was a lovely evening not just to celebrate the oldest monarchy in the world, but to mark the good friendship it has built with other countries, including ours, through the years.

I, too, offer my warmest felicitations to Japan on its special day.",0
11,Maria A. Ressa,"Those with power and money must choose. Ask yourselves these questions: Who are you? What do you stand for? What kind of world do you want in the next decade?'
The following speech was delivered by Rappler CEO Maria Ressa on Sunday, May 2, after receiving the 2021 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.

Thank you so much to UNESCO, the independent jury, the more than 80 press freedom and news organizations who have helped us hold the line. This is for Rappler and all Filipino journalists who – despite the increased risks just to be able to do our jobs – continue to hold power to account. It’s also a reflection of how the world looks at the Duterte administration today and the death by a thousand cuts of our democracy happening in front of our eyes.

I wish I were with you today in Namibia, but I’m in Manila, prevented from traveling by court order – which I continue to fight as State-led legal attacks are waged against me on multiple fronts. I also can’t travel because my nation is suffering the consequences of putting retired military generals in charge of a public health crisis – when political patronage and loyalty, not competence, is the metric of power.

This is a time when lies and incompetence kill.

In less than two years, the Philippine government filed 10 arrest warrants against me.

In 2017, government propagandists tried to trend the hashtag #ArrestMariaRessa. They failed, but they kept at it, and two years later, I was arrested – twice – in a little more than a month. They violated my rights when they prevented me from posting bail and detained me overnight. I suppose they wanted me to shake and feel their power.

To the budding dictators of this world, if you have to abuse your power to make you feel powerful, you’re not powerful – just abusive and small.

What I and other truth-tellers in the Philippines have lived through has given us firsthand experience of how the law and law enforcement have been turned against our people. Now more than ever, power and money rule.

In 2016, 4 months after Duterte became president, Rappler and I wrote investigative pieces showing you how the first casualty in our nation’s battle for truth is the number of people killed in our brutal drug war. That violence was facilitated and fueled by American social media companies. Based on big data analysis, we reported the networks that were manipulating us online, targeting and attacking truth-tellers, pounding to silence anyone challenging power, which created an extensive social media propaganda machine.

Five years ago, we demanded an end to impunity on two fronts: Duterte’s drug war and Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook. Today, it has only gotten worse – and Silicon Valley’s sins came home to roost on January 6 with mob violence on Capitol Hill.

What happens on social media doesn’t stay on social media.

Online violence leads to real world violence.

Since 2016, I have felt like Sisyphus and Cassandra combined, repeatedly warning that our dystopian present is your future. American biologist EO Wilson said it best: we’re facing paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology.

Social media, with its highly profitable micro targeting, has become a behavior modification system, and we are Pavlov’s dogs experimented on in real time – with disastrous consequences. Facebook is the world’s largest distributor of news, and yet studies have shown that lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and further than really boring facts. The social media platforms that deliver the facts to you are biased against facts, biased against journalists, biased against meaningful conversations. They are – by design – dividing us and radicalizing us. This is not a free speech issue. It’s not the fault of its users. These platforms are not merely mirroring humanity. They are making all of us our worst selves, creating emergent behavior that feeds on violence, fear, uncertainty, and enabling the rise of fascism.

Think of it like this.

Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without trust, we have no shared reality, and it becomes impossible to deal with our world’s existential problems: the coronavirus, climate, the atom bomb that exploded in our information ecosystem when journalists lost gatekeeping powers to technology companies. Tech abdicated responsibility for the public sphere and couldn’t seem to fathom that information is a public good.

Women, people of color, the LGBTQ, those already marginalized become even more vulnerable as you’ll see in the UNESCO report “The Chilling” whose lead author, ICFJ’s Julie Posetti, convinced me to speak up when my attacks began many years ago. Of course, there’s a cost to speaking truth to power.

On Christmas Eve two years ago, Amal Clooney sent me an email. Until then, no one had really had the time to go through the many ludicrous charges I’m facing and their penalties. Turns out I could go to jail for the rest of my life. By her last count – on paper – it was more than a hundred years in prison. So I dealt with the sinking feeling in my stomach – this is my lawyer telling me that, right? I took away a lesson: don’t open an email from Amal on Christmas Eve! Sometimes you just have to laugh.

Believe it or not, I’m lucky. When you’re the target of attacks you’re the only one who sees it all, but you can also see exactly how the tactics change. Knowledge is power. And because I spent two decades of my career outside the Philippines, the international community knows me, the quality of my work, my values, my work ethic.

So many others aren’t so lucky.

Like 35-year-old Ritchie Nepomuceno, who accused the police of extortion, torture, and rape. She was one of at least 3 Filipino women who filed charges against 11 policemen who they said held them inside a secret room at a police station. Less than two weeks ago on April 19, Ritchie was walking down the street when she was shot and killed.

Human rights activist Zara Alvarez and another colleague were set to testify against the government and the military. She went as far as asking for court protection, which was at first denied, and is still on appeal. Last August, she was walking home with her dinner – she had just bought it – when she was shot and killed. So was her colleague. No one is left to testify. I could go on.

Now let’s go to the journalists.

Frenchie Mae Cumpio, still in jail, celebrated her 22nd birthday in prison. Arrested and jailed more than a year ago, it is a familiar tactic: get an arrest warrant; do a raid; then charge with possession of illegal firearms and explosives, a non-bailable offense.

That’s also what happened to Lady Ann Salem, another young journalist. Arrested last December, Salem said the police planted evidence in her apartment, but another judge voided her arrest warrant. It still took time before she was released, forcing her to spend 3 months in prison during a pandemic. 

Because she’s a journalist.

It’s not a coincidence that these victims are women. This February, Senator Leila de Lima, whom Amnesty International calls a prisoner of conscience, began her 5th year in prison. She calls it lawfare – when law is used as a weapon to silence anyone questioning power. The cuts to democracy are bleeding. They’re overwhelming and can’t be ignored.

Last year, two days, just two days after World Press Freedom Day, Filipino lawmakers, nudged by President Duterte, shut down ABS-CBN, once our largest broadcasting network, our largest news group, also headed by a female journalist. Thousands lost their jobs.

Around the same time that Hong Kong passed its draconian security law, the Philippines passed an anti-terror law that sparked 37 petitions at the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional. Under that law, anyone some Cabinet secretaries call a terrorist could be arrested without a warrant and jailed for up to 24 days. Here’s one last fact: more lawyers have died under the Duterte administration than in the 44 years before he took office.

So here’s the thing: our problems can’t be solved from the Philippines alone. Again, something I’ve said repeatedly: what’s local is global; and what’s global is local.

As we face the coronavirus, there’s an equally dangerous and insidious virus of lies unleashed in our information ecosystem. It’s seeded by power wanting to stay in power, spread by algorithms motivated, created for profit, a business model Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. The reward is your attention, and all this is linked to geopolitical power play. Last week, the EU slammed Russia and China for their intensified vaccine disinformation campaigns. Last September, Facebook took down information operations from China that were campaigning for the daughter of Duterte for president – next year, our presidential elections – that network was creating fake accounts for US elections, and it was attacking me.

The virus of lies is highly contagious. They infect real people, who become impervious to facts. It changes the way they look at the world. They become angrier, more isolated. They distrust everything.

In this environment, the dictator wins, crumbling our democracies from within.

I became a journalist 35 years ago when people power in the Philippines helped spark democracy movements around the world. I had the great privilege of reporting on much of Southeast Asia’s transition from one-man authoritarian rule to democracy. 

Inevitably, there is this one moment when power and money chooses – status quo or change: in the Philippines in 1986, it was an elite family’s banner at a protest rally that helped open the floodgates that ousted a dictator. In Indonesia in 1998, months of student protests led nowhere until the business community and the military stepped in, ending nearly 32 years of Suharto.

Those with power and money must choose.

Ask yourselves these questions: Who are you? What do you stand for? What kind of world do you want in the next decade?

The more you have, the more you must risk.

Because silence is complicity.

Whether you’re at the UN or heading a nation or a corporation, or you’re a politician, human rights worker, a journalist, or a citizen, fight – and win – your individual battle for integrity.

At stake is our collective global future.

Please act now.

Courage ON. Thank you.",0
12,Maria A. Ressa,"He calls his protocol 'SDS' – sanitize, disinfect, sterilize
Business owners have to put their people – and their customers – first. 

Going to get a haircut in our science-fiction world can be an adventure, but when I walked into the Basement Salon at SM Aura, I had a new appreciation for details – noticing how the pens were individually sterilized, the counter top wiped down with Clorox sheets, and how contact tracing was automated with each of us getting a pre-printed sheet with our name on it.

I couldn’t help but ask the owner/manager Michael Webb about his systems, and we compared notes. 

We at Rappler have been extra cautious, putting in place protocols and systems, digging into research, estimating costs. Last March, we began to keep an Excel spreadsheet of everyone’s temperatures, with our managers checking their teams and families. 

I do love learning about how to adapt, and I think Michael’s journey and choices give us a path forward. He came home to help his family business, leaving behind a VP post with a semiconductor company in the US. Those corporate processes and thinking helped infuse his choices, but it’s inevitably his values that dictated his path. 

Working in California, Michael was steeped in the HIV battle and in legislation that was introduced by his father, former senator Freddie Webb. Since a salon is a high contact business, Michael put in place systems to deal with HIV and hepatitis. He said it was only a hop-skip-and-a-jump to use those systems for COVID-19. Looking at his software, he showed how he could go back 3-4 years and know exactly which staff members interacted with each customer.

As I was getting my haircut, I saw that he had separated us into clusters, with staff moving from customers in a systematic manner. Again, easier for contact tracing!

Some highlights from our chat below:

Webb describes 3 protocols he put in place for HIV and hepatitis, which he has adapted to the coronavirus: “There are 3 basic hygiene protocols. The first is you sanitize, which is cleaning. Then you introduce another product, which is a disinfectant. Then the third one is when you render an object inert, which is when you sterilize.” 
Every tool used by his staffers are divided into 3 categories: non-critical, semi-critical, critical: “The ones that are critical are defined as those having a higher percentage of actually piercing skin.”
He calls his protocol “SDS” – sanitize, disinfect, sterilize.
Instead of wearing full PPEs, his staffers wear cotton lab coats. The salon has a steamer, and after each customer, the staffer’s outer garments are steamed, a more effective way, Webb said studies show, than keeping one plastic PPE in place all day.
Webb follows the findings for disinfectants of the US Environmental Protection Agency. He gives us some of what he’s found, including what disinfectants he uses and where.
For his staff, it’s a constant education. Keeping them updated about what he reads, his processes. He also has in place a testing process for his staff, and always emphasizes that the best way is to be aware of where they go and what they do. 
While his salon is ready for Christmas, he says he is preparing for New Year’s Eve, and he shares some of the processes he is thinking about adapting, given that he cannot control all the moves of his staff during the holidays. 

So for him, that most likely means increased testing. He drops a tidbit: the best time to test is 3 days after a potential infection. 

Watch our conversation here.

I asked him about advice he would give to families for the holidays, and he was categorical: 1) Wear a mask and a face shield; 2) Be careful. Avoid going out if you don’t have to. If you want to go to a restaurant, order in; 3) Be hygienic, but avoid overkill at home. 

To Webb, it is about knowing and understanding the coronavirus, and accepting that you have a responsibility not only to yourself and your family, but to your neighbors too.

“I am responsible for my clients and my people. That’s how I feel,” said Webb. “I don’t want to look back and say, ‘I should have, you know, I could have…’ I would rather say, ‘I did the best I could.’”",0
13,Maria A. Ressa,"Information operations are manipulating Filipinos online, but finally, Facebook is doing something to stop that
 

Editor’s Note: The original version of this piece was commissioned and first published online by Time Magazine on January 17, 2019, as part of its series on Facebook and its global impact. This is reposted with permission. 

For a time, my reputation – and peace of mind – was demolished by information operations on Facebook. It’s a cautionary tale for the United States.

I run Rappler, an online news site in the Philippines. In my country, Facebook essentially is the internet, thanks to subsidies from telecommunications companies that let people avoid data charges while on the site. But it has also made the Philippines a showcase for the destruction Facebook can enable.

The attacks against me and Rappler began appearing on Facebook in the summer of 2016. A year later President Rodrigo Duterte was repeating them in his State of the Nation Address. I have since been indicted on politically-motivated criminal charges, faced my first arrest warrant, and posted bail. Not just once, but 5 times in two separate courts. I need permission to travel outside the Philippines.

If I lose these tax evasion cases and others filed by the Philippine government, I could go to jail for 10 to 15 years.

All because I – and Rappler, the startup I helped create, 7 years old this month – continue to hold power to account, to do our jobs as journalists, and to #HoldTheLine against impunity in a drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people, according to human rights groups.

We know first-hand how social media and the law has been weaponized against perceived critics of the Duterte administration. We’ve been reporting on it from the start. 

In early October 2016, Rappler published a 3-part series on social media propaganda. It analyzed the emerging information ecosystem using what researchers later called “patriotic trolling” – online, state-sponsored hate meant to silence or intimidate specific targets. After the exposé appeared, I received an average of 90 hate messages per hour for the next month. 

The attacks on Facebook are insidious and extremely personal, from the way I look and sound to threats of rape and murder. As a former war zone correspondent, I have been in the line of fire, but nothing prepared me for this.

After all, a lie repeated a million times becomes the truth, shaping and conditioning public opinion, seeding the messages that would be repeated by President Duterte himself: that Rappler is CIA, fake news, owned by Americans, many more. It hits me every time I look back because these lies form the basis of some of the legal cases against us.

This is our daily pressure cooker: attacked from below by cheap armies on social media, and from above by President Duterte and the government.

The effort was extremely well organized. Each of the government propaganda machine’s 3 main content creators addressed a different slice of society: Sass Sasot created pseudo-intellectual content for the top 1%; Thinking Pinoy (RJ Nieto) targeted the middle class; and singer-dancer turned government official now congressional candidate Mocha Uson riled up the mass base. As early as 2016, an #UnfollowRappler campaign activated at least 52,000 accounts. That was about 1% of our followers at that time – but consider that an earlier investigation showed us that 26 fake accounts on Facebook could reach up to 3 million others.

What mayhem could more than 50,000 Facebook accounts create?

They can reverse perceptions, splitting the real world from the social media world.

We saw it happen. In January 2018, the Pew Global Attitudes Survey found 86% of Filipinos out in the physical world said they trusted traditional news media. If you live on social media, though, your perception was nearly the complete opposite: 83% distrusted it, according to the Philippine Trust Index released that same month. It happened from systematic and exponentially growing attacks on traditional media, which clearly escalated after Duterte took office in June 2016. In the year before the election campaign, the language Duterte used to attack the media – bias(ed) and corrupt or “bayaran” – barely registered in Facebook comments or posts. Afterward, bias came up 2,000 times a day, and bayaran one day approached 4,000. (For example in one day, bias had an unnaturally high, boosted peak of 30,000 comments.) The attacks pounded fracture lines in society repeatedly until perception was made reality.  These attacks fuel anger and hate to tear down trust in truth-tellers: journalists, human rights advocates; to maintain high approval ratings for President Duterte; and to change the values of a significant chunk of our society who now say it’s okay to kill drug users or to let China have portions of Philippine territory in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea). The attacks wage war against opposition politicians, manipulate the Filipino public, and weaken our democracy.

Rappler knows the best and the worst of what Facebook can do. As the world’s largest distributor of news, its refusal to act as a true gatekeeper allows lies to spread faster than truth. For that, I’m among Facebook’s worst critics. Yet Rappler’s exponential growth would not have happened without the social media giant.

I know its immense potential for good. That is why we continue to work with Facebook, as one of 3 fact-checking partners in our country, defining facts and looking at networks that spread lies.

I don’t think we have a choice. This is transformative technology, and we can use it to push Facebook to understand its true impact – good and evil – in the world. I’m cautiously optimistic that the good can prevail. On January 11, in its second takedown of “inauthentic” sites and accounts in the Philippines, Facebook banned a significant chunk of the disinformation ecosystem manipulating Filipinos with a link to the Internet Research Agency and the Russian disinformation ecosystem.

Rappler had identified the network, and written about it, nearly 13 months earlier.",0
14,Maria A. Ressa,"Great teachers who shape our values, our sense of right and wrong, will always be with us
Note: To celebrate National Teacher’s Month and Filipino-American History Month, I’d like to share this weekend in July with you. This first appeared in Rappler’s Brave New World newsletter, August 9, 2019. 

It was a weekend that stirred my soul and reminded me of the details that create our lives: jokes with lifelong friends; an orchestra room where I spent hours practicing – and the stage where we performed; the ties that created the person I have become.
 
My family left the Philippines in 1973 and settled in Toms River, New Jersey. My parents commuted nearly 4 hours a day to New York City so that their kids could avoid the inner city schools. Toms River’s public school system gave me free music lessons, computer programming classes, advanced placement classes that allowed us to compete in Ivy league schools, a future that promised you can accomplish anything if you work hard enough.

Everyone has a teacher who helped make them who they are. Mine is Donald Spaulding. I cried when I saw the announcement of his death on April 8, 2019 and contacted his family. His kids are now all grown up with kids of their own, and on July 28, the many people whose lives he touched came together back on the stage where we grew up for his memorial concert. When we arrived in Toms River, I was the short, quiet kid who could barely speak English. Mr. Spaulding nurtured me and others like me: kids looking to belong, looking for our place in the world. I first found that in music, and that became the foundation of student government, basketball, softball, theater, so much more – extra-curricular activities and academics that shaped my world. When I graduated high school, I was voted “Most Likely to Succeed.”

I couldn’t have done all that without Mr. Spaulding. He was not just my violin teacher and orchestra conductor. He helped me learn to play up to 8 different instruments (some not very good). All these experiments in my life – that is because of Don Spaulding, who would pick me up from the other side of town so that I could have a chance to participate in rehearsals and gigs.

Without him, life would have been so different.

But that was only the beginning. He pushed me to be better than I could ever be – as a person and as a musician.

He helped me choose the music for all the auditions he pushed me to do – from the intermediate and high school orchestras in Toms River to the Garden State Youth Orchestra to All State to the Garden State Philharmonic to so many more. Mr. Spaulding heard every soaring note and every mistake, and always pushed me to do better. If you have never auditioned for first violin or concert mistress, you do not know what stress is! All my after school jobs then were music related: as a music counsellor at Camp Discovery to our T.R. Express: a country-western group of orchestra nerds playing the music we heard on the radio.

During Sunday brunches, we were a string quartet, but at night, we just had the best fun ever – earning more than I would have earned at McDonald’s or Dunkin Donuts. We got together because I wanted him to sing “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” – and when we finished figuring that out, we just kept playing – Kansas’ “Dust in the Wind,” Dan Fogelberg’s “Longer,” so many more. I will never forget playing at the Ground Round with the peanuts on the floor, at our local mall, at Six Flags’ Great Adventure … so many more.

We were a fixture at pop concerts – what fun we had! So at the memorial for Mr. Spaulding – after more than 3 decades, I picked up my violin and played in an orchestra again.

Our conductor, Sue Viksne Degoey, chose the lineup from what many of us played under Mr. Spaulding’s baton. I stepped into my high school self with Pachelbel’s Canon, and Keith Kalemba composed an original elegy.

We rehearsed for a little over an hour, and there we were, coming together, playing for the memory of a man we all loved. That weekend reminded me again that no one can accomplish anything meaningful alone.

A day before our concert some of my closest friends decided to meet at sunset at Island Beach State Park, bring food and drinks, and catch up over a bonfire.
 
It was a perfect day: a cool breeze blowing, just enough for us to sit in front of the fire and reminisce. Gigi and I lived around the block from each other and biked around the woods behind our houses. It was fun to deliberately get lost and then find our way home. Then we would save our money, and when we had enough, bike an hour to get a coke and French fries. Over the years, she carried so many science projects for me: an exploding volcano (which almost exploded at the bus stop), a solar oven .. and as she reminded me, my violin, guitar or whatever other instrument I was playing that day. I suppose we also gravitated together because we were brown in a predominantly white neighborhood. But it was something we were never conscious of because then the Philippines was a far, dim memory.

The past, present and the future came together, and I realized the person you are was already formed in high school. We fell into our old roles: Lisa, always the organizer who always thinks of everything; Cary, our Greek-American pragmatist; Larry, the boy-scout who built the bonfire; Ruthie, our marinerette; Yvonne, our basketball center … and my kid sister and cousin, who joked they were now part of the big kids’ table. So what did I learn? 

That an orchestra is a perfect metaphor for a working democracy: the music gives you systems and notes, but how you play, how you feel, how you lead, how you follow – well, that’s all up to you. It reminded me how much I loved being in the swirl of music, one part listening and soaring, another part counting the beats, watching the ups and downs of our bows, always part of you focused on the conductor, ready to follow. Excess within control. 

That great friendships, despite the distance of time and place, get better with age.

And that teachers, the mentors who point you in the right direction, will always be with you. Mr. Spaulding brought me back across the oceans, to relive, to play, to cry. Thank you, Mr. Spaulding, for your generosity of spirit, for helping me fit in, and for reminding me that music flows through our lives and connects all of us.",0
15,Maria A. Ressa,"‘This is an existential moment in time, where, if we don’t take the right steps forward, democracy as we know it is dead’

This is Maria Ressa’s keynote speech delivered to a standing ovation from nearly 2,000 journalists at the 11th Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Hamburg, Germany, on September 28, 2019. 

An attack on one is an attack on all.

The first time I heard that was more than two decades ago, looking at the virulent ideology that powered al-Qaeda. That was what the terrorists used to justify their attacks. Then at a pivotal moment, when I was still just learning to deal with the new weapon against journalists, Julie Posetti, who’s in the audience now, convinced me that I should be speaking about these attacks on social media – and within 24 hours convinced me to do an interview for a book she was working on for Unesco. Its title: An attack on one is an attack on all.

This is an existential moment in time – where, if we don’t take the right steps forward, democracy as we know it is dead.

The more I study this time – which started with technology’s disruption, then attacks against journalists, then democracy – the more I’m convinced that the attacks against us and our values are so insidious that the equivalent of an atomic explosion has ruptured our worlds – and all we do is chip away at the tip of the iceberg we can see. But please keep this in mind as I speak: an attack of massive casualties has occurred – and most of us don’t know about it.

I’ll talk about 3 points tonight: the battle for truth, the role of American social media platforms, and what we can do about it.

When journalists are under attack, democracy is under attack. Social media platforms are now the world’s largest distributor of news, but, while they’ve taken the revenues, they’ve ignored the gatekeeping powers that news groups have traditionally had.

It takes courage to fight back against the insidious manipulation these platforms have enabled. They’re now used as a weapon against journalists – where lies laced with anger and hate spread faster than facts. (Facts are kinda boring.)

This really hit me last December when Time Magazine named me one of the guardians of truth. At that point in time, I realized – among the Capital Gazette (the journalists who were killed there), the Reuters journalists still in prison in Myanmar at the time and Jamal Khashoggi – I was the only one who was both alive and free, making me think that never before has our profession…protecting our democracies…demanded so much from us.

The battle for truth is the battle of our generation. With technology as the accelerant, a lie told a million times becomes a fact.

Without facts, we don’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust. Without all 3, you can’t have democracy. This is why democracy is broken around the world.

In our country, the bottom up exponential attacks on social media astroturfing and creating a bandwagon effect soften the ground before the same lies came top down from our top government officials.

I know this first-hand: in 14 months, the Philippine government filed at least 11 cases and investigations against me and Rappler. I was arrested twice in a 5-week period, and I’ve posted bail 8 times in about 3 months. I have committed no crime except to be a journalist and to hold power to account.

I’ve seen social media and our legal system weaponized against those who ask questions, who stand up for values, who demand the rights guaranteed under our Constitution, which is patterned after the US Constitution.

When I was first arrested early this year, the officer said, “Ma’am, trabaho lang po.” (Ma’am, I’m only doing my job). Then he lowered his voice to almost a whisper as he read me my Miranda rights. He was clearly uncomfortable, and I almost felt sorry for him. Except he was arresting me – the last act in a chain of events meant to intimidate and harass me because I’m a journalist.

This officer was a tool of power – and an example of how a good man can turn evil – and how great atrocities happen. Hannah Arendt wrote about the banality of evil when describing men who carried out the orders of Hitler in Nazi Germany, how career-oriented bureaucrats can act without conscience because they justify that they’re only following orders.

This is how a nation loses its soul. So you have to know what values you are fighting for, and you have to draw the lines now: where this side you’re good, and this side you’re evil. Help us #HoldTheLine.

So what about American social media platforms? As many of you know now, I’m both a partner and a critic of Facebook. Rappler is one of two Filipino fact-checking partners in the Philippines. Facebook is essentially the internet in the Philippines.

We are the canary in the coal mine because globally Filipinos spend the most time online (more than 10 hours a day) and on social media (the 4th year in a row we’re the top users around the world). But we are also democracy’s dystopian future.

Early this month, I was with Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie (you know he’s just turning 30 years old), and he told me that the Philippines “creates an ideal petri dish where you can experiment on tactics and techniques that you wouldn’t be able to as easily in the West…and if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter, you won’t get caught. And if it does work, then you can then figure out how to port that to the West.”

I asked him if the Philippines paved the way for Brexit and Donald Trump. You know what he said? He sidestepped a little, but I’ll read his entire quote so stay with me:

Filipino politics kinda looks a lot like the United States. You’ve got a president who was Trump before Trump was Trump, and you have relationships with people close to him with SCL and Cambridge Analytica. And you had a lot of data being collected – the 2nd largest amount of data after the United States collected in the Philippines.

This kid behind the psychological operations web of Steve Bannon backed by Robert and Rebekah Mercer added that “colonialism never died, it just moved online.”

So…this nightmare began for me more than 3 years ago. Rappler wrote the first pieces about it globally in 2016. I wrote 2 of the 3 parts of our first series and was rewarded with an average of 90 hate messages per hour.

If nothing changes, what’s happened to us is going to happen to you. It’s already happening now. Underlying it all is greed and fear, in our case the violence a brutal drug war that the UN says has killed at least 27,000 people, far more than the official number of 5,500.

People are afraid to stand up for what is right because there are costs: Rappler in the Philippines is a cautionary tale – and one of my arresting officers said it best when he was trying to silence our young reporter who was livestreaming. He said: “Be quiet, or you’re next.”

This micro-targeting online ad-driven business model structurally undermines human will. Our personal experiences are sucked into a database, organized by AI, then sold to the highest bidder. It is – as it has always been – about power and money. That has also siphoned money away from news groups, and if nothing is done, this represents a foundational threat to markets, election integrity, and democracy itself.

These social media platforms are behavioral modification systems we voluntarily enter. We are Pavlov’s dogs – and let me quote Wylie again as well as Blackberry co-founder Jim Balsillie: they said that data at this micropersonal level is NOT the new oil. It is plutonium. And we need to treat it like plutonium – with all the care that requires. Remember, I said, an atom bomb has exploded – and we all don’t know about it. Until we accept that, we can’t solve the problem.

So what can we do?

First, journalists need to collaborate. Throw out your old definitions. This is a new world. Collaborating isn’t easy because we were born to compete against each other. In the Philippines, our data tells us that news groups have been pushed to the periphery of our information ecosystem, and in the center are disinformation networks – some linked to Russian disinformation networks, some to China. They are all actively sharing each other – while we are not. This is how alternative realities bloom.

We have to stop taking the bait of emotions. Seek what we have in common over what drives us apart because that’s the way the bad guys are working: they take a fracture line in our societies and pound it open to separate us into us vs them.

And it’s not just the journalists…let’s bring in academia, tech, civil society – the truth-tellers. We have to join forces to protect the facts.

We have to fight now, while we’re strong – because, as we have learned, you only get weaker over time because this virus of lies saps civic engagement. If you have no facts, civil society becomes apathetic, and the voice with the loudest megaphone wins.

Second, we need to demand enlightened self-interest from tech companies because, in the long term, yes, the solution is education; medium term: media literacy. But in the here and now? It’s only the tech platforms that can do something meaningful.

Third, we need to create a global database of disinformation networks, and a global interpol that stops the impunity that nations and companies are getting away with today. Remember after the Holocaust and WWII, the world came together to try to stop the worst of human behaviors. That was when we got Bretton Woods, NATO, the UN Declaration of Human Rights. What are the values that govern the internet? How do we punish offenders?

We need to seriously come together and fight because an attack on one is an attack on all.

Power – and bullies – will never stop if you give in to them. We at Rappler live this every day.

Early this month, our presidential spokesman and chief legal counsel to President Duterte threatened to file cases against two news groups, including Rappler, because we called out a glaring conflict of interest. He split hairs and attempted to redefine his actions based on a technicality. One news group apologized. We did not.

Here’s the twist: the apology wasn’t enough for our Palace spokesman. His words ultimately justified Rappler’s decision to #HoldTheLine.

Political bullies who threaten and abuse journalists are never happy until they get complete capitulation.

Our battle is your battle.

Protect the rights guaranteed by our democracies or watch them slowly erode in plain sight. This is the challenge for all of us today – for next year’s Global Investigative Journalism Conference. What can we put in place today to protect our tomorrows?

I want to thank all the news organizations here who helped us shine the light. Please, let us do the same for every journalist under attack in every part of the world.

Remember: an attack on one is an attack on all. ",0

Clear from the genealogy of PhilHealth is its continuing mandate to provide comprehensive and equitable health care. Policy-wise, there should be no more question that aside from quality education, effective public health is a good “strategy for bringing about faster economic development and improving quality of life.” It’s a direct, and no doubt, quick route to higher labor productivity and economic growth.

PhilHealth descended from martial law’s Medicare as administered by the Philippine Medical Care Commission pursuant to the Philippine Medical Care Act of 1969. Total coverage of medical services according to the needs of patients is its ultimate goal.  It was to be an evolving extension of medical care to all residents based obviously on the nation’s financial capability by mandating contribution to help build the medical care fund. 

The basic idea was first to leverage on both the SSS and GSIS medical programs while preparing to cover non-members on a compulsory and automatic basis. Not bad for a developing country in the late 1960s.

A National Health Insurance Program was established in 1995, mandating the creation of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and replacing the Commission as administrator. This law proceeds from the 1987 constitutional mandate for “an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all people at affordable cost.”

For the same reason, the Universal Healthcare (UHC) Law of 2019 automatically enrolled in PhilHealth all Filipino citizens, including overseas Filipino workers. This means any Filipino can avail himself of health care benefits even without a PhilHealth ID card. There is no better way to institutionalize universal health care than through a contributory health insurance scheme.

Yes, the operative words are accessibility and affordability. 

All citizens shall have access to health services at first “with at least a basic minimum package of health insurance benefits.” The law prioritizes a person’s health needs than his ability to pay based on the principle of risk sharing among various income and age groups. There is also unequivocal mandate for PhilHealth to contain cost to help the people afford healthcare services.

Since not every one of the 113-million Filipinos contributes to the fund, and medical cost is rising like crazy, health premium is not just enough even if it was recently jacked up. With a broad coverage of inpatient care, among others, budget support is essential. Funding is short even with contributions from PCSO and PAGCOR and from the budget itself of the Department of Health. 

For 2024, PhilHealth received more than a hundred-billion-peso budget to accommodate an expanded pool of beneficiaries and to sustain current programs. Some 1.31 million indigent and financially incapable patients are to receive medical assistance. With parallel efforts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other government programs, some 12.75 million indigent members are expected to be reached this year. 

This is far from universal even as the intent is. 

If past WHO data were to be a guide, PhilHealth has a lot of homework to do. With sustained population growth, life expectancy in the Philippines surprisingly declined from 69 years in 2000 to 66.4 years in 2021. In Western Pacific, comparable data actually rose from 72.4 years to 77.4 years. In this age, tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death for children below five. Why, this is a scourge of highly impoverished nations.

And if this is not enough, based on statistics from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the healthcare continues to be a big burden for households. Their out-of-pocket payment had the biggest share of 44.5 percent among the health care funding schemes in 2023, higher than government and voluntary healthcare system.

Comparing the Philippines with other ASEAN neighbors in terms of critical health outcome shows some embarrassing results. Three years ago, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies in a study prepared by research fellow Valerie Gilbert T. Ulip and research analyst Lyle Daryll D. Casas ('Regional Health Integration and Cooperation in the Philippines') concluded that we fell behind our ASEAN counterparts. Normally, health systems must have sufficient health facilities offering different types and levels of health services. 

This is not the case for the Philippines.

For instance, hospital beds are limited, short of 400,000 beds. Half of the Filipinos have no timely access to primary healthcare facilities. We spend only about 1.5 percent of GDP to health, really no comparison with Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Our handicap in health human resources is just enormous. Ten percent of our rural units have only one doctor each while many health facilities do not even have a nurse or a midwife. Finally, our public health capacity for emergencies is extremely low. WHO’s international health regulations gave us a score of only 53 percent, only better than Lao PDR and Cambodia.

No AI is necessary to draw the extent of the challenge for the health sector in the Philippines. There is so much ground to flesh out the universality, accessibility and affordability of healthcare system. 

Adding the regular contributions of members to subsidies from the national government and remittances from both PCSO and PAGCOR yields big, big shortfall. Yet, PhilHealth failed to spend all its money in 2024 to the tune of ₱89.9 billion. 

With dwindling fiscal space and burgeoning public debt that has exceeded the threshold of 60 percent of GDP against the commitment of NG to refrain from introducing new taxes or imposing higher taxes, the only recourse of government is to increase the dividend rate and sweep all “unused funds” from government-owned and controlled corporations.

Finance Secretary Ralph Recto was recently quoted by ABS-CBN News saying that the full remittance and appropriate use of PhilHealth’s ₱89.9 billion could add 0.88 ppts to national output and add 600,000 more jobs. Interesting quote, but first, can the remittance be properly done and second, how does one convert it to output and jobs? (To be continued)",0

As we suggested in our last column, it is no secret that the Philippines’ official sports program is not perfect. 

The first known government sports organization was the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF) in 1911, which was formed only to resolve what was then the ongoing “menace of professionalism” and erosion in Philippine sports. Around 50 years later, in the 1960s, the Association for the Advancement of Amateur Athletic (AAAA) came into being. 

Under martial law, Presidential Decree No. 604 established the Department of Youth and Sports Development in 1974 and abolished the PAAF, transferring all its resources and functions to the Department. Later renamed Ministry of Youth and Sports Development in 1979, it was mandated under Letter of Instruction No. 955 to implement Project Gintong Alay (PGA).

PGA sought to put under one roof all development programs of athletics, first for track and field, and later for some other sports. Reported prodigies include the legendary Lydia de Vega, Isidro del Prado, Hector Begeo and Elma Muros. 

Aside from these initiatives, if there’s anything that speaks best of our desire to land in the podium, it is the 1987 Philippine Constitution’s declaration of the importance of sports in establishing a healthy and functioning citizenry. 

In 1990, with the significant evolution of global sports, then President Cory Aquino signed into law a new government sports agency with stronger and more focused objectives. The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was thus born to transform the Filipino people into “a healthy citizenry through various commendable sports development programs.”

The Commission’s vision is focused on one, increased participation in sports by Filipinos, and two, excellence in sports performance by Filipinos. Its mission is to coordinate and implement our national sports program, democratize sports access and training, and elevate the level of training for highly talented and promising athletes for global competition. 

Filipinos can bet that there has never been a dearth of sports projects and programs across the country. PSC lists in its website Batang Pinoy, Indigenous People’s Games, Laro’t Saya sa Parke, Philippine National Games, Pilipinas Para Games and Gender and Development Program. 

So, what ails Philippine sports, that our medal campaigns in global competitions have been sporadic and obviously incoherent?

Veteran sportswriter Joaquin Henson explained some years ago in the Philippine Star why the Philippines has yet to win an Olympic gold after nearly a hundred years of participating in the Olympics. For him, it was “an arduous journey of frustration, exasperation and disappointment.” At that time, the Philippines held the distinction of second in the world for reaping gold-less medals with 10, Malaysia being the first with 11. 

Henson cited the lack of coordination between the PSC and the private organization Philippine Olympic Committee (POC). Government is focused on grassroots development and yet controls the budget to finance national athletes. Meanwhile, the POC consists of the national sports associations that aim to develop star athletes but is undermined by reported politics, graft, nepotism, and incompetence. We are no match to Thailand, Henson argued, which had accumulated more than 30 medals in only 70 years of its Olympics participation. 

Henson also blamed the so-called shot-gun approach in allocating limited resources to several sports, a clear exercise in dissipation. Instead, we need our sports officials to concentrate on niche sports calibrated with weight classification like boxing, judo, weightlifting and similar sports. It would be considered suicidal if we continue to spend feeble resources on sports where our likelihood of success is slim because the sports is free for all.

Funding is another reason for our weak performance not just in the Olympics, but also in the Asian Games or SEA Games. While the law requires the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) to remit five percent of its gross revenues to the PSC, or at that time, ₱200 million monthly, what goes into the operation of the Commission is much less than the required remittance.

Perhaps it’s not asking for the moon if we can also professionalize both the PSC and the POC; less politics, more action. If we can do this, the budget for sports could be rationalized and properly allocated. If the plan is intentional and executed properly, with scorecards and accountability, we should be able to see good, institutionalized results. We can finally add more numbers to our sports greats, those talents that can harvest golds and silvers in global competitions — not as a matter of luck but as a matter of course.

In the last 10 years, it was reported that the PSC received an average of around ₱180 million annually from the public treasury. On top of this meager allocation, the PSC also gets money from PAGCOR and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes (PCSO) and a few other government institutions like the National Sports Development Fund. With additional funding from the Bureau of Customs, Philippine Racing Commission and private donations, that could easily amount to nearly ₱900 million a year. While this amount can seem staggering to the normal Filipino, it’s peanuts compared to what other countries are spending on sports and their athletes. Obviously, this disparity in investment explains our suboptimal performance in international games.

Despite it all, our athletes’ podium finishes prove that we are a country of hope, and that our resilience shines not just during flash floods, but also in the international arena. If we could produce a Hidilyn Diaz in weightlifting and a Carlos Yulo in gymnastics, we must be doing something right. But we could surpass ourselves if we succeed in producing more Diazes and Yulos on a more regular, more systematic basis. 

Yes, we’ll achieve more mileage if we channel some of those prizes to our reinvented sports program. Our athletes deserve a better life after the Olympics, something that could hopefully inspire rather than slacken them. But a better sports development program that produces excellence on a more regular basis should always be the first best.",0

Tik Toks have institutionalized the Carlos Yulo landings in his floor routine for which he was awarded a perfect 15. We see people ending whatever they are doing with Yulo’s trademark open arms, or a series of tumbling into their shoes. With a 3.5 twist, Yulo ascended the Olympic podium with his gold medal, the first man to win an Olympic gold for the Philippines and second to weightlifting idol Hidilyn Diaz to harvest gold from the Olympics. He surpassed himself by winning a second gold in vault competition. Some commentators and sports writers were convinced his ability is otherworldly.   

It is otherworldly because his sports mastery started in his youth. At seven, his grandfather, impressed at his initial stunts at a local playground that is the Paraiso ng Batang Maynila, motivated him to focus on gymnastics. Since they stay along Leveriza Street which is close to Paraiso, he had all the time to do his stunts and tumbling routine. Paraiso truly was once upon a time a training ground for young athletes and sports enthusiasts. In the distant past, it was equipped with some playground equipment and sports facilities including monkey bars. 

Yulo could have been born several years later and missed out on these public facilities, now rare in many localities. They should cost almost nothing compared to the local governments’ own revenues and national tax allotment. Local governments never seem to realize they could produce Olympic champions by spending on some systematic sports development programs that could just spark our young Filipinos’ interest and inspire them to get into the loop. One does not need intelligence fund to highlight the importance of this public infrastructure in nurturing young bodies to global competitiveness. 

From Leveriza, Yulo moved on with his journey with destiny. He competed in various Palarong Pambansa almost annually and won gold, silver and bronze medals in various contests in gymnastics. As a junior, he won mostly gold in the ASEAN School Games and Pacific Rim Competitions. As a senior, Yulo harvested more medals at the Melbourne World Cup, Baku World Cup and Doha World Cup, among others. 

All told, Yulo has emerged as a young and living sports icon. He is a two-time Olympic champion, six-time world champion with two each for gold, silver and bronze; ten-time Asian Games champion; and nine-time SEA Games champion. 

With Yulo’s short stature, social media seems more enamored with “the precision of his form, and the difficulty of his routines especially in the floor exercises, vault and parallel bars.” Nothing beats congenital mastery. 

As the nation awaits Yulo’s return from Paris, enormous benefits await him, too.

The Philippine government is giving him ₱20 million cash while ₱6 million will come from the House of Representatives. The Philippine Olympic Committee is also gifting him with a house and lot. What was originally a two-bedroom condo unit in McKinley Hill, BGC worth ₱24 million, Megaworld was reported to have upgraded it to a three-bedroom unit worth ₱32 million, with ₱3 million cash bonus.

As if these were not enough, Yulo will also be getting from different donors such benefits as lifetime free eating privileges both buffet and ala carte, free gastro consultations and colonoscopy, free engineering designs and free furniture worth a hundred thousand pesos. The Guardian reported that he was also offered franchises for a coffee and lemon business plus a ₱10 million brand ambassadorship contract for a beauty clinic.

Dazzling, but these acts of appreciation may miss the point.

True, these donations to Yulo, and previously to Diaz, would hopefully inspire them to do many times better in the next Olympics, and many more young athletes to follow in their footsteps. But we need more than that. We need to institutionalize excellent performance in world sports competition. Sad to say, the previous budget allocated to sports development by past comparisons is not even a 10th of what other ASEAN countries spend on sports development. GMA news once described the country’s sports budget “like loose change against the income” of boxing legend Manny Pacquiao.

In fact, for 2025, the budget allocated to the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was reduced from ₱1.156 billion in 2024 to only ₱725 million. This budget covers general operations, amateur sports, training and preparation for the SEA Games in Thailand and the Asian Winter Games in China.

So, whatever happened to the Philippine Senate’s Resolution that commended the brilliant Yulo for winning the gold medal for the men’s floor exercises at the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Competition in Stuttgart, Germany. The Senate also recognized the potentials of Filipino athletes and in particular Yulo’s achievement as a “wake up call for our government to focus and provide more support to our athletes” competing in sports where size does not matter. 

We recall what happened nine years ago when the Philippine sports contingent to the SEA Games finished a poor sixth, the PSC cried “lack of budget.” At the Tokyo Olympics of 2020, Filipino athletes complained that the Philippine government failed them. Even Diaz herself complained of insufficient funds for her training that eventually led to the Philippines’ first Olympic gold.

As Muhammad Ali once quipped, champions are made from something they have deep inside them — a desire, a dream, a vision. For Ali, the will must be stronger than the skill. A sports development program would build the skills of our young athletes, it is hard work, strong discipline and perseverance that would build their will.

Sustaining his will is going to be a tall order for Yulo. Aside from the easy life that awaits him, and this could soften him a bit, he will have to face the reported issue with his own mother and his final decision on the next chapter of his love life. In sports like artistic gymnastics, any small distraction could cost the gold.  (To be concluded next week)",0
19,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT To be sure, and we heard them from NewsWatch Plus, there were many “sanas” during the 3rd SONA (State of the Nation Address) of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Sana bumaba ang presyo ng bilihin. Sana dumami ang trabaho. Sana ipagtanggol ang West Philippine Sea. Sana ipatigil na ang POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators). The civil society demands a good scorecard from this government.

With a fine-tooth comb, NEDA as the planning authority should do the monitoring having been mandated to prepare the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028. It’s an excellent Plan because it formalizes a comprehensive roadmap complete with actionable policies and programs and sets for Congress an appropriate set of legislative priorities to address both short-term and medium-term issues. A good scorecard and monitoring system should lead to a good execution of public policy. Otherwise, the vision for this nation could just ossify on paper. 

We focus on controlling inflation because it remains the most urgent concern of the Filipinos based on the latest Pulse Asia Survey for June 17-24 and Octa Survey for June 26-July 1. Around two-thirds of Pulse Asia and Octa respondents rated inflation control as the most urgent national concern. 

Inflation is closely related to the other concerns like increasing workers’ pay, because higher prices weaken their purchasing power. Reducing poverty is also critical because prices are already high. Creating more jobs is a direct means of empowering people to mitigate their poor condition and weaker spending capacity. Finally, fighting graft and corruption is considered one big impediment to appropriate public policy to provide infrastructure and social services. 

Table 1.1 of the PDP 2023-2028 provides us with the baseline of food and headline inflation at 5.7 percent and 5.6 percent for the period January-November 2022. For both indicators, the target was set at two to four percent for 2024 and 2025. 

We consider three components behind the inflation management in the Philippines. One is appropriate monetary policy; two, is a set of strong non-monetary measures to manage the supply side; and three, responsible fiscal policy. 

On monetary policy, we give high credit to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In the last six months of the previous administration, the BSP was so behind the curve before it decided to tighten monetary policy. This was rather too late and too little. For as early as March 2022 onwards, actual inflation had already reached the 4.0 percent upper end of the target, with inflation forecasts also subsequently breaching their targets for both 2022 and 2023.

When the Marcos government took over on July 1, 2022 the new BSP leadership jacked up the policy rate by 75 basis points (bps) from 2.5 percent to 3.25 percent in an off-cycle meeting. That and more adjustments came, running a total of 450 basis points to address the surging inflation for both 2022 and 2023.

By December last year, the year-on-year monthly inflation fell within the target at 3.9 percent. For the first six months of this year, inflation averaged 3.5 percent. The new BSP leadership should also be commended for keeping its focus on price stability even as various quarters called for a monetary policy reversal in order to stimulate the credit market and stimulate economic activities. 

It is not correct to suggest that today, the BSP should have eased monetary policy because one, it is using lagging indicators; two, monetary policy has lagged effects of about 18 months; and three, inflation data masks cumulative effects of previous price movements.

In reality, the BSP sets its monetary stance not by looking at the past, but by looking into the future based on its forecasts for the next two years. Whatever monetary steps taken today would not be felt tomorrow or the following week, but over a period of about 18 months. Previous inflation rates are monitored because they are useful in discerning how the previous decisions fanned out. Finally, because inflation eats into the purchasing power especially among the daily wage earners among us, the BSP has to be stubbornly committed to win the war against inflation. Due to dominant upward risks, the BSP was correct in keeping its tight monetary policy until today.

After all, the impact on growth has been quite manageable. High inflation discourages personal consumption which accounts for around three quarters of GDP. 

Well, what the BSP could have avoided was its press statement on a possible early easing ahead of the US Fed that rattled the FX market and sent the peso past the ₱58 to a dollar exchange rate. Given the exchange rate pass through, and if prolonged, that could have some inflationary consequences. At the time, the BSP’s risk-adjusted forecasts exceeded the target.

On non-monetary measures, high mark is impossible. Food, especially rice, production is not sufficient, farmers’ productivity remains low. The ax should fall squarely on the Department of Agriculture, National Irrigation Authority, DTI and other relevant government agencies. We have yet to see a coherent food security program. No wonder for June alone, food inflation continued to be high at 6.5 percent, no farther away from the previous year’s 6.7 percent. Rice inflation remained double digit at 22.5 percent. 

There is an Interagency Committee on Inflation and Market Outlook. Its mandate is clear: address supply and logistics issues including measures to combat immoral and illegal profiteering. They have yet to deliver. For instance, it took eternity to get the tariff duties on imported rice reduced from 35 percent to 15 percent. 

A few words about public finance. There was so much in the 2023 and 2024 national budgets that could have funded priority infrastructure in agriculture and industry as well as in research and development, education and skills retraining programs that could have easily translated into higher economic growth and perhaps better supply outcome, something good for inflation management. Fiscal consolidation is also crucial because the fiscal space is slim; excessive spending could reignite higher demand pressure. This could compromise price stability. For this metric, fair score is fair.

The IMF’s Tobias Adrian talked about 10 metrics aimed at helping central banks (CBs) and policy makers fortify CBs independence. Adrian was quick to point out that “this is the first new CB independence index in 30 years.”

These 10 metrics are: CB governor’s independence from the executive; CB’s governing body’s independence from the executive; budgetary independence from the legislature; monetary policy independence from the executive; primacy of price stability; long-term direct lending to the government; short-term lending to the government; financial independence; lending outside the financial system; state audit bodies role in ensuring operational efficiency of CBs.

He admitted to his audience at the Bank of Thailand in mid-June that many of these self-explanatory metrics are based on existing indices with new variables introduced including financial and budgetary independence, board composition, and the role of state audit bodies. Based on the views of central bankers themselves, Adrian stressed that the most critical component of CB independence is financial independence. To them, the least important is short-term lending to the government.

In the Philippines, one can only imagine what would happen to the independence of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) if it were to ask Congress for annual appropriation, or seek additional capital. Members of Congress could even investigate the Monetary Board why it has kept interest rate steady for more than a year, or closed an erring bank with strong political backing. 

Good, the 1987 Philippine Constitution explicitly mandated the establishment of an independent central monetary authority and implemented by Republic Act (RA) 7653 of June 14, 1993 by establishing a new autonomous and independent BSP in the same year. After a quarter of a century in 2018, RA 7653 was amended by RA 11211 increasing its capitalization from ₱50 billion to ₱200 billion. 

However, if indeed financial and budgetary independence is most critical, the continued independence of the BSP rests on the complete capitalization from ₱50 billion to ₱200 billion. But after the BSP charter amendment six years ago, only ₱10 billion was added to the BSP’s initial capitalization. With the establishment of the Maharlika Investment Fund, the full capitalization of the BSP could be further delayed because the BSP’s annual dividend that should be reverted to the central bank for capital build-up will instead be diverted to the investment fund up to P50 billion.

But as Adrian would remind us, CB “independence is significantly stronger in the countries where inflation targets are more firmly entrenched in central bank operations.”

Weaknesses are seen at the level of CB management as well as in its budget and financial operations, monetary policy and the prohibition of lending to the government and outside the financial system. Since financial independence is considered most important, any improvements here can offer the bigger “bang for the buck.” He recognized that future legal amendments may be necessary but long and winding. 

Instead, he advised the use of several IMF tools requiring no legislation. The first tool is the IMF Central Bank Transparency Code or CBT released in 2020. The Code has five pillars consisting of transparency in governance, policies, operations, outcome and official relations. Each pillar consists of various components that could guide CBs improve their transparency and communication practices that lead to policy credibility. 

The second tool is stress testing CBs’ balance sheets. Doing this will help them assess their own financial independence. As Adrian clarified, this is particularly helpful for many advanced, and for that matter even emerging, countries that expanded their respective balance sheets due to the exigencies of the pandemic. This should also be useful for CBs with large and active foreign exchange operations that expose them to interest rate and duration risks on their FX securities. Such risks should be properly considered in CB capital policies.

A quote from Adrian should resonate too many CBs “…a deteriorating CB balance sheet would negatively affect profit distribution — ultimately creating fiscal risks, including through the possibility of having to recapitalize the CB.”

We dread the day when CBs have to lobby with their parliaments for additional capitalization. They would be forced to bite the political bullet. 

The last tool is the CB operational efficiency review. This should require the CBs to rationalize their operational costs to achieve efficiency. Policy-related costs are left out but other costs including staffing, procurement, and other logistics costs are benchmarked against best practices. This will encourage CBs to avoid unnecessary expenses especially in staffing and procurement which may be subject to corruption.

While Adrian referred to the 10 metrics as the first in 30 years, an interesting article came out from the World Bank on “Measuring the Independence of Central Banks and Its Effect on Policy Outcomes” by Alex Cukierman, Steven Webb and Bilin Neyapti 32 years ago in 1992. They developed four measures: legal index; rate of turnover of CB governors; index based on a questionnaire answered by specialists in 23 countries; and an aggregation of the legal index and the rate of turnover. 

Their interesting finding: legal independence is not inversely proportional to inflation in developing countries but it is the rate of turnover of CB governors which turned out to be a better proxy for CB independence. 

We cannot therefore resist the temptation to conclude with the World Bank’s quote of Arnold Lobel’s 1972 comics: “Frog and Toad Together:”

“Willpower is trying hard not to do something that you really want to do,” said Frog.

“You mean like trying not to eat all these cookies,” asked Toad.

“Right,” said Frog. He put all the cookies in a box. “There, now we will not eat any more cookies.”

“But we can open the box,” said Toad.

“That is true,” said Frog. He tied some string around the box. He got a ladder and put the box up on a high shelf. “There, now we will not eat any more cookies.”

“But we can climb the ladder…” ",0
21,Jose Ma Montelibano,"The excitement surrounding gold and bronze medals, as well as the near-misses, has reached its peak. The first half of August has brought us more golden moments than ghostly ones, which I consider a true blessing. Now that we are in the second half of the month, the character of August is beginning to shift back to its traditional atmosphere.

The weather has been relatively mild, with no typhoons so far in August, thanks to July, which preemptively took the brunt of Typhoon Carina early on. We have experienced a few thunderstorms, but that is just typical for this time of year. This month, I’ve monitored two earthquakes so far: one in Surigao del Sur and the other off Northern Bohol. However, perhaps the more concerning issue is Taal Volcano, which has been emitting volcanic smog (or vog). Kanlaon Volcano remains restless but has been calmer since its disturbances two months ago.

What is turning increasingly sour is the political landscape, particularly the escalating feud between the Marcos and Duterte families. This conflict has sparked speculation that extends beyond mere politics, hinting at misgovernance and crime. I’ve read about congressmen pushing for the Commission on Audit (COA) to audit or disclose its findings regarding the hundreds of millions in confidential funds under the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education. Furthermore, there is tension surrounding the Vice President’s complaint about the reduction of her security detail, which has been cut from over 400 personnel to just over 300.

The more sensational news revolves around revelations from a former Customs Intelligence officer, who claims that after apprehending a large quantity of imported shabu, he was arrested and imprisoned. There is also a video from a press conference in which former President Duterte angrily and publicly orders the arrest of the Customs officer. Today, allegations suggest that the Duterte family has been involved in the importation of shabu along with controversial Chinese nationals. Adding to the troubles of August, the Bureau of Immigration reported that former mayor Alice Guo, a suspected non-Filipino citizen who managed to run for and be elected, has left the country without passing through border controls. Even more troubling is the possibility that Alice Guo might have been entering and exiting the Philippines without the knowledge of immigration and border officials. Golden moments are quickly overshadowed by embarrassing incidents, all courtesy of the pervasive corruption eroding the foundations of our governance and noble culture.

As I write this, we are in that part of August 2024 when a super blue moon lights up the sky. A super blue moon occurs due to the combination of three astronomical events: a full moon, a supermoon, and a blue moon. According to NASA, this rare alignment happens when the different cycles of blue and supermoons coincide on the calendar.

What is technical or cosmic in nature is not only beautiful to behold but also sparks many other conversations, particularly in astrology. Special meanings are ascribed to unique astronomical coincidences, and I cannot fault those who believe there is something magical or spiritual about full moons in general, and super blue moons in particular. Nature has a way of reminding us, through its beauty or power, that there is much we still do not comprehend. We do know, however, that full moons are truly a sight to see and that the moon’s movement affects ocean tides.

In our ignorance of the full context and role of the moon in earthly life, we tend to dismiss its significance—unless one is connected to life around the ocean and seashores. Or, in that ignorance, we speculate about hidden meanings, both spiritual and occult, using our intuition or imagination.

Ignorance often drives people to act in ways that can be irrational or even foolish. When we lack understanding, we feel insecure, leading us to create configurations of life that ease that insecurity. Too often, we follow blindly, either a cult leader or a herd. One thing is certain: we cannot help but speculate, even gossip, simply to vent our fears. Many politicians or religious leaders have exploited this throughout history, profiting and gathering armies of followers by tapping into the fears of the uninformed.

In more recent times, however, there are fewer spellbinders and religious fanatics, mainly because money has overtaken many of them. Money has taken on god-like powers because society has decreed it so, placing it as the primary value in life. Money is now considered the master key to all problems, replacing the deity we once revered. Our traditional value system has become warped and is now centered around money as the ultimate goal. This distortion persists until death becomes imminent and undeniable, coupled with the growing realization that money cannot halt our mortality.

The ascendancy of money is proportional to the descendancy of our capability to stand on our two feet from the power of what we can do ourselves. The more we do not know how to fend for ourselves, the more we depend on money to do it for us. This weakness is what makes the world go round, as the old saying goes, as money is the tail that wags the dog. It is pitiful to witness the way money has risen to capture mankind over my lifetime, but it is a bitter reality that must be admitted.

In the true sense, there is no learning poverty among our young. Children by divine or natural design are like sponges – they learn whether they try to or not. If there is now a measured “learning poverty” among them, it is directly proportional to the poverty of teaching – meaning what is taught is poor, impoverished, severely lacking in quality and in spirit. This is, to my mind, the greatest challenge before us today, how to undo the artificiality of the life we live and discard the alternative reality dominating us.",0
22,Jose Ma Montelibano,"August, the ghost month. I always thought it must have been the Chinese influence on our local culture, but Google says that the ghost month is part of the traditional belief systems of several other Asian countries as well. According to these beliefs, the ghost month is when the doors of the spirit world are opened, and the restless spirits search for peace, prayers, or pleasure in the earthly realm.

What complements and deepens the belief in the ghost month is that August often brings heavy rains or typhoons, resulting in floods. The ghost month is typically wet, gloomy, and inhospitable. The climate enhances the eerie atmosphere of August, as if nature itself is warning us to be cautious and to stay indoors, given the challenging weather conditions.

However, there were signs that August 2024 would be different from the typical ghost month.

Typhoon Carina arrived early, bringing torrential and record-setting rains and floods, and setting a gloomy tone after a relatively well-delivered presidential speech during the SONA had eased the negativity in the air. But that was in July, not August. Instead, August began with a bang. From being ghostly, it turned golden, thanks to Caloy Yulo, who won two gold medals. Female boxers Nesty Petecio and Ain Villegas contributed two bronze medals, bringing the Philippines’ total to four Olympic medals—the most in our Olympic history.  I know there were disappointments too, but winning medals at the Olympics is no easy feat. EJ Obiena and Bianca Pagdanganan came close to adding two more bronze medals, but fate was not kind to them. Neither were the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) and the National Golf Association of the Philippines (NGAP), which failed to provide our national golfers, Bianca and Dottie Arbina, with their uniforms. They provided many excuses, but none justified the embarrassment our golfers faced while having to paste the Philippine flag on their personal T-shirts.

Anyway, what an August this has been so far—so opposite its reputation—and I am thankful. At the same time, August still remains the ghost month, with two more weeks to go. I suggest we stay careful and cautious, even if we do not wish to focus on the negatives. The world is turbulent; it is not just the spirits who seek peace. The Middle East is a hot global flashpoint, the Russia-Ukraine war continues, and the West Philippine Sea remains troublesome for Asia.

The situation on the home front is equally troubling. The rivalries between the Marcoses and Dutertes are escalating in intensity and becoming increasingly contentious. It’s an unusual conflict arising from two partners who recently achieved success in winning the presidency and vice-presidency. However, a third of the electorate believes that the Commission on Elections (Comelec) secured this victory through a seemingly miraculous Smartmatic system. Lacking technical expertise, I reserve my condemnation on this matter. Nevertheless, I previously highlighted the illegitimacy of the 2022 elections due to widespread vote-buying.

While the two-thirds, amounting to approximately 31 million voters, who claim to have supported Marcos and Duterte are becoming embroiled in a deepening conflict, I take solace in the fact that the minimum of 15 million voters for Leni are choosing to remain detached from the struggles of the deeply divided Uniteam. They should continue to distance themselves from this escalating dispute, which could potentially turn deadly. It is enough for these 15 million to uphold their integrity, thereby fostering honesty, transparency, and accountability in their own lives.

In times of chaos, we must ground ourselves and our families in fundamental survival principles within a spirit of bayanihan. Very few among us are wealthy enough to comfortably weather sudden upheavals. We must safeguard our food supply, strive to produce as much as possible, and work together to establish a more localized food network.

If we pay attention, we notice that government projects are now often worth tens or even hundreds of billions. There isn’t much we can do about that except hope that project costs are inflated by no more than 30% since the rumored kickback is around 40%.

While some individuals can engage actively in anti-corruption initiatives, most of us should focus our efforts closer to home. Embrace sustainable practices and grow your food wherever possible. Those in the majority who face financial hardships can mitigate the effects of inflation by cultivating as much of their own food as they can.

By taking charge of our own needs instead of relying on others, we can also teach younger generations to be resourceful. A resurgence of the Do-It-Yourself culture must begin with food production. Being self-sufficient empowers us, ultimately fostering confidence and resilience. Our children and grandchildren will not learn these essential skills unless we pass them on. They are already victims of what is termed “learning poverty,” which naturally indicates an equivalent poverty in teaching.

There is a long list of things that are already wrong that can get worse, but that is not our focus in this article. Rather, like our athletes who made it against the worse of odds, we must try to go for the gold, too. We have waited for our leaders to solve our problems and, as a result, we have dug our own holes deeper. There is no Tallano gold, no 20 peso/kg rice, and no Uniteam – only budol after budol.

I pray, sooner than later, that we understand how the brighter tomorrow is in our hands first before the leaders try it themselves. But if we fail, I believe that they, too, will fail.",0
23,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I was with friends when the news of Caloy Yulo winning his first gold medal was announced. Immediately, the euphoria began. We could not help it; it felt like rain after a long, painful drought. I do not think it was just a drought of Olympic medals, even if gold. We know that we are up against the elite athletes of the whole world in their own unique arena – the Olympics. We want the gold like everyone else, but we know it is not a matter of entitlement, not something we can expect as a matter of right. That is why, when we get it, like Caloy got it for us, we celebrate like crazy – one of our own is the best among the best.

Our euphoria, however, was much more than that. Yes, Caloy’s first gold triggered it, but there was a dam about to burst and it did. Beyond sports, many Filipinos have long been in a painful drought. It is hard to put in words because then, they would sound partisan, as though the drought is only a matter of politics. No, it is not. It is more than politics, it is more than economics; it is everything that we call a better Philippines, the search for what is good and right, for peace and harmony, and freedom from poverty and the cesspool of exploitation that blankets the country.

The one thing about living long enough and being observant for most of it is that I see aspects of reality not as random events but as parts of continuing threads. This capacity is not mine alone but for every Filipino who remembers, looks, thinks, and can connect the dots, as they say. Vicious cycles remain both vicious and cycles only because the pain from experiencing them is not learned or quickly forgotten. Those who use the political slogan “Never Again” must be aware of how inutile it is for people who forget and cannot connect the dots.

It takes a deliberate decision to pursue what should be a common dream for all citizens after that dream is frustrated again and again. Septuagenarians like me, no matter how much of an activist we may have been earlier in life, also tire, also despair, also want to give up. We have witnessed the vicious cycles more times than we care to count, and it makes us wonder if reason and intelligence are truly natural features of humans. I have wondered for a long time, and I only know that I cannot count on the consistency of these great faculties. One thing that I have always counted on is the idealism of the young. It is like a guaranteed gift, a divine safety mechanism against the weakness of man when tempted by greed or lust for power. And, by the way, I do not mean only public officials, whether elected or appointed. In a democracy, the majority of citizens have to enable the greedy and power-hungry. In our democracy, the majority of citizens have truly empowered them. There may be a variety of reasons, but ultimately, citizens have empowered the greedy and power-hungry.

Staying in a democracy that needs us badly to be the citizens that a democracy needs forces us to find our hopes and aspirations in the nobility of our young. From birth to teenage years, the fire of idealism is a natural force. However, it is not invincible. During this same period, idealism is exposed to the harsher realities of life. It may be material poverty and the squalor it festers in that inflates our animalistic nature rather than grows our humanity. More deadly, though, is the squalor of corrupt values and the behavior they engender.

Understanding this as one cycle I have observed in the decades I have lived, it now makes me doubt if all the activism for good governance and good citizenship is worth pursuing. The dramatic shift of societal values from our traditional ones to the dominant ascendancy of money and power cannot be restrained simply by a Constitution, no matter how idealistic it is. In fact, the more idealistic the Constitution is, the more impossible it becomes to adhere to.

There remains only the natural idealism of our young before they lose it to compromise and the need to survive in a materialistic world. Nurturing that idealism is becoming more urgent as the strongest prevention against perennial corruption and poverty. Strange as it may seem, the greedy and corrupt try to hide their dirty ways from their own young as long as they can. Advocacy to nourish the young’s idealism should have more open access to them with the least resistance from the evildoers of society.

This idealism is being unnaturally weakened by the very system we had hoped would strengthen it – mass education. That is why I am so focused on learning poverty, especially that part which measures our almost total failure in developing among our young students the capacity to grasp instructions. I am much less concerned with language, math, and even science as subjects. It is this incapacity to grasp instructions that stunts the development of the body, emotions, and mind. We risk losing the vaunted Filipino trait that has made us resilient against man and nature – diskarte or resourcefulness.

I acknowledge the remarkable achievements of Caloy Yulo and all other athletes who have elevated our national pride before the world. I congratulate them, and I am grateful to them. I have celebrated, enjoyed the moment of victory as though my own, too.

Now, I must remain focused on the 91% of public-school students who are victims of learning poverty. Even amidst the victories and celebrations brought to us by selected heroes of the moment, I cannot shake the thought of this 91% of the Filipino public-school students and the bleak future they face. It is to them and their liberation from ignorance or incapacity that we must dedicate more of our lives.",0
24,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I chose to write this article well before my weekly deadline. My mind is full of thoughts that I don’t want to let fade away once the current crisis is over. I recall September 25-26, 2009, when Typhoon Ondoy devastated Metro Manila and surrounding provinces, dumping a record amount of rain. Who could have imagined that Typhoon Carina would follow in Ondoy’s footsteps and even surpass it in rainfall?

Fifteen years ago, I was younger and more able to actively participate in Gawad Kalinga’s relief operations. What I witnessed was heart-wrenching. It wasn’t just the extent of the damage; it was who was affected and why. Typhoon Carina’s impact was no different—it was the poor who bore the brunt.

As always, there is widespread criticism of government inefficiency and possibly neglect. This pattern remains unchanged from 15 years ago. While there are now more details about the 5,500 flood control projects that were not there in 2009, the response remains similar. Government reactions, including Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s focus on trash and climate change as primary causes, are superficial. The root causes are deeper and more complex, which is why the flooding in Metro Manila will persist beyond his term.

Trash is merely a consequence, not a root cause. It exacerbates other issues. While the poor communities along riverbanks are often blamed for the trash, we must ask a crucial question: Why are they there? Riverbanks, canals, seashores, and crevices are not suitable for habitation, yet millions of Filipinos have settled there. They only end up being displaced when natural or man-made disasters strike, such as fires in the slums. But they will return, as they have in the past. Some slums in Metro Manila have been there for 50 years or more.

The reason they are there is straightforward: they have nowhere else to go to survive. The next question is: Where did they come from?

Many are survivors of previous calamities in their home provinces, mainly in the Visayas and Bicol, which are frequently hit by typhoons. When storms, earthquakes, landslides, and floods devastate their communities, hunger drives them to seek work in cities and towns. They leave because they have no other option.

Thus, when discussing calamities, climate change, and trash, we must address poverty. We need to understand the impact of calamities on the poor and how hunger and despair force them to relocate.

Poverty, like flooding, damages lives and property. To address poverty, we must examine who is affected, why, where, and how. Poverty is a consequence of deeper issues, leading us to the root cause: corruption.

Corruption is an insatiable force that consumes everything in its path if given the chance. Addressing Metro Manila’s flooding also means tackling corruption and poverty, not just adapting to climate change.

Looking at corruption and poverty in the Philippines requires a brief historical perspective. In the past, when our population was small and land abundant, the datu system needed people to make land productive. People had real value, while land was less significant.

Colonial rule, however, introduced a greedy master. Colonizers, driven by the desire for loot and bounty, distributed land grants to favored individuals as rewards or in exchange for tribute. Since it was all agricultural then, tribute from people mostly meant what people could produce. Despite the abundance of land, people were all the more necessary for cultivation and tribute. People retained more value over land.

Modernity shifted these dynamics. Advances in science and technology, particularly in reducing infant mortality, led to a population boom. More people served the few elites, who maintained their power and wealth. The elite, both historically and currently, have exploited others. This exploitation, deeply rooted in history, continues to shape our society. And why the term elite still carries a pejorative nuance about it.

Development has followed a master-slave dynamic, making calamities disproportionately destructive to the poor. The zoning laws and their enforcement are suspect, to say the least. They produce comfort for some, luxury for a few, and almost inhuman conditions for most. The real estate developers do not plan for the poor, but the government must. And it never did with a sense of respect and dignity.

Knowing what we have known for decades from our own weather patterns, government and private developers never established clear and equitable zoning principles. Naturally, when the ratio between land and people allows density, even traffic flow is choked – all for money.

Despite the Philippines’ democratic ideals, historical and traditional patterns of superiority and entitlement persist. Until democracy evolves beyond these historical inequalities, the divide will remain, with only superficial gestures toward equality. And we can forget solving floods in a metropolis that continues to defy safety and social risks.

Democracy is not a gift but a challenge. It must be earned, and it requires sacrifice, even the possibility of death. Democracy can be a powerful shield against calamities, poverty, and corruption if it prioritizes the common good over elitism. Intervention towards a sick metropolis can correct extreme anomalies and guide future development to be more friendly to the majority.

The power of democracy lies in the hands of the people, if they choose to seize it. I do not see it coming soon, however, because the people, especially the poor, continue to endure their fate.",0
25,Jose Ma Montelibano,"The Sona is over but the rains and floods are just starting. From a special report card day with a lot of clapping and cheering, it is back to the streets – and the streets are very wet.

I used to remember as a kid that we had longer rain months 70 years ago versus today. It’s either the La Niña phenomenon was occurring quite often then, or global warming has generally shortened the annual periods of rain. Because of that memory in the 50s and 60s, I am less worried about the frequent rains than I am with the longer hot months.

Pagasa today would describe our climate as 6 months wet and six months dry. This ratio is not at all when I remember, and not also how our climate was described decades before. Maybe Wikipedia has a better description that Pagasa, maybe because it can trace global climate records further back in time. Wikipedia claims we have three seasons instead of two, and I think I understand and accept why.

The three seasons are: a hot dry season from March to May, a rainy season from June to November, and a cool dry season from December to February. If I recall correctly, a powerful typhoon visited my hometown one early December in 1951 and devastated Bacolod City among other cities and towns in Central Visayas. The whole roof was blown away and we had to abandon that house. I do not need to recall the names of other typhoons that hit the Philippines on Decembers, Januarys and Februarys. That means the cool dry season described by Wikipedia is too often visited by not only rain but strong typhoons. Perhaps, because of my later advocacy against poverty, I had personally participated in relief and rehabilitation work when typhoons hit from December to February (mostly in the Visayas and Mindanao).

In historical warfare, terrain and weather are the most critical factors. They are matters of life and death that can cause victories or great defeats. But they remain critical factors in our daily lives as Filipinos as well. Between El Niño and La Niña and the pattern of typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions we experience, I am puzzled why our national and local governance do not give terrain and weather the importance they hold over our daily lives.

It is no surprise, then, that we go through the same consequences of disasters that are already part of our national cycle. If we do not put terrain and weather front and center in our daily and annual planning, we are going to get hurt – not the terrain and weather. And it is the poor among us, many more than the official numbers used by the government, that suffer the most.

Since this pattern has been happening since our independence from the USA, the cumulative damage to lives, property, and our way of life is shocking. More than that, it is almost criminal negligence by both national and local governments. Most actions have been reactive, ending up as band aid solutions to recurring threats. I have seen many sea walls put up over the last several decades, standing there as evidence of what appears to be more than just short-term interventions.

It is sad to say but I just have to, not as a way of putting blame on the elite, that the rulers of the country, including the government, never cared enough for the poor majority. The evidence is how we treat the victims of disaster, not just after a calamity, but thereafter as well.

Landlessness was a root problem because of this elitist consciousness in society, as though there was no recognition and appreciation of a divine plan that created a sacred relationship between man and land. For such a God-fearing people, or so claimed by many, a fundamental mandate of survival was belittled, as though the vast majority without wealth or influence can live like birds on a tree or fish in the water.

Man is a mammal, and from a scientific point of view, man is also a mammal that is part of the animal kingdom of the species Homo sapiens. In other words, man needs land and cannot exist without that land as part of his environment. He needs water and air, too, of course, but so far, it is his need for land to survive and develop as a human being that is most threatened, restricted, or denied.

The Filipino poor in my lifetime, or since operational independence in 1946, has been so undervalued that control and free use of land had been denied him. Most Filipinos were squatters, unable to get titles to land where their own ancestors had been born, lived, tilled, and died for centuries. A document overtook the value of human beings, disregarded their natural rights to their ancestral lands, because others a century or more later titled lands they never originally possessed.

As a result of modernization, when those with land titles began to find greater value as real estate rather than producers of agricultural products, millions of Filipinos were restricted or evicted from lands where they and their ancestors had lived. Displaced Filipinos had to go to seashores that stayed valueless, to upland slopes where the rich had no interest, and riverbanks and canals deemed unbuildable areas.

Then came the storms, the floods, the droughts, the earthquakes, and the volcanic eruptions. Those living along seashores and upland slopes were forced by hunger to move to urbanized areas in town centers and cities where they could beg or find menial work. Because of the terrain and the climate, plus the shortsightedness of greedy businessmen and corrupt government officials, Metro Manila and similar cities absorbed refugees from calamities and witnessed slums grow.

We pay for disregarding natural and social laws, for violating our higher cultural values and norms, succumbing to personal interests over the common good.

Yes, the Sona is over and Typhoon Carina just jolted us back to reality.",0
26,Phind Instant,"Income inequality has reached alarming levels in the Philippines, threatening the country's progress towards becoming a middle-class society free of poverty. According to recent reports, the Philippines has one of the highest rates of income inequality in East Asia, with the top 1% capturing 17% of national income while the bottom 50% shares only 14%.

This stark divide between the rich and the poor is not just a matter of statistics - it has real-world consequences for millions of Filipinos struggling to make ends meet. Despite economic growth and poverty reduction efforts, inequality persists and even widened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic exposed existing vulnerabilities and exacerbated inequalities in healthcare access, education, and economic opportunities.

To address this pressing issue, policymakers should prioritize several key areas:

1. Improving access to quality education, especially for disadvantaged groups like girls and those from low-income backgrounds. Education is critical for breaking cycles of poverty and inequality.

2. Strengthening social protection programs and unemployment insurance for informal sector workers. This would provide a safety net during economic downturns and allow workers to weather financial shocks.

3. Promoting entrepreneurship and job creation in underserved regions. Targeted investments in rural areas could help narrow interregional disparities.

4. Implementing progressive taxation and wealth redistribution policies to reduce the concentration of wealth among the elite.

5. Enhancing labor rights and collective bargaining power for workers to negotiate fair wages and benefits.

6. Increasing public spending on essential public goods and services like healthcare, infrastructure, and social services that benefit the broader population.

7. Addressing the root causes of inequality like inequitable land distribution and promoting agrarian reform.

8. Focusing on gender equality to break down barriers preventing women from participating fully in the workforce and economy.

Reducing inequality is not just a moral imperative - it's also crucial for sustainable economic growth and competitiveness. When everyone has a chance to thrive, the entire economy benefits. As the World Bank notes, ""no country has managed to make the transition to a middle-class society while maintaining high levels of inequality.""

The path forward requires a comprehensive approach combining economic policies, social programs, and institutional reforms. It demands political will, sustained commitment, and collaboration between government, civil society, and the private sector. 

By tackling income inequality head-on, the Philippines can create a more equitable society where every citizen has the opportunity to reach their full potential. The challenge is clear - now it's time for action to build a brighter future for all Filipinos.",1
27,Phind Instant,"Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) play a vital role in supporting the Philippine economy, with their remittances serving as a lifeline for countless families and driving economic growth. These modern-day heroes face numerous challenges abroad, yet continue to send billions of dollars back home each year.

According to recent data, OFWs sent a record $36.14 billion in remittances home in 2022 alone - a figure that represents about 10% of the country's GDP. This influx of foreign currency has become crucial for supporting consumer spending, which accounts for at least 75% of the Philippine economy.

However, behind these impressive statistics lies a complex reality. Many OFWs face difficult working conditions, long periods away from family, and risks of abuse and exploitation. Female workers, who make up approximately 60% of OFWs, are disproportionately affected by gender-based discrimination and violence.

The government has taken steps to protect OFWs, including issuing deployment bans for certain countries like Kuwait after high-profile cases of abuse. However, critics argue that these measures do not address the root causes of exploitation and do not provide long-term solutions.

To truly support OFWs and reduce our reliance on labor export, policymakers should focus on:

1. Creating more domestic job opportunities through industrialization and infrastructure development

2. Strengthening social protection programs for workers who choose to stay in the Philippines 

3. Improving education and skills training to increase employability at home

4. Promoting fair labor standards and addressing corruption in recruitment agencies

5. Enhancing diplomatic efforts with host countries to improve working conditions

While OFW remittances have been a crucial economic lifeline during difficult times, we cannot continue to rely solely on exporting our workforce. It's time to build a more equitable economy that provides opportunities for all Filipinos to thrive at home as well as abroad.

The sacrifices made by OFWs deserve recognition and appreciation. As we move forward, let us work towards creating a future where every Filipino can live and work with dignity - both here and overseas.",1
28,Phind Instant,"Food security remains a pressing concern for the Philippines, with millions of Filipinos struggling to access adequate, nutritious food. Recent data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization indicates that 5.3 million Filipinos were severely food insecure between 2019-2021, while another 48 million experienced moderate or severe food insecurity. This highlights the urgent need for comprehensive action to address this critical issue.

Several factors contribute to the Philippines' vulnerability to food insecurity:

1. Reliance on imported food: With the largest food trade deficit in Southeast Asia (around -2% of GDP), the Philippines heavily depends on imports to feed its population. This makes it vulnerable to global supply shocks and price fluctuations [5].

2. Limited domestic production: Despite efforts to boost agricultural productivity, the country still struggles with low yields and inefficient farming practices in many areas. Infrastructure gaps between farmers and markets further hinder domestic food production [5].

3. Climate change impacts: Rising temperatures and more frequent natural disasters threaten crop yields and fisheries, potentially exacerbating food shortages in the future.

4. Income inequality: The concentration of land ownership among a few large landholders limits opportunities for small farmers and rural communities to participate in agriculture and improve their livelihoods [3].

To address these challenges and improve food security, policymakers should consider several key strategies:

1. Invest in agricultural infrastructure: Improving roads, storage facilities, and irrigation systems would help connect farmers to markets more efficiently.

2. Support small-scale farmers: Programs aimed at empowering small farmers, such as providing access to credit, training, and market linkages, could significantly boost domestic food production.

3. Promote sustainable agriculture: Encouraging practices like organic farming and agroforestry not only improves soil health but also enhances biodiversity and resilience to climate change.

4. Enhance social protection programs: Expanding cash transfer programs and other forms of support for vulnerable households could help them better cope with food price shocks.

5. Improve nutrition education: Educating consumers about balanced diets and proper food preparation could help maximize the nutritional value of available food resources.

6. Strengthen partnerships: Collaborating with international organizations and neighboring countries to share knowledge, technologies, and best practices in agriculture could accelerate progress.

7. Address land reform: Implementing genuine land reform to redistribute idle lands to small farmers could increase productivity and reduce inequality in the agricultural sector.

8. Invest in research and development: Supporting scientific research on crop improvement, pest management, and climate-resilient agriculture could lead to breakthroughs in increasing yields and reducing post-harvest losses.

9. Enhance food waste reduction efforts: Initiatives to reduce food waste throughout the supply chain could help make existing resources go further.

10. Improve data collection and monitoring: Better tracking of food security indicators and early warning systems would allow for more timely interventions when needed.

Food security is not just an economic issue, but a matter of human rights and dignity. Every Filipino deserves access to nutritious food regardless of income level or geographic location. By implementing these strategies and demonstrating political will, we can move closer to achieving the goal of zero hunger and ensuring that no Filipino goes to bed hungry.

The path forward requires collaboration between government agencies, civil society organizations, private sector companies, and individual citizens. Together, we can build a more resilient food system that benefits all Filipinos and contributes to national development.",1
29,Phind Instant,"The Philippines has made significant strides in embracing digital technologies, but challenges remain in ensuring equal access to these innovations across all segments of society. As we move forward with our digital transformation goals, it's crucial that we address the persistent gaps in technology accessibility that hinder full participation in the digital economy.

According to recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, only about 70% of Filipino households have internet access at home. This leaves nearly one-third of families without reliable digital connectivity, exacerbating existing inequalities in education, healthcare, and economic opportunities [3].

To bridge this digital divide and ensure technology is truly accessible to all Filipinos, policymakers should consider several key strategies:

1. Expand rural connectivity: Investing in infrastructure projects to bring high-speed internet to underserved areas would greatly level the playing field for remote communities.

2. Improve digital literacy programs: Comprehensive training initiatives can help equip more Filipinos with the skills needed to effectively utilize technology.

3. Enhance government digital services: Making essential public services available online could help reduce barriers to access for those without reliable internet at home.

4. Promote affordable devices and data plans: Efforts to make smartphones and internet packages more affordable could increase adoption rates across income brackets.

5. Foster inclusive tech ecosystems: Supporting startups and innovations focused on accessibility could lead to solutions tailored to Filipino needs.

6. Strengthen cybersecurity measures: Protecting users from online threats is crucial for building trust in digital technologies.

7. Address digital infrastructure challenges: Upgrading outdated networks and improving data center capacity would support more robust digital services [4].

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated our reliance on digital technologies, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. While remote work and online learning became necessary adaptations, they also exposed vulnerabilities in our digital infrastructure and access to devices and internet connectivity [4].

As we move forward with our digital transformation goals, we must prioritize inclusivity and equity. This means not just expanding our digital capabilities, but ensuring that all Filipinos have the opportunity to benefit from technological advancements regardless of their location, income level, or background.

The path forward requires collaboration between government agencies, private sector companies, civil society organizations, and individual citizens. Together, we can build a more equitable digital ecosystem where every Filipino has access to the tools and opportunities that technology provides.

Let us seize this moment to create a truly connected Philippines – one where technology serves as a force multiplier for economic growth, social progress, and human development. By doing so, we can harness the full potential of digital technologies to build a brighter future for all Filipinos.",1
30,Phind Instant,"The Philippines, known for its vibrant democracy, faces ongoing challenges in ensuring equal participation in governance. However, a new generation of young Filipinos is emerging as a powerful force in reshaping the country's political landscape. Their energy, idealism, and technological savvy are bringing fresh perspectives to the table and pushing for much-needed reforms.

Recent data reveals that over 40% of Filipinos are under 18 years old, presenting a massive demographic that could either be a blessing or a curse for the country's future [1]. However, despite their numbers, youth participation in formal political structures has traditionally been limited. This disconnect between the young majority and political power has led to frustration and disillusionment among many young Filipinos.

But change is underway. Several initiatives are working to empower youth participation in Philippine politics:

1. The Sangguniang Kabataan (SK): Local youth councils in each of the country's 42,000 barangays, giving young people a voice in local governance [1].

2. The National Youth Commission: Serving as the main policymaking body on youth issues, coordinating all youth-related institutions and programs [1].

3. The Philippine Youth Development Plan: A guiding framework for youth development programs and policies, emphasizing active youth involvement in planning and implementing initiatives [1].

These structures provide platforms for young Filipinos to engage in decision-making processes and address local and national issues. However, challenges remain. Political dynasties continue to influence many areas, limiting opportunities for genuine youth representation [1]. Additionally, lack of consistent political support and insufficient funding have hindered the operationalization of some youth initiatives, particularly in remote regions [1].

Despite these obstacles, there are encouraging signs of progress:

1. Higher representation of women as Sangguniang Kabataan officials compared to adult counterparts, suggesting efforts to empower young women in leadership roles are yielding positive outcomes [1].

2. A relatively high number of young members of parliament, with 20 out of 311 MPs below 30 years old, earning the country top scores regionally and globally [1].

3. Successful implementation of reforms aimed at strengthening meaningful youth participation, such as the SK Reform Law passed in 2015 [1].

As we move forward, it's crucial that policymakers recognize the potential of this demographic dividend. By investing in education, skills training, and civic engagement programs, we can harness the energy and creativity of young Filipinos to drive sustainable economic growth and social progress.

Moreover, technology is playing a crucial role in bridging the gap between youth and politics. Social media platforms have enabled young Filipinos to mobilize, organize, and raise awareness on issues affecting their generation [1].

However, this digital divide remains a significant challenge. Only about 70% of Filipino households have internet access at home, leaving nearly one-third without reliable digital connectivity [1]. Addressing this inequality in technology access could be crucial for leveling the playing field and ensuring equal participation in the digital economy.

In conclusion, while challenges persist, the youth of the Philippines are showing remarkable resilience and determination to shape their country's future. Their involvement in politics is not just a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for the country's continued progress. As we move forward, let us work towards creating a truly inclusive democracy where every Filipino, regardless of age, has the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our governance systems.",1
31,GPT4o-mini,"Income inequality is one of the most pressing issues in the Philippines, a country often lauded for its economic growth in recent years. Despite being one of Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economies, the benefits of growth have not been evenly distributed. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, highlighting the structural inequalities that have long plagued the nation. From disparities in wealth distribution to limited access to opportunities, income inequality has profound social, economic, and political implications for the country.

A Historical Perspective on Inequality
The roots of income inequality in the Philippines can be traced back to its colonial past. Under Spanish rule, vast tracts of land were concentrated in the hands of a few elite families, creating a feudal system where wealth and power were inherited rather than earned. This inequitable distribution of land and resources persisted through American colonization and into the modern era, where economic power remains concentrated among a small group of families and conglomerates.

Today, the top 1% of the population controls a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth. A study by Credit Suisse revealed that the richest Filipinos own nearly a third of the country's total wealth, while millions of Filipinos live below the poverty line. This concentration of wealth perpetuates a cycle of privilege, where access to quality education, healthcare, and job opportunities is reserved for the affluent.

The Urban-Rural Divide
Income inequality in the Philippines is also starkly reflected in the divide between urban and rural areas. Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao serve as economic hubs, attracting investments and offering higher wages. In contrast, many rural areas remain underdeveloped, with residents reliant on subsistence farming or low-paying informal jobs. The lack of infrastructure, limited access to markets, and inadequate government support further exacerbate rural poverty.

Agriculture, once the backbone of the Philippine economy, has been left behind in favor of industrial and service sectors. Farmers often struggle with outdated tools, insufficient capital, and vulnerability to climate change. The sector's decline has pushed many rural Filipinos to migrate to urban centers in search of better opportunities, leading to overcrowding in cities and the proliferation of informal settlements.

Education: The Great Equalizer?
Education is often cited as the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, but in the Philippines, access to quality education is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status. Public schools, while accessible, are often underfunded and overcrowded, leaving students at a disadvantage compared to their peers in private institutions. The cost of tertiary education further limits opportunities for low-income families, perpetuating the cycle of inequality.

According to a report by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), individuals with higher educational attainment are more likely to secure well-paying jobs. However, the lack of access to quality education in rural and marginalized communities prevents many Filipinos from climbing the socioeconomic ladder. This highlights the need for targeted investments in education, particularly in underprivileged areas, to create a level playing field for all.

Employment and Wage Disparities
Employment is another critical factor contributing to income inequality. While the country has seen improvements in employment rates, many Filipinos remain in low-paying and precarious jobs. The informal sector, which includes street vendors, tricycle drivers, and small-scale entrepreneurs, accounts for a significant portion of the workforce. These workers often lack job security, social protection, and opportunities for upward mobility.

Even within formal employment, wage disparities persist. Workers in urban areas earn significantly more than those in rural areas, and men typically earn higher wages than women. The minimum wage, which varies by region, is often insufficient to cover the rising cost of living, forcing many families to take on multiple jobs or rely on remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).

The Role of Government Policies
The government has introduced various policies and programs aimed at reducing income inequality, but their effectiveness has been limited. Conditional cash transfer programs like the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) have provided financial assistance to low-income families, enabling them to access education and healthcare. While these initiatives have helped alleviate poverty for some, they are not enough to address the root causes of inequality.

Tax reform is another area where the government has made strides. The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, implemented in 2018, aimed to make the tax system more equitable by lowering income taxes for low- and middle-income earners and increasing taxes on luxury goods and sugary beverages. However, critics argue that the law's regressive effects, such as higher fuel prices, have disproportionately affected the poor.

To truly address income inequality, the government must adopt a more comprehensive approach. This includes investing in rural development, expanding access to quality education and healthcare, and creating policies that promote inclusive growth. Strengthening labor protections and implementing a living wage can also help ensure that economic gains are shared more equitably.

The Social and Political Implications
Income inequality has far-reaching consequences for Philippine society. Economically, it hampers growth by limiting the purchasing power of a significant portion of the population. Socially, it fosters resentment and divides communities, creating a sense of hopelessness among the marginalized. Politically, it undermines trust in institutions and fuels populism, as people turn to leaders who promise quick fixes to systemic problems.

The 2022 elections highlighted the role of inequality in shaping political outcomes. Candidates who addressed issues of poverty and inequality resonated with voters, particularly in rural areas. However, translating campaign promises into meaningful action requires political will and a commitment to long-term reforms.

A Call to Action
Addressing income inequality in the Philippines is not an easy task, but it is essential for achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. The government, private sector, and civil society must work together to create a more equitable society where every Filipino has the opportunity to succeed. This requires bold policies, targeted investments, and a commitment to social justice.

By prioritizing education, rural development, and social protection, the Philippines can bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. Empowering marginalized communities, fostering inclusive economic growth, and promoting equitable resource distribution are crucial steps toward a more just and prosperous future. The fight against income inequality is a collective effort, and it is one that the nation cannot afford to lose.

32,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is often referred to as a nation of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). With over 1.83 million Filipinos working abroad as of 2022, OFWs are celebrated for their immense contributions to the country's economy. Their remittances are a cornerstone of the Philippine economy, sustaining millions of families and providing critical support to national development. However, while OFWs are hailed as modern-day heroes, their struggles and the deeper implications of their migration expose the vulnerabilities in the country’s economic framework.

The Economic Impact of OFW Remittances
Remittances from OFWs are among the Philippines' most vital sources of income. In 2022, personal remittances reached $36.14 billion, accounting for roughly 9% of the country's GDP. These funds bolster household consumption, enabling families to afford food, education, healthcare, and housing. Remittances also help stabilize the peso, enhance foreign exchange reserves, and provide a cushion during economic downturns, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For many families, remittances are a lifeline. They help break the cycle of poverty, allowing children to stay in school and ensuring access to better healthcare. On a larger scale, remittances fund local businesses, creating jobs and stimulating economic activity in communities across the Philippines.

However, while these benefits are undeniable, the country's dependence on OFW remittances raises critical questions about long-term sustainability. The Philippines risks relying too heavily on labor exportation as a development strategy rather than focusing on building a robust domestic economy.

The Socioeconomic Cost of Labor Migration
While OFWs contribute significantly to the economy, the personal cost of migration is often steep. Many OFWs leave their families behind, sacrificing years of presence to secure financial stability. The social impact of this separation can be profound, particularly on children who grow up without one or both parents. Studies have shown that these children are more prone to emotional and behavioral issues, despite the financial advantages provided by remittances.

OFWs also face challenges abroad, including exploitative working conditions, racial discrimination, and limited labor rights. Reports of abuse, particularly among domestic workers in the Middle East, highlight the vulnerabilities of Filipino migrants in foreign lands. Despite their invaluable contributions, OFWs often endure hardships that reveal the harsh realities of labor migration.

The Brain Drain Phenomenon
One of the unintended consequences of large-scale labor migration is the phenomenon of ""brain drain."" Many of the country's skilled professionals, including nurses, engineers, and teachers, seek better opportunities abroad due to higher wages and improved working conditions. While their remittances benefit the economy, their absence creates a talent gap in critical sectors, particularly healthcare and education.

For instance, the exodus of Filipino nurses to countries like the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom has strained the local healthcare system. Hospitals face chronic staff shortages, particularly in rural areas, where the need for medical professionals is greatest. This dynamic highlights the double-edged sword of labor migration: while it alleviates poverty for individual families, it often leaves domestic industries struggling to fill critical roles.

Government Policies and Labor Exportation
The Philippine government has institutionalized labor migration through agencies like the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA). These organizations are tasked with regulating overseas employment, protecting migrant workers’ rights, and providing welfare services.

However, critics argue that the government’s reliance on labor exportation is a band-aid solution to deeper economic issues. Instead of creating sufficient job opportunities and ensuring decent wages domestically, the government has leaned on OFW remittances to sustain the economy. This reliance underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to economic development that prioritizes local job creation and industrialization.

Efforts have been made to improve the welfare of OFWs, such as the passage of the ""Migrant Workers Act"" and the establishment of the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW). These initiatives aim to provide greater protection and support for Filipino workers abroad. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure the safety, dignity, and rights of OFWs in their host countries.

OFWs and the Philippine Middle Class
Remittances from OFWs have played a significant role in the emergence of the Philippine middle class. Many OFW families use their earnings to invest in education, small businesses, and real estate, contributing to upward social mobility. This has had a ripple effect on consumer spending, driving demand for goods and services and spurring growth in sectors like retail and real estate.

However, the middle class's growth has also exposed structural inequalities. While some families benefit from remittances, others remain trapped in poverty due to limited access to opportunities. The uneven distribution of wealth underscores the need for inclusive policies that address income inequality and create a level playing field for all Filipinos.

The Path to Sustainable Development
The Philippines must find a way to reduce its dependence on labor exportation while leveraging the benefits of OFW contributions. This requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses both the push and pull factors of migration.

Job Creation and Economic Diversification: The government must prioritize creating quality jobs at home. Investments in manufacturing, technology, and agriculture can provide sustainable employment and reduce the need for Filipinos to seek work abroad.

Improving Domestic Wages and Working Conditions: Many Filipinos migrate due to low wages and poor working conditions. By implementing policies that ensure fair wages, labor protections, and benefits, the government can make domestic employment more attractive.

Investing in Education and Skills Development: Equipping Filipinos with the skills needed for high-demand industries, both locally and globally, can enhance their earning potential and reduce reliance on low-skilled labor migration.

Supporting Return Migrants: Programs that help returning OFWs reintegrate into society and utilize their savings and skills for entrepreneurship can create a multiplier effect in the economy.

Strengthening OFW Protections: While migration remains a reality, the government must continue to advocate for the rights and welfare of Filipino workers abroad. Bilateral agreements with host countries and stronger enforcement of anti-abuse measures are critical.

A Nation of Heroes
OFWs are often called modern-day heroes for a reason. Their sacrifices and hard work sustain millions of Filipino families and contribute significantly to the national economy. However, their stories also reveal the systemic issues that need to be addressed for the Philippines to achieve sustainable and inclusive development.

The challenge lies in creating a society where Filipinos no longer feel compelled to leave their families and country in search of better opportunities. By addressing the root causes of labor migration and building a resilient domestic economy, the Philippines can honor the contributions of OFWs while paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.",1
33,GPT4o-mini,"Food security—the ability of a population to have consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food—is a fundamental human right and an essential foundation for national development. However, in the Philippines, achieving food security has remained a persistent challenge. Despite being an agricultural country with fertile lands and abundant marine resources, the nation continues to grapple with issues such as rising food prices, dependency on imports, and climate-related vulnerabilities. As the country faces these hurdles, it is clear that ensuring food security is both a pressing need and a multifaceted challenge that demands immediate and long-term solutions.

The Current State of Food Security in the Philippines
According to the 2022 Global Hunger Index, the Philippines ranks in the ""serious"" hunger category, reflecting the nation's struggle to provide adequate food for its population. Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reveals that approximately 24% of Filipino families experience food insecurity, a number that has only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, when supply chain disruptions and unemployment drastically reduced access to food.

The Philippine economy has shown remarkable resilience, but the agricultural sector, which should be a cornerstone of food security, has not kept pace with the country's growing population. Agricultural productivity remains stagnant, and the sector accounts for only 9% of the gross domestic product (GDP), despite employing nearly 25% of the workforce. This mismatch underscores the inefficiencies and structural issues within the sector.

Dependency on Food Imports: A Double-Edged Sword
One of the most concerning aspects of food security in the Philippines is its heavy reliance on food imports. Rice, a staple food for Filipinos, is a prime example. While the Philippines is one of the world's largest rice consumers, it has consistently struggled to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production. Instead, it relies on imports from countries such as Vietnam and Thailand to meet its domestic demand.

This dependency on imports leaves the country vulnerable to external shocks, such as rising global food prices and trade restrictions. For instance, the ongoing geopolitical tensions and global supply chain disruptions have caused significant spikes in the cost of imported goods, further straining the budgets of Filipino households. While the government has implemented policies to stabilize rice prices, such as the Rice Tariffication Law, these measures have had mixed results, with some farmers struggling to compete with cheaper imported rice.

Climate Change: A Growing Threat
The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, frequently hit by typhoons, droughts, and other climate-related events. These natural disasters devastate crops, disrupt food supply chains, and exacerbate food insecurity. Typhoon Odette (Rai) in 2021, for example, caused significant damage to agricultural lands, affecting millions of Filipinos' access to food.

Climate change amplifies these challenges. Rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns disrupt planting and harvesting schedules, reduce crop yields, and increase the prevalence of pests and diseases. Coastal communities, which rely on fishing for their livelihoods, are also severely affected by rising sea levels and declining fish stocks due to overfishing and marine pollution.

The Role of Government Policies
The Philippine government has launched numerous initiatives to address food security, but their effectiveness has been mixed. Programs like the ""Plant, Plant, Plant"" initiative, introduced during the pandemic, aimed to boost local food production by encouraging backyard gardening and urban agriculture. While these efforts have had localized successes, they are insufficient to address systemic issues.

The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) was another ambitious policy aimed at redistributing agricultural land to farmers. However, it has been criticized for poor implementation and lack of support for beneficiaries. Many farmers who received land titles under CARP lack access to credit, technology, and infrastructure, leaving them unable to maximize productivity.

Urbanization and Its Impact on Agriculture
Rapid urbanization has further complicated the Philippines' food security. As cities expand, agricultural lands are being converted into residential and commercial spaces. This trend not only reduces the land available for food production but also displaces farming communities, pushing them into poverty and food insecurity.

Metro Manila, for instance, has become heavily reliant on food supplies from neighboring provinces. This dependency creates logistical challenges, particularly during natural disasters or pandemics, when transportation and supply chains are disrupted.

Addressing Food Security: A Multi-Sectoral Approach
Ensuring food security in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. Here are some key strategies:

Investing in Agricultural Development
Increasing investments in the agricultural sector is crucial. This includes providing farmers with access to modern technology, improving irrigation systems, and expanding access to affordable credit. Research and development in climate-resilient crops and sustainable farming practices should also be prioritized.

Promoting Sustainable Practices
Sustainable farming and fishing practices are essential for long-term food security. Initiatives to reduce overfishing, combat marine pollution, and promote organic farming can help protect the country's natural resources and ensure their sustainability for future generations.

Strengthening Local Food Systems
Encouraging local food production through urban agriculture and community-supported farming initiatives can reduce reliance on imports and create more resilient food systems. Government programs should focus on empowering small-scale farmers and fisherfolk, who are often the most vulnerable to food insecurity.

Enhancing Climate Resilience
To mitigate the impacts of climate change, the government should invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant irrigation systems and typhoon-resistant storage facilities. Early warning systems and disaster risk reduction programs can also help protect agricultural communities.

Improving Food Distribution and Logistics
Efficient food distribution systems are critical for reducing food waste and ensuring that food reaches all regions of the country. Investments in transportation infrastructure, cold storage facilities, and digital platforms for supply chain management can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Addressing Poverty and Inequality
Tackling food insecurity requires addressing its root causes, particularly poverty and inequality. Social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, can help vulnerable families access food, while job creation and inclusive economic growth can provide long-term solutions.

The Role of the Private Sector and Civil Society
The private sector and civil society also play a critical role in addressing food security. Private companies can invest in agricultural innovation, create market opportunities for small-scale farmers, and adopt sustainable practices. Civil society organizations can advocate for policy reforms, provide technical assistance to farmers, and raise awareness about food security issues.

A Call to Action
Food security is not just a matter of economic growth or agricultural output; it is a matter of human dignity and national stability. The Philippines has the potential to overcome its food security challenges, but doing so requires collective action from the government, private sector, and civil society.

As the country moves forward, it must prioritize policies and programs that address the root causes of food insecurity while building a more sustainable and resilient food system. The goal should not just be to feed the nation but to nourish it, ensuring that every Filipino has access to the food they need to lead healthy and productive lives.

The time to act is now. Ensuring food security is not just an economic imperative—it is a moral one. By working together, the Philippines can build a future where no one goes hungry, and every Filipino can enjoy the benefits of a truly food-secure nation.",1
34,GPT4o-mini,"The Accessibility of Technology in the Philippines: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities

In recent years, the Philippines has made significant strides in technological adoption and digital transformation. With a population of over 110 million people, the demand for accessible and affordable technology has grown exponentially. From mobile connectivity to digital finance and e-governance, the accessibility of technology in the country has reshaped how Filipinos interact, work, and live. However, despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in bridging the digital divide, ensuring affordability, and improving infrastructure.

The State of Digital Penetration in the Philippines

The Philippines boasts one of the highest internet penetration rates in Southeast Asia, with nearly 76 million Filipinos active online. Mobile technology has been at the forefront of this connectivity, with an estimated 152 million mobile connections as of 2023. This mobile-first culture has allowed many citizens to bypass traditional infrastructure constraints and connect to the internet through affordable smartphones and prepaid data plans.

However, the country's digital progress is uneven, with urban centers such as Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao enjoying better connectivity and access compared to rural and remote areas. In these less-developed regions, poor network coverage, slow internet speeds, and high costs hinder digital inclusion.

Challenges in Technology Accessibility

Infrastructure Gaps:
Despite government and private sector efforts, the Philippines continues to grapple with inadequate telecommunications infrastructure. The country's archipelagic nature presents logistical challenges in laying down fiber-optic cables and establishing cell towers, leading to connectivity issues in geographically isolated areas.

Affordability Concerns:
For many Filipinos, the cost of devices and internet services remains a significant barrier to technological access. While affordable smartphone options exist, the high cost of mobile data relative to average income levels can make sustained connectivity a challenge for low-income households.

Digital Literacy:
While many Filipinos own smartphones, a significant portion of the population lacks the digital skills necessary to fully leverage technology for productivity and economic growth. Digital literacy programs are needed to educate users on topics such as online safety, e-commerce, and basic IT skills.

Policy and Regulation Issues:
Bureaucratic red tape and inconsistent policies have slowed down efforts to expand connectivity. Delays in granting permits for cell tower construction and spectrum allocation have hampered the efforts of telecom companies to improve their services.

Opportunities for Improvement

Despite these challenges, the Philippines presents numerous opportunities to improve technological accessibility and inclusivity.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):
Collaboration between the government and private sector players can accelerate the rollout of digital infrastructure. Initiatives such as the ""Free Wi-Fi for All"" project by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) aim to provide internet access to underserved areas through public Wi-Fi hotspots.

5G Expansion:
The introduction of 5G technology presents an opportunity to revolutionize connectivity in the Philippines. Faster internet speeds and lower latency can support innovations in telemedicine, online education, and e-commerce, particularly in underserved communities.

Affordable Financing Options:
Telecom companies and financial institutions can work together to provide installment plans and microfinancing solutions that make smartphones and data plans more accessible to lower-income individuals.

Community-Based Digital Training:
NGOs and educational institutions can play a vital role in providing grassroots-level training programs that focus on digital literacy, helping bridge the knowledge gap and enabling Filipinos to participate fully in the digital economy.

Localized Solutions:
Technology companies can develop localized apps and platforms that cater to the unique needs of Filipino users, such as content in local languages, financial inclusion tools, and services tailored for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

The Role of Government Initiatives

The Philippine government has taken proactive steps to improve technological accessibility, recognizing its importance for economic growth and social development. Initiatives such as the National Broadband Plan (NBP) aim to expand internet coverage and lower costs by developing a national fiber optic backbone. Meanwhile, the recently passed SIM Card Registration Act and the push for digital ID systems under the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) are steps towards enhancing cybersecurity and streamlining access to online services.

Conclusion

The accessibility of technology in the Philippines is a story of both remarkable progress and persistent challenges. While millions of Filipinos have embraced the digital age, gaps in infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy continue to hinder full inclusion. To ensure that all Filipinos can reap the benefits of digital transformation, a concerted effort from the government, private sector, and civil society is needed. With strategic investments and targeted policies, the Philippines has the potential to bridge the digital divide and create a more inclusive and connected future for all its citizens.",1
35,GPT4o-mini,"The youth of the Philippines have long been considered the hope of the nation. As inheritors of the country's future, they play a pivotal role in shaping its political landscape. In recent years, the involvement of young Filipinos in political discourse, activism, and governance has grown significantly, reflecting their desire to create meaningful change. Their influence extends beyond traditional political avenues, embracing digital platforms and grassroots movements to drive social and political transformation.

Historical Involvement of Filipino Youth in Politics

Throughout Philippine history, the youth have been instrumental in key political movements. The Katipunan, a secret revolutionary society that fought against Spanish colonization, was founded by young revolutionaries like Andres Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto. Decades later, during the Martial Law era in the 1970s, student activists courageously voiced their opposition to the Marcos dictatorship, organizing protests and demanding democratic reforms.

Fast forward to the present day, and the Filipino youth continue to wield significant political influence. The 2016 and 2022 national elections saw record-breaking youth voter registration and participation, highlighting their increasing interest in shaping the country's leadership and policies.

The Digital Revolution and Political Awareness

One of the most profound ways in which the youth have influenced Philippine politics is through digital platforms. Social media has become a powerful tool for political engagement, enabling young Filipinos to stay informed, share their views, and mobilize others. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become battlegrounds for political discourse, fact-checking, and advocacy.

Digital activism has empowered the youth to challenge misinformation, hold leaders accountable, and push for transparency in governance. Online campaigns addressing issues such as climate change, corruption, and human rights violations have gained traction, often leading to real-world actions and policy discussions.

Youth Participation in Governance

Beyond social media activism, young Filipinos are increasingly entering the realm of governance and policymaking. Youth-led organizations and initiatives have emerged to bridge the gap between government and the younger generation. The Sangguniang Kabataan (SK), a youth council within local government units, serves as an avenue for young leaders to engage in public service and policymaking.

While the SK has faced criticism for inefficiency and corruption, recent reforms aim to improve its credibility and effectiveness. With proper guidance and genuine commitment, the youth can harness the potential of the SK to address community issues and advocate for meaningful policies.

Challenges Facing the Youth in Political Engagement

Despite their enthusiasm and potential, the youth face numerous challenges in their political involvement. Misinformation, political disillusionment, and economic constraints often hinder their ability to engage effectively. Some young Filipinos feel discouraged by systemic corruption and the perception that their voices are not being heard.

Additionally, the commercialization of politics and the prevalence of traditional political dynasties present barriers to genuine youth representation. Overcoming these challenges requires sustained efforts in political education, capacity-building, and the promotion of youth-centric policies.

The Way Forward: Empowering the Filipino Youth

To maximize the impact of youth in shaping Philippine politics, various stakeholders must collaborate in fostering an environment that nurtures their political engagement. Schools and universities should strengthen civic education programs, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to critically analyze political issues and engage in constructive dialogue.

Moreover, policymakers and civil society organizations must create more platforms for youth participation in decision-making processes. Encouraging mentorship programs, youth summits, and policy dialogues can help bridge the gap between young people and political leaders.

Lastly, the youth themselves must continue to embrace their role as catalysts for change. Whether through activism, public service, or community involvement, their collective efforts can drive the Philippines toward a more inclusive and progressive political landscape.

Conclusion

The Filipino youth are not just the future of the nation; they are its present. Their growing influence in shaping Philippine politics is a testament to their passion, resilience, and commitment to a better tomorrow. With their continued engagement and empowerment, they hold the power to transform the country's political system and pave the way for a more just and democratic society.",1
36,Llama3.2,"As one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, the Philippines has been touted as a beacon of hope for economic development and prosperity. However, beneath its impressive GDP growth rate lies a stark reality that has left millions of Filipinos struggling to make ends meet. The country's income inequality crisis is a ticking time bomb, threatening to destabilize social cohesion and undermine the very foundations of democracy.

The numbers are alarming. According to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country's Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, has been steadily increasing over the past two decades. In 2020, it reached a staggering 40.3, ranking the Philippines alongside South Africa and Brazil as one of the most unequal countries in the world. This means that nearly half of the population lives below the poverty line, with many more struggling to survive on meager incomes.

The effects of income inequality are far-reaching and devastating. Families are torn apart as parents sacrifice their own well-being for the sake of their children, who often drop out of school or enter the workforce at an early age to support their families. Communities are fragmented, with the rich and powerful wielding disproportionate influence over local politics and development projects.

The root causes of income inequality in the Philippines are complex and multifaceted. One major factor is the country's labor market, which has been driven by a series of neoliberal reforms that prioritize foreign investment and economic growth over social welfare and job security. The resulting ""gig economy"" has created an army of precarious workers who are denied basic rights and protections.

Another significant contributor to income inequality is the Philippines' skewed distribution of wealth. According to a report by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the country's wealthiest 10% hold over 30% of its total wealth, while the bottom 40% have less than 1%. This concentration of wealth has been fueled by decades of crony capitalism and corruption, which has allowed a small elite to accumulate vast fortunes at the expense of the majority.

The government's response to income inequality has been woefully inadequate. While President Rodrigo Duterte has made some token gestures towards social welfare and poverty reduction, his administration's focus on economic growth and infrastructure development has largely ignored the needs of the most vulnerable segments of society.

In recent years, there have been calls for a more radical approach to addressing income inequality in the Philippines. Some advocates have proposed a wealth tax or inheritance tax to redistribute wealth and fund social programs. Others have suggested implementing a universal basic income (UBI) to ensure that every citizen has access to a minimum standard of living.

However, such proposals are often met with fierce resistance from politicians and business leaders who see them as threats to economic growth and stability. The Philippines is a major recipient of foreign investment, and its government has been reluctant to implement policies that might alienate potential investors or stifle economic development.

As the global conversation around income inequality continues to grow, it is clear that the Philippines cannot afford to ignore this crisis any longer. The country needs a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of poverty and inequality, while also promoting inclusive growth and social welfare. This requires a fundamental transformation of its economic policies and institutions, as well as a renewed commitment to social justice and human rights.

One potential solution is the implementation of progressive taxation, which would shift the burden of taxation from the poor and middle class to the wealthy elite. Another approach could be to increase access to education and job training programs, which would enable more Filipinos to acquire skills and secure better-paying jobs.

Ultimately, addressing income inequality in the Philippines will require a sustained effort from government, civil society, and the private sector. It demands a willingness to challenge entrenched interests and power structures, while also promoting greater economic inclusivity and social cohesion.

As we look to the future, it is clear that the Philippines cannot afford to ignore its income inequality crisis any longer. The country has a unique opportunity to learn from other nations and pioneer new models of inclusive growth and poverty reduction. By working together, we can build a more just and equitable society for all Filipinos – where everyone has access to opportunities and resources to thrive.

37,Llama3.2,"As one of the world's top remittance-receiving countries, the Philippines has long been synonymous with the sacrifices made by its Overseas Foreign Workers (OFWs). These dedicated individuals have been the backbone of our economy for decades, sending home billions of pesos every year to support their families and loved ones back home. However, despite their immense contributions, OFWs continue to face unimaginable hardships and exploitation.

The Philippine government has often touted OFWs as a symbol of national pride, highlighting their dedication and resilience in the face of adversity. And while it is true that many OFWs embody these traits, it is equally important to acknowledge the numerous challenges they face on the job and back home.

One of the most significant issues affecting OFWs is the lack of adequate protection and support from their employers. Many OFWs are forced to work in hazardous conditions, with minimal benefits and no social security. They are often subjected to physical and emotional abuse, as well as exploitation by unscrupulous employers who take advantage of their vulnerability.

The Philippine government has implemented various measures to address these concerns, including the passage of the Migrant Workers Act of 2004 and the establishment of the Department of Labor and Employment's (DOLE) Migrant Workers Division. However, despite these efforts, many OFWs continue to suffer from poor working conditions and inadequate compensation.

Another critical issue affecting OFWs is the lack of access to quality healthcare and social services back home. Many OFWs face long waiting periods for medical treatment, and those who fall ill often have to rely on their families or charitable organizations for support.

The economic impact of OFWs cannot be overstated. According to a report by the World Bank, remittances from OFWs account for approximately 10% of the country's GDP, making them a crucial component of our economy. In fact, remittances have been instrumental in mitigating poverty and reducing income inequality in the Philippines.

However, despite their significance, OFWs often receive little to no credit for their contributions to the Philippine economy. Their sacrifices are frequently overlooked, and their earnings are often seen as mere pocket change by those who reap the benefits of their labor.

This oversight is particularly galling given the historical injustices faced by Filipino migrants abroad. For generations, Filipinos have been forced to seek employment in foreign lands, often under exploitative conditions. The United States, Japan, and other major economies have long exploited Filipino migrant laborers, denying them basic rights and protections.

In recent years, however, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of OFWs to our economy and society. The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives aimed at improving working conditions and providing support services for OFWs, including the establishment of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).

The private sector has also begun to take notice of the critical role OFWs play in our economy. Many companies have started to recognize the value of their migrant workers and are implementing measures to improve working conditions and provide better compensation.

As we look to the future, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being and rights of our OFWs. This requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of exploitation and neglect. It also demands greater recognition and appreciation for the sacrifices made by these dedicated individuals.

One potential solution is the implementation of stricter regulations on employers of migrant workers, including mandatory health checks and regular inspections to ensure compliance with labor laws. Another approach could be to increase access to quality healthcare and social services back home, particularly in rural areas where OFWs often reside.

Ultimately, addressing the plight of our OFWs requires a fundamental shift in how we view their contributions to our economy and society. We must recognize that these individuals are not just workers or sources of remittances; they are also human beings deserving of dignity, respect, and protection.

As the Philippines continues to grow and develop as an economy, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being and rights of our OFWs. By doing so, we can create a more just and equitable society where all individuals, regardless of their nationality or employment status, are treated with dignity and respect.

38,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, boasting some of the world's most fertile soil and diverse ecosystems. However, despite its natural endowments, the country is facing a growing crisis that threatens the very foundation of our national identity: food security.

Food security, defined as access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food at all times, is a fundamental human right. Yet, for millions of Filipinos, this right remains an unattainable dream. The Philippines ranks among the world's most food-insecure countries, with over 40% of the population relying on non-food cash income or other means to purchase basic necessities.

The root causes of our food insecurity are multifaceted and complex. Climate change is a major contributor, as rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters have led to reduced crop yields, decreased agricultural productivity, and disrupted food systems. The country's dependence on imported rice, for example, has become unsustainable due to the increasing costs associated with transportation, storage, and logistics.

Another significant factor is the Philippines' vulnerability to external shocks in the global market. Trade wars, price volatility, and supply chain disruptions have all taken a toll on our agricultural sector, making it difficult for farmers to maintain profitability and invest in sustainable practices.

Domestically, our food security situation is further complicated by inadequate policies and lack of investment in agriculture. The Philippine government's priorities have historically been skewed towards economic growth and infrastructure development, leaving the country's agricultural sector to fend for itself.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to address these challenges and prioritize food security as a national priority. The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting agricultural development, improving access to markets, and increasing support for small-scale farmers.

One notable example is the country's National Food Security Program (NFSP), launched in 2013 with the aim of increasing rice production and reducing import dependence. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done.

Another critical area is the need for climate-resilient agriculture. The Philippines is vulnerable to various types of natural hazards, including typhoons, droughts, and floods, which can have devastating impacts on agricultural productivity. Climate-smart agriculture practices, such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture, offer promising solutions that can help farmers adapt to these challenges.

However, despite these efforts, the Philippines still faces significant hurdles in achieving food security. One major challenge is the lack of access to basic services for small-scale farmers, including credit, extension services, and market information.

Moreover, our country's agricultural sector remains heavily reliant on monoculture farming practices, which can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices, such as permaculture and agroecology, is essential for building resilience in the face of climate change.

The solution to our food security crisis lies not just in policy or technology, but also in behavioral change. We need a cultural shift that prioritizes food sovereignty, recognizes the value of traditional farming practices, and promotes sustainable consumption patterns.

In conclusion, the Philippines' struggle for food security is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and collective action. By addressing our dependence on imported rice, investing in climate-resilient agriculture, and promoting sustainable food systems, we can build a more resilient and equitable food future for all Filipinos.

As we look to the future, it is essential that we engage in an open and inclusive dialogue with stakeholders across sectors – policymakers, farmers, researchers, and consumers. Together, we must chart a course that balances economic growth with social justice and environmental sustainability.

The Philippines' food security crisis is not just about meeting our basic needs; it's about preserving the country's rich cultural heritage and protecting its natural resources for future generations. By working together, we can create a more food-secure and sustainable future – one where every Filipino has access to nutritious, affordable, and locally produced food.",1
39,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is one of the most digitally advanced countries in Southeast Asia, boasting a growing middle class and a vibrant tech industry. However, despite its progress, the country still lags behind in terms of access to technology, particularly for rural communities.

In today's digital age, having access to technology is no longer a luxury but a necessity. It has become a key driver of economic growth, social mobility, and overall well-being. Yet, for millions of Filipinos, especially those living in rural areas, the internet remains a distant dream.

The digital divide in the Philippines is a stark reminder of the country's unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. While urban centers like Manila and Cebu have made significant strides in adopting technology, many rural communities remain disconnected from the digital world.

One of the primary reasons for this disconnect is the lack of infrastructure. Many rural areas lack access to reliable internet connectivity, making it difficult for residents to stay connected with family, friends, and businesses.

The government has implemented various initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide, including the creation of the Department of Science and Technology's (DOST) National Broadband Plan. However, these efforts have been slow to materialize, leaving many Filipinos frustrated and disappointed.

Another significant challenge is the lack of affordable technology. Many rural communities struggle to afford basic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, making it difficult for them to access online services.

The impact of this digital divide cannot be overstated. Rural communities are missing out on essential services such as online banking, e-commerce, and healthcare. They are also being left behind in the global economy, with limited opportunities for education, employment, and social mobility.

However, there is hope. The private sector has stepped up to fill the gap, with companies like Globe Telecom and PLDT launching initiatives aimed at increasing internet penetration and affordability in rural areas.

One notable example is Globe's ""Globe at Home"" program, which provides affordable internet access to rural communities. This initiative has already made a significant impact, with thousands of households now enjoying reliable internet connectivity for the first time.

Another promising development is the growth of mobile payments and digital wallets. Initiatives such as PayMaya and GCash have made it possible for Filipinos to access financial services online, increasing convenience and reducing transaction costs.

However, more needs to be done. The government must prioritize investments in rural infrastructure, including broadband networks, to ensure that everyone has access to reliable internet connectivity.

Additionally, there is a need for greater awareness about the importance of digital literacy. Many rural Filipinos lack basic computer skills, making it difficult for them to navigate online services and take advantage of new technologies.

In conclusion, the Philippines' digital divide is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. While progress has been made, much more needs to be done to ensure that everyone has access to technology, regardless of their location or socio-economic status.

As we move forward, it is essential that we prioritize investments in rural infrastructure and digital literacy programs. We must also work with the private sector to increase affordability and accessibility of technology.

By bridging the gap between urban and rural communities, we can create a smarter nation where everyone has access to the opportunities and services they need to thrive. It's time for the Philippines to become a leader in the digital age, and it starts with making our country more accessible to all Filipinos.

40,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is at a crossroads. As the country navigates the complexities of modern politics, it is clear that the youth will play a pivotal role in shaping its destiny. With over 60% of the population under the age of 30, young Filipinos are increasingly taking center stage in Philippine politics.

For decades, the Philippines has struggled with an aging leadership. The country's politicians have often been out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of younger generations. However, with the rise of social media and increased access to information, young Filipinos are now more empowered than ever to engage with politics and demand change.

One of the key drivers of this shift is the growth of youth activism in the Philippines. Organizations such as the Youth Against Corruption (YAC) and the Kabataan Partylist have become powerful voices in Philippine politics, advocating for issues such as climate change, education, and social justice.

Young Filipinos are also increasingly using social media to express their opinions and mobilize support for their causes. The hashtag #Election2019, which trended on Twitter during the 2019 presidential election, was a testament to the power of young people's activism.

However, despite these efforts, young Filipinos still face significant barriers when it comes to participating in politics. Many are excluded from the electoral process due to lack of registration or identification documents, while others may not have access to quality education or job opportunities that would allow them to pursue careers in public service.

To address these challenges, the government must prioritize initiatives that increase youth participation in politics. This includes expanding voter registration drives, improving access to education and job training programs, and increasing awareness about civic engagement and voting.

Another key strategy is to empower young Filipinos as leaders and decision-makers within their communities. This can be achieved through mentorship programs, leadership training, and opportunities for internships and volunteer work in government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The Philippines also needs to recognize the value of youth voices in policy-making. The country's current leadership often overlooks the concerns and opinions of younger generations, instead prioritizing the interests of established politicians and business leaders.

To change this narrative, the government must create more inclusive decision-making processes that incorporate diverse perspectives and age groups. This can be achieved through the establishment of youth-focused councils or advisory boards that provide input on key policy decisions.

Finally, young Filipinos need to take ownership of their own empowerment. They must demand greater representation in politics and government, and be willing to challenge the status quo when necessary.

In conclusion, the Philippines is at a critical juncture in its development as a country. As the youth population continues to grow and become more influential, it is imperative that policymakers recognize their value and empower them to shape the country's destiny.

By prioritizing initiatives that increase youth participation in politics, empowering young Filipinos as leaders and decision-makers, recognizing their value in policy-making, and taking ownership of their own empowerment, we can create a brighter future for all Filipinos. The future of Philippine politics is in the hands of young people – let us give them the tools and support they need to succeed.

41,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, a nation blessed with abundant natural resources and a vibrant culture, grapples with a persistent and deeply rooted issue: income inequality. This stark disparity in wealth distribution casts a long shadow over the country's social and economic landscape, hindering progress and undermining the promise of a prosperous future for all Filipinos.

A Nation Divided:

The gap between the rich and the poor in the Philippines is significant and widening. The Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality, consistently places the Philippines among the most unequal countries in Southeast Asia. This translates to a reality where a small segment of the population enjoys a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth, while a vast majority struggle to meet basic needs.

The consequences of this inequality are far-reaching and deeply concerning:

Poverty and Social Exclusion: Millions of Filipinos live in poverty, lacking access to basic necessities like food, clean water, and healthcare. This poverty cycle perpetuates itself, trapping families in a cycle of deprivation and limiting their opportunities for social and economic mobility.
Social Unrest and Instability: Extreme inequality fuels social unrest and instability. The frustration and resentment felt by the marginalized can manifest in various forms, from social protests and crime to political instability.
Limited Economic Growth: Inequality hinders economic growth. When a significant portion of the population lacks access to resources and opportunities, the overall economic potential of the nation remains unrealized.
Weakened Social Fabric: The widening gap between the rich and the poor erodes the social fabric of the nation. It fosters feelings of resentment, distrust, and division among citizens, undermining social cohesion and national unity.
Root Causes of Inequality:

Several factors contribute to the high levels of income inequality in the Philippines:

Unequal Access to Education: Quality education is crucial for social and economic mobility. However, access to quality education remains unequal, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and between the rich and the poor.
Limited Job Opportunities: While the Philippine economy has experienced growth, job creation has not kept pace with the rapidly growing population. This leads to high unemployment and underemployment rates, particularly among the youth and those with limited skills.
Land Reform Challenges: Despite decades of efforts, land reform remains an unfinished agenda. Many Filipino farmers continue to face challenges such as landlessness, low productivity, and limited access to markets, trapping them in poverty.
Corruption and Inefficient Governance: Corruption at all levels of government siphons off resources that could be used for social programs and infrastructure development, further exacerbating inequality.
Weak Social Safety Nets: The government's social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, while helpful, are often insufficient to address the complex needs of the most vulnerable populations.
Addressing the Challenge:

Tackling income inequality requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of the problem. Key strategies include:

Investing in Human Capital: Prioritizing investments in education, from early childhood development to higher education, is crucial. This includes improving access to quality education for all, expanding vocational training programs, and strengthening the skills of the workforce to meet the demands of the modern economy.
Promoting Inclusive Growth: Economic growth must be inclusive and benefit all sectors of society. This requires policies that support small and medium enterprises, promote rural development, and create decent jobs for all Filipinos.
Land Reform and Agrarian Reform: Implementing genuine land reform is essential to empower farmers and improve agricultural productivity. This includes providing farmers with secure land tenure, access to credit, and support for sustainable agricultural practices.
Strengthening Social Safety Nets: Expanding and improving social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, is crucial to protect the most vulnerable members of society from poverty and ensure their basic needs are met.
Good Governance and Transparency: Combating corruption and promoting good governance are essential to ensure that public resources are used effectively and efficiently for the benefit of all Filipinos.
Empowering Women and Marginalized Groups: Empowering women and marginalized groups, such as indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities, is crucial for reducing inequality and promoting social justice.
Conclusion:

Income inequality is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a sustained and concerted effort from the government, the private sector, and civil society. By addressing the root causes of inequality, investing in human capital, promoting inclusive growth, and strengthening social safety nets, the Philippines can build a more equitable and just society where all Filipinos have the opportunity to thrive.

This is not merely a social justice issue; it is an economic imperative. A more equitable society is a more stable and prosperous society. By tackling income inequality, the Philippines can unleash its full potential and build a brighter future for all its citizens.",1
42,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines stands as a testament to the global phenomenon of labor migration. Millions of Filipinos, known as Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), have left their homeland in search of better opportunities abroad. While their remittances have become a crucial lifeline for the Philippine economy, this reliance presents a complex paradox: progress fueled by a significant human cost.   

The Economic Lifeline:

OFW remittances constitute a substantial portion of the Philippine economy, surpassing even foreign direct investment. These funds directly impact household consumption, driving demand for goods and services, and contributing significantly to poverty reduction.

The Human Cost:

However, the economic benefits of OFW remittances come at a significant human cost. The prolonged separation of families can have profound social and emotional consequences, leading to strained relationships, broken families, and even the erosion of traditional family values. Children of OFWs often experience emotional distress, neglect, and difficulties in their social and academic development.   

The physical and emotional well-being of OFWs themselves is also a major concern. They face numerous challenges abroad, including exploitation, abuse, and discrimination. Issues such as unfair labor practices, wage theft, and even human trafficking remain prevalent despite government efforts to protect their rights. The psychological toll of living and working far from home, often under stressful conditions, can lead to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.   

Beyond Remittances: A Path Towards Sustainable Development

The Philippine government must shift its focus beyond mere reliance on remittances and strive towards creating a more sustainable and equitable economic model. This requires a multi-pronged approach:

Investing in Human Capital: Prioritizing investments in education and skills development is crucial to equip Filipinos with the necessary skills to compete in the global job market and create a more robust domestic economy.
Promoting Job Creation: The government must actively promote job creation within the Philippines through policies that encourage entrepreneurship, support small and medium enterprises, and invest in key sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and agriculture.   
Addressing Root Causes of Migration: Addressing the root causes of labor migration, such as poverty, unemployment, and inequality, is essential. This requires implementing effective social safety nets, improving access to quality healthcare and education, and promoting inclusive growth that benefits all sectors of society.
Protecting the Rights of OFWs: Strengthening the legal framework for the protection of OFWs' rights, ensuring their safety and well-being abroad, and providing effective mechanisms for addressing grievances are crucial.
Harnessing the Skills and Expertise of Returning OFWs: The government must implement programs to effectively reintegrate returning OFWs into the Philippine workforce, leveraging their skills and experience to contribute to national development.
Conclusion:

The phenomenon of OFW migration presents a complex challenge for the Philippines. While remittances have played a vital role in supporting the economy, it is crucial to recognize the human cost associated with this reliance. The government must strive to create a more sustainable and equitable economic model that reduces the need for Filipinos to seek employment abroad. By investing in human capital, promoting job creation, and protecting the rights of OFWs, the Philippines can harness the potential of its human resources while ensuring the well-being of its citizens both at home and abroad.",1

46,Copilot,"Income inequality remains a significant challenge in the Philippines, despite the country's notable economic growth over the past few decades. This editorial explores the causes, effects, and potential solutions to this pressing issue.

The State of Income Inequality
The Philippines has made substantial progress in reducing poverty, with the poverty rate falling from 49.2% in 1985 to 16.7% in 20181. However, income inequality remains high. The top 1% of earners capture 17% of the national income, while the bottom 50% share only 14%1. The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, was 42.3% in 2018, one of the highest in East Asia1.

Causes of Income Inequality
Several factors contribute to income inequality in the Philippines:

Educational Disparities: Access to quality education is uneven, with children from wealthier families having better opportunities to attend good schools and universities. This disparity leads to unequal job opportunities and income levels2.

Urban-Rural Divide: Economic development has been concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural regions behind. This urban-rural divide exacerbates income inequality as rural residents often have limited access to high-paying jobs and essential services3.

Political Culture: The political system in the Philippines often favors the elite, with policies and resources disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. This ""spoils system"" perpetuates inequality by maintaining the status quo4.

Labor Market Inefficiencies: Many workers are employed in low-paying, informal jobs with little job security or benefits. This situation is particularly prevalent in the agricultural sector, where a significant portion of the population is employed5.

Effects of Income Inequality
Income inequality has far-reaching consequences for the Philippines:

Economic Instability: High levels of inequality can lead to economic instability. When a large portion of the population has limited purchasing power, it can stifle economic growth and lead to social unrest2.

Social Progress: Inequality hampers social progress by limiting access to education, healthcare, and other essential services for the poor. This perpetuates a cycle of poverty and reduces social mobility2.

Health and Nutrition: Inequality affects health outcomes, with poorer households experiencing higher rates of malnutrition, stunting, and other health issues. This disparity can have long-term effects on the country's human capital2.

Intergenerational Poverty: Income inequality perpetuates intergenerational poverty, as children from low-income families have fewer opportunities to improve their socio-economic status2.

Potential Solutions
Addressing income inequality in the Philippines requires a multifaceted approach:

Improving Education Access and Quality: Expanding access to quality education, particularly in rural areas, is crucial. This includes investing in schools, training teachers, and providing scholarships for low-income students1.

Promoting Rural Development: Policies that support rural development, such as improving infrastructure, providing access to credit, and promoting agricultural productivity, can help bridge the urban-rural divide1.

Strengthening Social Protection: Expanding social protection programs, such as conditional cash transfers and unemployment benefits, can provide a safety net for the poor and reduce income inequality1.

Labor Market Reforms: Implementing labor market reforms to improve job security, increase wages, and provide benefits for informal workers can help reduce inequality5.

Political Reforms: Addressing the political culture that favors the elite is essential. This includes promoting transparency, reducing corruption, and ensuring that policies benefit all citizens, not just the wealthy4.

Conclusion
Income inequality in the Philippines is a complex issue with deep-rooted causes and significant effects on the country's socio-economic landscape. While progress has been made in reducing poverty, much work remains to be done to address inequality. By implementing comprehensive policies that improve education, promote rural development, strengthen social protection, reform the labor market, and address political inequalities, the Philippines can move towards a more equitable and prosperous future.",1
47,Copilot,"Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) have long been hailed as the modern-day heroes of the Philippines. Their contributions to the economy through remittances, as well as the social and cultural impacts of their work abroad, are profound. This editorial delves into the significance of OFWs, the challenges they face, and the policies that support them.

The Economic Impact of OFWs
OFWs play a crucial role in the Philippine economy. In 2022, remittances from OFWs reached a record high of $36.14 billion, accounting for approximately 9% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)1. These remittances are vital for many Filipino families, providing a stable source of income that supports household consumption, education, healthcare, and other essential needs.

The inflow of remittances also bolsters the country's foreign exchange reserves, helping to stabilize the Philippine peso and reduce the trade deficit2. This financial support is particularly important during economic downturns, as it provides a buffer against external shocks and helps maintain economic stability.

Social and Cultural Contributions
Beyond their economic impact, OFWs contribute significantly to the social and cultural fabric of the Philippines. They are often seen as symbols of resilience and sacrifice, enduring homesickness and challenging working conditions to provide for their families. This sense of duty and commitment has earned them the title of ""Bagong Bayani"" or ""New Heroes""1.

The remittances sent by OFWs are often used to improve the quality of life for their families, funding education, healthcare, and housing. This, in turn, helps to uplift entire communities and contributes to social development. Moreover, the skills and experiences gained by OFWs abroad can be valuable assets when they return to the Philippines, potentially leading to new business ventures and job creation3.

Challenges Faced by OFWs
Despite their significant contributions, OFWs face numerous challenges. Many work in low-status jobs with limited protections, making them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse1. Female OFWs, who make up a significant portion of the overseas workforce, are particularly at risk of gender-based discrimination and violence1.

The separation from their families also takes a toll on the mental and emotional well-being of OFWs and their loved ones. Children of OFWs often grow up without one or both parents, leading to potential social and psychological issues4.

Government Policies and Support
The Philippine government has implemented various policies and programs to support OFWs and protect their rights. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) regulates the deployment of Filipino workers abroad and ensures that they are provided with fair and safe working conditions4. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) offers welfare programs, including insurance, legal assistance, and repatriation services4.

Additionally, the government has established bilateral labor agreements with several countries to safeguard the rights of Filipino workers and ensure their well-being5. These agreements are crucial in addressing issues such as contract violations, non-payment of wages, and other forms of maltreatment.

Potential Solutions and Future Outlook
To further support OFWs and maximize their contributions to the economy, several measures can be taken:

Strengthening Legal Protections: Enhancing the enforcement of labor laws and bilateral agreements can help protect OFWs from exploitation and abuse. This includes providing legal assistance and support for those who face injustices abroad5.

Promoting Financial Literacy: Educating OFWs and their families about financial management can help them make better use of remittances, leading to long-term financial stability and investment in productive ventures2.

Encouraging Return Migration: Creating opportunities for OFWs to return and reintegrate into the local economy can harness their skills and experiences for national development. This includes offering incentives for entrepreneurship and job creation3.

Improving Social Services: Enhancing access to social services such as education, healthcare, and housing for the families of OFWs can mitigate the negative impacts of family separation and improve overall well-being4.

Conclusion
Overseas Filipino Workers are indispensable to the Philippine economy and society. Their remittances provide a lifeline for millions of families and contribute significantly to national economic stability. However, the challenges they face highlight the need for continued support and protection from the government and society. By addressing these challenges and implementing supportive policies, the Philippines can ensure that the contributions of OFWs are fully realized, leading to a more prosperous and equitable future for all.",1
48,Copilot,"Food security is a critical issue in the Philippines, affecting millions of Filipinos. Despite the country's rich agricultural resources, many households struggle to access sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. This editorial explores the state of food security in the Philippines, the factors contributing to food insecurity, and potential solutions to address this pressing issue.

The State of Food Security
The Philippines faces significant food security challenges. According to a United Nations report, nearly 51 million Filipinos experienced moderate or severe food insecurity between 2020 and 2022, the highest number in Southeast Asia1. This means that a substantial portion of the population does not have consistent access to adequate food, leading to widespread hunger and malnutrition.

The World Food Programme (WFP) reported that one in ten households in the Philippines is food insecure, with the poorest regions being the most affected2. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), Region VIII (Eastern Visayas), and Region XII (SOCCSKSARGEN) are among the most food-insecure areas, reflecting the deep-seated regional disparities in food access2.

Causes of Food Insecurity
Several factors contribute to food insecurity in the Philippines:

Natural Disasters: The Philippines is highly vulnerable to natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. These events can devastate agricultural production, disrupt food supply chains, and displace communities, exacerbating food insecurity3.

Climate Change: Climate change has led to more frequent and severe weather events, affecting crop yields and food production. Changes in rainfall patterns and rising temperatures also pose long-term threats to agricultural productivity4.

Economic Inequality: The uneven distribution of wealth in the Philippines means that the poorest households are disproportionately affected by food insecurity. Agricultural households, in particular, suffer from higher rates of food insecurity compared to non-agricultural households5.

Infrastructure Deficiencies: Inadequate infrastructure, such as poor road networks and limited access to markets, hampers the efficient distribution of food. This results in higher food prices and reduced availability of fresh produce in remote areas3.

Population Growth: Rapid population growth increases the demand for food, putting additional pressure on the country's agricultural resources and food supply systems3.

Effects of Food Insecurity
Food insecurity has far-reaching consequences for individuals and communities:

Health and Nutrition: Food insecurity leads to malnutrition, which can cause stunting, wasting, and other health issues, particularly among children. Malnutrition also weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to diseases1.

Economic Impact: Hunger and malnutrition reduce productivity and economic potential. Workers who are malnourished are less able to perform physically demanding tasks, which can hinder economic growth and development1.

Social Stability: Food insecurity can lead to social unrest and conflict, as communities compete for limited resources. It can also exacerbate existing inequalities and contribute to social tensions1.

Potential Solutions
Addressing food insecurity in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach:

Enhancing Agricultural Productivity: Investing in modern agricultural techniques, improving access to quality seeds and fertilizers, and providing training for farmers can boost agricultural productivity. This includes promoting sustainable farming practices to ensure long-term food security6.

Improving Infrastructure: Developing better road networks, storage facilities, and market access can enhance the efficiency of food distribution. This will help reduce food prices and increase the availability of fresh produce in remote areas6.

Strengthening Social Protection Programs: Expanding social protection programs, such as conditional cash transfers and food assistance, can provide immediate relief to food-insecure households. These programs should be designed to reach the most vulnerable populations7.

Promoting Climate Resilience: Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices and investing in disaster risk reduction can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on food security. This includes developing early warning systems and providing support for farmers affected by natural disasters6.

Encouraging Urban Agriculture: Promoting urban agriculture, such as community gardens and rooftop farming, can increase food production in urban areas. This can help reduce the reliance on rural agricultural production and improve food access for urban dwellers7.

Addressing Economic Inequality: Implementing policies that promote inclusive economic growth and reduce income inequality can help address the root causes of food insecurity. This includes improving access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities for marginalized communities5.

Conclusion
Food security is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and civil society. By addressing the underlying causes of food insecurity and implementing targeted interventions, the Philippines can move towards a more food-secure future. Ensuring that all Filipinos have access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food is not only a moral imperative but also essential for the country's long-term development and stability.",1
49,Copilot,"In an era where technology drives economic growth, social progress, and individual empowerment, ensuring access to digital tools and services is crucial. The Philippines, with its rapidly expanding digital landscape, faces significant challenges in making technology accessible to all its citizens. This editorial explores the current state of technology accessibility in the Philippines, the barriers that exist, and potential solutions to bridge the digital divide.

The State of Technology Accessibility
The Philippines has made notable strides in digital adoption. As of early 2024, there were 86.98 million internet users in the country, representing 73.6% of the population1. Additionally, 86.75 million Filipinos were active on social media, equating to 73.4% of the total population1. Mobile connectivity is also widespread, with 117.4 million cellular connections, nearly matching the total population1.

Despite these impressive numbers, significant disparities remain. Urban areas, particularly Metro Manila, enjoy high-speed internet and a variety of service providers, while many rural communities struggle with slow connections or lack of access altogether2. This urban-rural divide highlights the uneven distribution of digital resources and the need for targeted interventions.

Barriers to Technology Accessibility
Several factors contribute to the challenges of technology accessibility in the Philippines:

Economic Barriers: The cost of digital devices and internet services remains prohibitive for many Filipinos. While urban residents may afford smartphones and broadband connections, rural and low-income households often cannot3. This economic disparity limits their ability to participate in the digital economy.

Infrastructure Deficiencies: Inadequate infrastructure, such as poor road networks and limited electricity supply, hampers the deployment of digital technologies in remote areas2. Without reliable infrastructure, efforts to improve internet access and digital literacy are significantly constrained.

Digital Literacy: A lack of digital literacy is a significant barrier to technology adoption.

With the right policies and initiatives, the Philippines can harness the full potential of its vibrant population and pave the way for a more prosperous and equitable future.",1
50,Copilot,"The youth of the Philippines have always been a dynamic force in the country's political landscape. With a significant portion of the population under the age of 30, their influence is undeniable. This editorial explores the impact of Filipino youth on politics, the challenges they face, and the potential they hold for the future of the nation.

The Demographic Power of Youth
The Philippines is a youthful nation. As of 2022, more than half of the country's 65.7 million registered voters were between the ages of 18 and 411. This demographic power means that the youth have a substantial say in the outcome of elections and the direction of the country's political future. Their sheer numbers make them a critical constituency that politicians cannot afford to ignore.

Youth Engagement in Politics
Youth engagement in politics takes many forms, from voting and campaigning to activism and policy advocacy. The 2022 national elections saw a significant increase in youth participation, with many young Filipinos registering to vote for the first time1. This surge in political engagement was driven by a desire for change and a recognition of the power of their collective voice.

Social media has played a pivotal role in mobilizing the youth. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become arenas for political discourse, where young people share information, debate issues, and organize movements2. The digital landscape has democratized political participation, allowing even those in remote areas to engage in national conversations.

Challenges Faced by Youth in Politics
Despite their potential, Filipino youth face several challenges in the political arena:

Political Dynasties: The prevalence of political dynasties in the Philippines often stifles new voices and ideas. Young candidates without family connections or significant financial backing find it difficult to compete against established political families3.

Misinformation and Fake News: The spread of misinformation and fake news on social media platforms poses a significant challenge. Young voters, who are highly active online, are particularly vulnerable to misleading information, which can influence their political choices1.

Economic Barriers: Economic challenges also hinder youth participation in politics. Many young Filipinos are preoccupied with securing their livelihoods, leaving little time or resources for political engagement3.

Lack of Political Education: There is a need for more comprehensive political education in schools to equip young people with the knowledge and skills necessary for meaningful political participation3.

The Potential of Youth in Politics
Despite these challenges, the potential of Filipino youth in shaping the country's political future is immense. Their energy, creativity, and willingness to challenge the status quo can drive significant change. Here are some ways in which the youth can shape Philippine politics:

Advocacy and Activism: Young people have been at the forefront of various advocacy movements, from environmental protection to human rights. Their activism can push for policy changes and hold leaders accountable3.

Innovative Solutions: The youth bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to political and social issues. Their familiarity with technology and digital tools can lead to new approaches in governance and public service2.

Grassroots Mobilization: Young people have the ability to mobilize communities at the grassroots level. By organizing local initiatives and engaging with their peers, they can build a strong base of support for progressive causes1.

Political Candidacy: Encouraging more young people to run for office can diversify the political landscape. Young candidates can bring new ideas and approaches to governance, challenging the dominance of traditional political elites3.

Government and Institutional Support
To harness the potential of the youth, it is essential for the government and institutions to provide support and create an enabling environment for their participation. The National Youth Commission (NYC) plays a crucial role in this regard. Established by the Youth in Nation-Building Act, the NYC coordinates youth-related programs and policies, ensuring that the voices of young Filipinos are heard at the national level3.

Additionally, the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Reform Act of 2015 has introduced key reforms to enhance youth participation in local governance. The SK provides a platform for young leaders to engage in policymaking and community development, fostering a new generation of politically active citizens4.

Conclusion
The youth of the Philippines hold the key to the country's political future. Their demographic power, coupled with their passion and creativity, positions them as a formidable force in shaping the nation's political landscape. By addressing the challenges they face and providing the necessary support, the Philippines can unlock the full potential of its youth, paving the way for a more inclusive, dynamic, and progressive political system.

The future of Philippine politics lies in the hands of its young people. As they continue to engage, advocate, and innovate, they will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on the nation's history, driving it towards a brighter and more equitable future.",1

1,John Nery,"The answers she gave in two Senate hearings were mystifying, and deeply problematic. But then the public discourse swirling about her is equally cringeworthy. The views expressed by the writer are his/her own and do not necessarily reflect the views or positions of Rappler. There IS reason to think that she was a mere stand-in for some principal. She said she didn’t know who some of her fellow incorporators were (even though some of them were also listed as incorporators in other businesses she was a part of); she said she didn’t know how much rental income the Baofu compound in Bamban earned, even though she said that before divesting she owned 50% of the company; she said she couldn’t say exactly how much her businessman-father gave her, or how often, but only that the money came in large amounts – half a million, or a million, or 2 million, at a time. There IS reason for the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC), which led the raid on the Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) located in the compound, to believe that she remains involved in Baofu. Part of the evidence trail leads back to her: A letter of no objection she filed on behalf of Hongsheng Gaming Technology, the original company with a POGO license; utility statements for Hongsheng up until November 2023, six months after its license had been canceled and over a year since Guo became mayor; a vehicle in the compound registered to her; a current Tarlac Electric Cooperative bill in her name and title (“Mayor Alice Guo, Pandan, Bamban”). There IS reason for the Department of the Interior and Local Government to seek her preventive suspension. The mystery of the missing grinders and grinder operators is proof of the kind of costly foot-dragging that a sitting mayor can force an entire bureaucracy to adopt. One Friday after the raid, PAOCC enlisted the cooperation of Bamban-based grinder operators to open all the 27 safes and vaults found in the compound the following Monday. That Monday, none of the equipment could be found, and all the operators, whether working for the municipality or in the private sector, were away on what PAOCC was told was a town-sponsored seminar. PAOCC ended up using acetylene torches. And there IS reason for the public to suspect her citizenship was not genuine. The discrepancies in the wedding dates of her listed parents as recorded in her birth certificate (registered when she was already 19) and in the birth certificates of two of her siblings; her own insistence that her father was a Chinese national but all the children’s birth certificates identified him as Filipino; the negative certification from the Philippine Statistics Authority that there is no record of birth of either Angelito Guo or Amelia Leal and no record of their marriage – these irregularities are concerning. But of equal concern, in my view, is the heat and hate, the virulent vitriol, of public opinion about her. Two aspects of the current public discourse swirling about Mayor Guo should give us pause. Filipino racism. In the May 22 Senate hearing, committee chair Senator Risa Hontiveros was careful to say at the start that the issue of Mayor Guo’s citizenship was directly related to the issue under investigation – if unscrupulous operators were using POGO as legal cover to run criminal syndicates that trafficked in persons and forced them into criminal acts. Whether Guo is a Filipino citizen is germane to her ownership of various companies, and of course to her eligibility as mayor. The controversy caused by her two appearances in the Senate has generated a tsunami of social media memes. In my own view, the funniest, but also the most searing, was the juxtaposing of two captioned images from two Senate hearings: above, Guo shown speaking her most memorable line (“Lumaki po ako sa farm” – literally, I grew up on a farm), and below, Senator Cynthia Villar, wife of the country’s richest man and symbol of a business empire with a reputation for turning agricultural land into commercial property, with the imagined caption “Saang farm ba ‘yan (Where is that farm)? A joke very like a condominium: Many levels! But together with all the funny came all the ugly. Guo has been deservedly criticized for her lapses in memory or general evasiveness, but she has also been hated on, insulted, mocked, reviled, for how she looks, how she sounds, how her tongue moves, how Chinese she must be. That is racism, plain and simple. Old attitudes against the Chinese in the Philippines lurk not too far beneath the surface. Scratch the skin, and the insults, the condescension, the paranoia, come spilling out. The trigger doesn’t have to be a controversial mayor’s obvious nonsense under oath; it can be anything, even superlative and exemplary achievement. I remember the case of Tiffany Grace Uy, who graduated summa cum laude from the University of the Philippines in 2015 with the highest general weighted average since before World War II: a 1.004. That new record was headline news, before it became social media fodder. An idiot posted: “Another Chinese blood…listed in the history of UP, a University suppose [sic] to be for FILIPINO and for POOR.” Another wrote: “Chinese amp (short for the expletive ‘amputa,’ itself short for ‘anak ng puta’ or son of a whore) wala bang pure Pinoy naman (is there no pure Filipino this time)?” A third idiot, feeling the compulsion to say something smart, wrote: “Ask her what she’s gna (gonna) do about China’s territorial grabbing – if she is our president now. She will fail.” In comments like these, we can see the familiar patterns of anti-Chinese racism in the Philippines: They know how to make money, they are not true or pure Filipinos, they are not loyal to the Philippines. To be sure, under Xi Jinping’s leadership, Beijing’s aggressive expansionism in the South China Sea and especially in parts of the West Philippine Sea have deepened concerns among the Philippine public; since at least 2012, a steady pulse of majority support beats for a more assertive Philippine response. The possibility that Mayor Guo is not only complicit but actively taking part in a Beijing-directed conspiracy to infiltrate the Philippine political class has of course not been ruled out; the inquiry is continuing. It adds fuel to the fire. But that fire threatens to singe, or even consume, many innocents: good Filipino citizens of Chinese ancestry, who like many of their forebears have chosen to devote their lives to the country. Political sensationalism. As a direct result of the controversy Guo provoked in the May 7 hearing, the next one, on May 22, not only attracted a larger audience but also drew more senators. In previous hearings, it had only been Hontiveros and an equally hardworking Senator Sherwin Gatchalian directing the inquiry. This time, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada and senators Raffy Tulfo and Loren Legarda joined the fray. In over a quarter-century of journalism, I’ve seen many old truths upended, but the power of the Senate to direct national attention remains largely true. Even in a fragmented media landscape, the Senate retains enough political and media capital to set the public agenda; consider Pharmally, or the pastillas scam. As a counter-example, consider the House of Representatives; only a tiny fistful of House investigations end up shaping public opinion. If the larger political objective is to generate public support and momentum to finally stop the operation of POGOs in the Philippines, then the presence of additional senators can only be an advantage. Someone like Tulfo, who created an alternative information infrastructure based on delivering justice to ordinary citizens and then converted that into a political base, is especially welcome. And yet. The public appeal that returned Estrada to the Senate and placed Tulfo in its inner sanctum is built on a kind of political sensationalism, an appreciation of politics as theater, offering spectacle and, occasionally, even catharsis. I did not expect either Estrada or Tulfo to have undertaken the same preparations for the hearing as Hontiveros and Gatchalian, who have been at the POGO-as-scam-hub issue for much longer. Estrada tried to offer something new, but in a way that was teleserye-like. He said he had received information that a mayor from Pangasinan province was a) Mayor Guo’s lover or partner and b) he was the one actually running the POGO business in Tarlac. Guo denied the double insinuation. Estrada and Guo then engaged in an exchange, lasting several rounds, of sly accusation and repeated denial that the people gathered in the Senate session hall found amusing. Hontiveros had to admonish Guo, reminding her that it was “no laughing matter.” But it was entertainment – precisely of the kind we have come to expect from Estrada, who inherited his father’s gift. Tulfo did not offer any new information; instead, he contributed his theory of human psychology, an essential feature of his shows. At one point, he criticized Guo for failing to respond with what he called “but natural and human reaction.” At another point, refusing to accept that the issue of bloodlines and family relations was, as Guo said, a sensitive issue for her family, he said that Guo should have told off her father: “C’mon, Dad. Give me a break. Tell the truth. I deserve the truth, right?” To this cinematic cliche, Tulfo added a pronouncement. “Oh, you didn’t ask that? I don’t believe you.” Instead of entertainment, Tulfo offered severity of judgment, the kind of tough-talking therapy he uses on his shows. In a particularly revealing and sensational address, delivered in a mix of Filipino and English, he spoke to Guo directly: “Alam naman talaga namin kung sino ka, kaya lang (We already know who you are, but) it’s very hard for us right now to find out, that’s why we’re trying to get more information about who you really are, because we know, and everybody knows…and you know in your heart, na inconsistent ka (that you’re inconsistent) and you’re lying.” We have already judged you, even though we are still gathering the facts: That, plus entertainment value, sums up much of the current public discourse about the issue today. What should we, as a country, do about Mayor Alice Guo? Follow the often-flawed processes of accountability. (The Senate is not a court.) Follow the money. (Estrada made a really sensible suggestion, to invite Guo’s father to the Senate investigation. Perhaps he understands the role of a patriarch in a family with many interests.) Follow the law. The one thing we should stop following are our worst instincts. To tweak the famous quote from the other Pogo (the good one, the comic strip character): “We have met the enemy, and he is also us.”",0
2,John Nery,"Confusing one with the other allows disinformation peddlers like SMNI to claim rights they don’t possess. Here’s an anecdote from the 1990s. A friend’s brother was waiting for a ride outside a convenience store in a gasoline station when a pair of men pulled a knife on him. Suddenly, a female journalist rushed out of the store, brandished her press ID, and ran toward the group, shouting, “Media ‘to! Media ‘to” (I’m media)! The startled men scattered, leaving the brother unharmed. Much about this story seems incredible, even apocryphal. The woman rushing out to break up a crime in progress is only the most outstanding detail. But the fearless or even reckless use of press identification as a kind of shield hits different now, a decade and a half after the Ampatuan massacre and mere years after the Duterte presidency demonized the press wholesale. Recalling the story now, I am struck by how dated – that is to say how characteristic of a particular time – the encounter was. It couldn’t have happened during the martial law era; I doubt if it can happen these days. It strikes me now as a relic from the last 15 years of the 20th century and the first 10 of the 21st, a high point for what we now call legacy media. But in my retelling of this encounter, I used key terms interchangeably. I identified a journalist, I mentioned a press card, I recalled what the friend’s brother heard his rescuer shout about being a member of the media. In ordinary conversation, in polite banter, in informal settings, we interchange “journalism,” “press,” and “media” all the time. By and large, we mean the same thing, though we use different words. We understand; we are understood. But the journalism professor and media critic Jay Rosen, whom I have been following for almost three decades now (first on the internet and then on social media), makes a helpful distinction between the three terms. 
On February 22, 2021, in the depths of the pandemic, Rosen posted a 26-tweet thread that drew important distinctions (and that was itself a demonstration of the importance of making distinctions). One of the tweets read: Media, journalism, and the press are not interchangeable terms. Yet they are bound up with one another. Media is the attention industry Journalism is a social practice The press is a key institution in a democracy Journalists who work in the media carry forward ‘the press’. Rosen had previously made a distinction between audience (“people attending to a common object, typically a performance or spectacle”) and public (“people with different interests who live in the same space and share common problems”). He wrote: “An audience is not a public.” He also wrote: “I think of the media as an attention business, an industry whose product is audiences.” Set of practices. By media, then, he means the system or the business that underlies journalism (as well as other forms of audience-seeking content). By journalism, he means the current set of practices that journalists follow, to do their work. And by the press as institution, he means (and this is my understanding of the idea) a democratic office – that is, a public position of some authority and service. This was not the first time Rosen drew the distinctions. For instance, in a wide-ranging conversation in April 2012 with Ethan Zuckerberg, then with the Center for Civic Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he spoke of this “tripartite” nature in depth. (See Jay Rosen’s Three-Layer Journalism Cake, or watch the forum on the MIT website.) Starting with an ode to the political thinker Hannah Arendt, who was a master at making distinctions, Rosen prefaced his remarks by attempting to “pull apart” the three terms. “The practice of journalism, that’s one thing…the practice is what people do when they’re doing journalism.” “The second thing I want to talk about…is the underlying media system that the practice runs on.” By media, he said, he meant “the way that we produce information, distribute it, connect people to it, in society as a whole. That’s different than the practice of journalism.” Then he said: “The third thing that we should be able to pull apart is the institution of the press…. The press as an institution, first of all, is different from country to country. The reason it’s different from country to country is it’s very powerfully a product of law. If you don’t have laws establishing freedom of the press, you don’t have any press. You might have journalism, you might have a media system, but you don’t have a press because everything that happens is just a pale reflection of power. So until you have a public sphere, until you have a free press, until you have a legal system that secures the right of a free press, you can’t have a press.” Threefold distinctions. I have found these distinctions to be decidedly useful. I had a chance to address a small group of United Nations regional officials in Bangkok in 2023 together with other guests, and I used my time to explain these threefold distinctions, and to argue that they can be used to align or prioritize UN work or assistance in freedom-of-expression and access-to-information issues.
Do reporters or photographers have the right to organize themselves as a labor union? While this question has freedom-of-the-press implications, it is (I submit) eminently a media issue – that is, it relates to the business or system side, as do questions about reasonable wages or working hours. Should all journalists, including editors and producers, follow company policies regulating social media use? While this question has media-as-business implications, it is (I suggest) primarily a journalism issue – that is, it relates to the set of practices that journalists follow as they do their work.
Can a reporter be required by an executive agency to reveal the source of particularly damning allegations? While this question has journalism-as-a-practice implications, it is (I wager) firstly a free press issue. Journalists must be able to guarantee their anonymous sources, especially those fearing retaliation or even violence for the mere act of speaking out, that their identities will be protected. (Unlike, say, in the United States, the Philippines since 1946 has had the benefit of the Sotto Law protecting the duty of journalists to not reveal their sources.) In the case of SMNI, or Sonshine Media Network International, the broadcast network owned by Apollo Quiboloy’s religious group, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ or KOJC, the airing of an erroneous report or commentary about Speaker Martin Romualdez is not and should not be cause enough to suspend its operations temporarily or to revoke its congressional franchise permanently. That is to give too much consideration, and power, to one man. The wisdom of that venerable libel ruling from the Supreme Court, now over a hundred years old, remains true: “Men in public life may suffer under a hostile and an unjust accusation; the wound can be assuaged with the balm of a clear conscience.”
Suspending SMNI for running a false report on Romualdez is abuse of power – but against what? Against SMNI as a media entity, a business organized to meet the communication objectives of KOJC. A one-strike-and-you’re-out policy is prejudicial to the officers and staff of a company that, because of the nature of the business it is in, is vulnerable to mistakes. If this unfair standard protecting prickly politicians were applied to all media companies, none would be left standing. An anchor or commentator making a terrible error on air is a media issue, because the inevitable occasional error is a matter for the company’s Human Resources department. Policies are or should be in place to enjoin officers and staff not to broadcast an unverified story, to correct an erroneous claim, to sanction those who err, to prevent a recurrence. Pattern of lies. But what about repeated errors or, in the case of hosts Lorraine Badoy Partosa and Jefffey Celiz, a long-term pattern of outright lies and dangerous red-tagging? That situation may be covered by an HR policy too, but at its core it is a journalism issue. It is about the standards of care and responsibility that hosts of a news and commentary program should meet in doing their work. In other words, their record shows that Badoy-Partosa and Celiz have been doing the opposite of journalism: malicious propaganda. Under Section 4 of the law renewing the SMNI franchise (through its parent company), the willful and repeated airing of disinformation is an outright violation of SMNI’s contract with the public: “not use its stations or facilities…for the dissemination of deliberately false information or willful misrepresentation, to the detriment of the public interest.” The case filed by the Movement Against Disinformation with the National Telecommunications Commission against SMNI is based precisely on this reading. But isn’t the attempt to recall SMNI’s franchise an attack on the free press? What’s the difference between SMNI and ABS-CBN, whose franchise Congress refused to renew under pressure from Rodrigo Duterte? The difference is the purpose for which the networks are used and, because form follows function, the way the networks are organized. For all its shortcomings, ABS-CBN sought and continues to seek to serve the public (not its audiences alone) by reporting the whole picture. Despite its self-described status as a “nation-builder,” SMNI serves the needs of KOJC and its “Appointed Son of God.” Does this mean that no religious station can qualify as the press? Not at all. As Rosen argued: “Journalists who work in the media carry forward ‘the press.’” It is the work that serves the public (distinct from the audience). What separates SMNI (and also NET25 at particular junctures in history) from other religious stations is that it willingly serves as a platform for propaganda and disinformation. It does not serve as an office, an institution, of democracy.

3,John Nery,"The complicated but lasting legacy of Benedict XVI. Benedict XVI was a pope of paradoxes: the progressive peritus in Vatican II turned conservative gatekeeper of Council teaching, the extraordinarily gifted theologian who limited debate and silenced Catholic academics, above all the guardian of reform whose startling resignation reformed the Roman Catholic Church in the most fundamental way. His death at the age of 95 was truly the end of an era: He is the last of the popes (after John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II) directly involved in the Second Vatican Council, which convened from 1962 to 1965. Pope Francis, who was still a Jesuit scholastic at the time, was ordained a priest only in 1969. It is also possible that, if the pope who succeeds Pope Francis comes from the Global South again, Benedict may be the last European to serve as pope for some time to come. It is almost certain that the age of European dominance in the Church ended with Benedict’s death. Or to be more precise, the dominance of the thinking that understands the Church as a European institution, highlighted by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger’s second reason for choosing Benedict as his papal name—to honor the great St. Benedict, he said, who “evokes the Christian roots of Europe.” But another generation to which Benedict belongs, that of the men and women who were scandalized by the worldwide youth protests of 1968 and channeled their shock and concern into conservative movements in culture and politics and religion, remains influential. Old habits. In the immediate aftermath of his death, heightened emotions and old habits led to some exaggerated claims. Jean-Pierre Denis, publisher of the international editions of the La Croix newspaper, began his thoughtful appreciation of Benedict’s considerable intellectual legacy by describing him as “the last great European intellectual of the 20th century” – a remarkable claim, considering that other influential thinkers who made their mark in the last century, including one with whom Benedict engaged in an important dialogue, Jurgen Habermas, remain very much alive. It is also remarkable that a scholar of the highest quality served as pope; perhaps this is all that Denis meant, that Benedict was a theologian of great influence and consequence, who earned the esteem of other scholars even outside the discipline of theology. Michael Sean Winters, writing insightfully for the National Catholic Reporter, described Benedict’s decision to resign as “a great act of demystification” of the papal office (objectively true) but also as “an implicit, unspoken rebuke” to Pope, now Saint, John Paul II and his decision to remain in office “despite the incapacities of old age” (an interpretation, not a fact, which discounts Benedict’s own well-considered reason). It is possible to learn from the example of others without the learning necessarily being an act of criticism, much less a rebuke. It is true that Benedict did not want to wither in office as John Paul II did. As he himself said, in his Latin message announcing his resignation: “I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to advanced age, are no longer suitable for the proper exercise of the Petrine ministry.” But that was his own charism, or special gift: The humility to step aside. His predecessor’s was altogether different: The gift to suffer in public. As Benedict said in his homily at John Paul II’s funeral mass: “he increasingly entered into the communion of Christ’s sufferings … And in this very communion with the suffering Lord, tirelessly and with renewed intensity, he proclaimed the gospel, the mystery of that love which goes to the end.” Describing the resignation as a rebuke is an old habit of journalism, storifying conflict even when none exists. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, in a piece that characteristically offered an alternative history of the modern Church, rued that Benedict had “conducted a postpapacy of ambiguous gestures in response to a Vatican that had been delivered, by the mysteries of God’s providence, to his longtime foes.” This is an old habit of partisans and ideologues, framing reality as a constant struggle. But Douthat makes it sound as though Benedict’s retirement (at almost 10 years, longer than his papacy) was spent conducting these ambiguous gestures, instead of the almost uninterrupted life of prayer, contemplation – and unequivocal support for Pope Francis – that it mainly was. New media. As a journalist and a Catholic, I have always been fascinated by Benedict’s understanding of the way the media works. I understand that other people helped in the drafting of, say, his messages for World Communications Day, but comparing his messages with those of Pope Francis, to give an example, immediately shows that their thinking, their personalities, are reflected in the words they choose to release under their own name. Many of Benedict’s WCD messages centered on what he called the “digital continent,” the new “agora” created by digital technology. In 2009, he touched on an essential feature of social media networks like Facebook. “The concept of friendship has enjoyed a renewed prominence in the vocabulary of the new digital social networks that have emerged in the last few years … We should be careful … never to trivialize the concept or the experience of friendship.” In 2011, he noted that the new digital technologies “allow people to meet each other beyond the confines of space and of their own culture,” and then asked: “Who is my ‘neighbor’ in this new world?” In 2013, in his last message, he warned us: “Believers are increasingly aware that, unless the Good News is made known also in the digital world, it may be absent in the experience of many people for whom this existential space is important.” These insights deepen my disappointment at his alternative history of Vatican II, because it is confoundingly media-centric. In 2013, addressing Roman clergy, Benedict asserted that “there was the Council of the Fathers – the real Council – but there was also the Council of the media. It was almost a Council apart, and the world perceived the Council through the latter, through the media.” He added: “For the media, the Council was a political struggle, a power struggle between different trends int he Church.” But in fact, the Council was also a power struggle. As insider accounts prove, there was a “fierce battle” (Time’s Robert Blair Kaiser), a duel between the majority of the bishops and the reactionary Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani and his allies (peddling “papalist nonsense,” the peritus Yves Congar wrote in his diary). Sometimes, conflict does exist, and journalists do right to report on it. True legacy. Where does this paradoxical pope’s true legacy lie? While he has been criticized for his own handling of clerical sexual abuse cases when he was Archbishop of Munich, and continues to be criticized for his predecessor’s inaction, he acted decisively when he was head of the Congregation for Doctrine of the Faith. Thomas Reese, the Jesuit editor who was forced to resign from America magazine because of Benedict, wrote: “When his congregation was assigned abuse cases, the disciplinarian tendencies that led him to police theologians allowed him to cut through canonical niceties to expel hundreds, perhaps thousands, of abusers from the priesthood. His response was never perfect, but he did understand and deal with the problem quicker than any other Vatican official, including John Paul.” When he was pope, he removed an abusive religious founder from the ministry, and met with victims of abuse. His writings will continue to inspire many. His Introduction to Christianity, first published in 1968, remains a model of clarity; his many books, his three encyclicals, his Jesus trilogy (written when he was already pope), will continue to draw new readers (and old ones ready for rereading). He had the teacher’s gift for explaining even the most complicated of subjects. It should come as no surprise that he was the man in charge of John Paul’s project to publish the Catechism of the Catholic Church. “The fact that after an era of very strong theological and ecclesial debates and tensions, within a few years, that is, already by 1992, the work came to fruition in a largely convincing way has something miraculous about it,” wrote his former spokesman, Federico Lombardi SJ. Finally, his assertion of what he called the “hermeneutic of continuity and reform” will for a long time be heard differently, by those who prefer continuity and by those who seek reform of and in the Church, but his decision to resign the papacy, the first such instance in 600 years, could only have been possible because he followed that hermeneutic to the very end. He believed in both; he could resign because the Church allows reform, and he could resign in full confidence because the Church guarantees continuity. Truly a pope of paradoxes.",0
4,John Nery,"Now that she has passed the point of no return, which options will the Vice President choose? The one from 2001, or the one from 1957? The future of the Duterte political brand rests on the 2028 vote, and the run-up to it. Davao City itself remains the family stronghold. The former president’s second son Baste Duterte easily won election as mayor in 2022, his vote total more than eight times that of his closest challenger. Rep. Pulong Duterte, who cruised to victory with 15 times more votes than the next candidate, is poised to win a third term in 2025. And Vice President Sara Duterte herself won the vice-presidential contest in the city with 10% more votes than the mayor-elect; her vote total was 55 times that of the vice presidential candidate with the second highest number of votes. (Interestingly, the “people’s justice” constituency of Sen. Raffy Tulfo in Davao City was not enough to place him in the first 12 Senate slots; he came in 13th.) So mark the city safe for the Dutertes. But the rest of the country? Much will depend on what happens in the next few years: if the doomsday cult leader Apollo Quiboloy is extradited to the United States, if the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant against former president Rodrigo Duterte, if an armed encounter in the West Philippine Sea hardens Philippine public opinion against China, if the scandals involving Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators and scammy Pharmally come home to roost in Davao. It is in the best interest of the Duterte family and their allies, then, to ensure that VP Sara becomes the next president. That is how I understand her resignation from the Cabinet, and from the influential position of education secretary. (The Department of Education is the country’s largest bureaucracy.) She means to do all she can to prepare herself to succeed Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Four types of succession. But consider the vice presidents who succeeded to the presidency. History tells us there are at least four types of succession. The first path is the one contemplated by our constitutions: The president dies in office. Three found themselves traveling down this path: Sergio Osmeña succeeded Manuel Quezon in 1944, Elpidio Quirino succeeded Manuel Roxas in 1948, Carlos Garcia succeeded Ramon Magsaysay in 1957. The second trail is that blazed by Diosdado Macapagal, the first vice president elected from another party that was different from the president’s. Several months after the plane crash that claimed Magsaysay’s life, Garcia of the Nationalistas was elected president in his own right, in November 1957; for the first time, however, a president’s election mandate fell below a majority. Macapagal, because he was a Liberal, was shut out of the Cabinet. He spent the next four years essentially campaigning throughout the country, and handily beat Garcia for the presidency in 1961. The third path is the one that Joseph Estrada defined. While he belonged to a party different from that of Fidel Ramos, he accepted Ramos’ offer to include him in government through a presidential task force tailored to Estrada’s public persona as a tough-talking crimebuster. While he was not politically aligned with Ramos, he remained a popular part of the president’s official family until the end of their term. The fourth is that which unmade Estrada, and made Gloria Arroyo. A People-Powered uprising and the withdrawal of support from the military leadership forced Estrada out of office and installed Arroyo as president in 2001. Which path will VP Sara choose? Based on a reading of the many comments from Duterte supporters on social media, it seems that a good number would favor what I would call the Arroyo option. I do not mean to suggest that Gloria Arroyo, then the vice president, worked actively behind the scenes in early 2001 to undermine President Estrada; I only mean to say that the idea, held by quite a number of supporters of both the former president and his daughter, that Marcos Jr. can be forced to resign and that Sara Duterte can then replace him, is not fiction but rather fantasy fed on the events of 2001. That’s the underlying scenario behind former speaker Pantaleon Alvarez’s seditious appeal to the military to withdraw its support from President Marcos Jr. It’s a scenario nourished on regret and resentment, based on the (correct) assumption that he would not have been elected if he had not teamed up with Duterte. You can sense this skewed theme of false nostalgia run through the comments like an electric current: “She should have been president all along.” But can the Vice President and her allies engineer the ouster of another Marcos? This seems unlikely, if only because the Vice President’s father showed exactly how powerful the presidency is, despite the additional safeguards built into the 1987 Constitution. If he can brazen it out (the Rodrigo Duterte legacy), a president can outlast any rival. In other words, the moral standards or the public virtues we naturally expect of any president are not hard-wired into the system; a president acting exactly like Rodrigo Duterte can throw all that aside, and he will get away with it. Force the Supreme Court to impeach a chief justice without the benefit of impeachment, detain an incumbent senator for almost her entire term on trumped-up charges, impose martial law in Mindanao without meeting constitutional requirements, threaten opponents with mythical narco-lists and lethal red tags, demonize journalists, and so on, ad nauseam. Does Marcos Jr. have the appetite for such a political war of attrition? That remains to be seen, but it is important to remember the lesson we learned from Duterte: The presidency has the capacity to wage that kind of war. Going Macapagal. A more realistic reading of the situation suggests that VP Sara will likely follow the example of Cong Dadong, the “poor boy from Lubao,” who is not coincidentally the father of her close political ally, former president and former speaker Gloria Arroyo. Sara resigned to campaign full time for the presidency. She is now unburdened of the responsibilities of education secretary, for which she was never really qualified in the first place. The same day she resigned, the other main news story about Philippine education was yet more confirmation of its dismal state: In the 2022 cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA, the Philippines ranked in the bottom four in the world in “creative thinking.” This is the sort of news that will haunt any education secretary thinking of a presidential run; by the time VP Sara runs for the presidency in 2028, she would have distanced herself enough from such depressing statistics. (And if the work of the Second Congressional Commission on Education actually bears fruit by then, she can point to her participation, non-consequential but real, in the commission’s initial stages.) She is now free from the need to defend any policy of the Marcos Jr. administration, or at least to keep silent, and free to criticize it on the issues that matter most to the Dutertes and their allies: engagement with the ICC, defense of the West Philippine Sea, peace talks with the communist insurgency. She is now at liberty to test the one message of her father’s that never resonated with the public, the one theme he couldn’t sell: that our future lies in a closer alliance with Beijing. Coming out this early, and this unequivocally, carries a serious risk. If a somewhat cloying reticence propelled her to the top of the pre-election surveys before allying with Marcos Jr., how will undisguised ambition affect her standings? That calls for all kinds of creative thinking.",0
5,John Nery,"The communist insurgency is at its weakest. Counter-intuitively, now is the best time for both sides to resume peace talks and reach a peace deal. A new report by the International Crisis Group published in April concludes that the “Maoist insurgency in the Philippines is at its lowest ebb in decades.” From a high of 25,000 armed regulars in the last years of the Marcos regime, the number of rebels is down to somewhere between 1,200 and 2000 – roughly speaking, close to the same number when the first President Marcos used the then-new insurgency as a pretext for imposing martial rule in 1972. The insurgency is hampered by serious organizational challenges, including “perhaps the most severe leadership crisis in its history” (provoked not only by the death of its founder but also by “the killing [by the Philippine military] of several high-ranking commanders over the last three years”); a reduction in revenues generated from so-called revolutionary taxation (because of the loss of territory and “the arrest of financial operatives”); and internal confusion (“differences among cadres regarding the movement’s political and military direction”). These and other crises can be seen reflected, even without the benefit of context, in the message the Communist Party of the Philippines published to mark its 55th anniversary. Without reference to the combination of military pressure and development outreach that the government has been leveling against the insurgency, the message may read as yet another (though still remarkably candid) exercise in the revolutionary discipline of “criticism and self-criticism.” But read in the context of the rebellion’s continuing loss of leaders, fighters, base areas, resources, and informal support structures, these passages from the December 26, 2023, message confirm that the movement is, in fact, in bad shape. The message recognized that “not a few guerrilla fronts of the [New Peoples Army] stagnated and got stuck for a long time at the old level.” The cause, however, was identified as “some Party leaders,” who “self-constricted the NPA to its reliable guerrilla base areas and mountain encampments, limiting the scope or range of military and political initiative of the Party and NPA. Self-constriction goes against the need for guerrilla units to constantly move forward and advance, and to be always on offensive footing. Reliable guerrilla base areas were eventually reduced to a few ‘favorite’ or ‘comfort zone’ barrios, communities or mountain encampments with easy access to mass support, supply lines or communication facilities.” Military conservatism. The message developed its argument with even more candor: “Self-constriction and loss of initiative leads to military conservatism, as points from which the NPA can hit the enemy became limited or inaccessible. Other concomitant problems that arise include gathering intelligence, sources of supply, communications, and so on. The NPA could not readily carry out an ambush at the highway because its main forces are encamped in the interior areas. Mounting raids, ambushes, and other basic tactical offensives became increasingly cumbersome and time-consuming. They became content with attrition tactical offensives (harassment, sanctions and so on) and lost sight of the need to mount sustained annihilation or basic tactical offensives as the principal component of our strategy to weaken the enemy part by part and steadily strengthen the people’s army. “In a significant number of guerrilla fronts which had company-sized or multiple-platoon-sized forces, some Party leaders became complacent and self-assured. There were cases of over concentration of forces in some regions or sub-regions, where two or more guerrilla companies are brought together in a mountain encampment over extended periods of several months, to conduct trainings, education courses, prolonged meetings or to await execution of an ill-planned offensive, leaving less [sic] forces and less time for mass work. These prolonged encampments caused a heavy strain on the organized masses and militia forces who have to work hard to keep the supply lines running. These also cause guerrilla discipline to slacken and ‘civilianize’ guerrilla forces. Some NPA units have encountered problems of drinking among guerrilla fighters.” And so on, in this vein. The Crisis Group report characterized the CPP as “mindful of these challenges,” and summarized the message of December 2023 (and that of March 2024 too) as a call to “galvanize the movement” and “reinvigorate political and logical education for cadres and combatants.” Peace talks. Does it make strategic sense for the Philippine government to restart peace talks with the CPP-NPA and its National Democratic Front? The joint announcement last November of an agreement to resume peace negotiations was a real surprise – and was met with a mix of skepticism and hope. The skeptical response raised suspicions about political maneuvering ahead of the 2025 midterm elections; when Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ran again for the Senate in 2010, he was on the same slate as Bayan Muna’s Satur Ocampo and Gabriela’s Liza Masa. The hopeful stance recognized that one of the administration’s signatories of the Joint Statement for Peace was Special Adviser to the President Anton Lagdameo, President Marcos’ closest friend. But if the insurgency is at its weakest, why even attempt to strike a peace deal? Shouldn’t the government continue its current campaign mixing military pressure and development outreach until the last base area is recovered, the last guerrilla front overrun? It has already been about a decade since the national security establishment under the second Aquino administration came to the conclusion that the communist insurgency was no longer the country’s main national-security threat. The pivot to external defense or territorial defense operations (TDO) under the second Marcos administration formalizes the downgrading of the insurgency. Peace negotiations will help ease the pivot to external defense. That is the first reason why the Marcos administration should return to the negotiating table. The second reason is the law of diminishing returns; the counter-insurgency campaign that has helped reduce the size of the NPA by about half, since Rodrigo Duterte came to power, may have already reached its optimal phase. Besides, the kind of justification often offered by those who would like the current campaign to continue is very much along the lines of “crushing” the rebellion. The rebels are on the run, why stop hot pursuit? Because history’s lesson is clear. According to “Paths to Victory,” the 2013 RAND Corporation study of 71 insurgencies (updated from its influential 2010 study of 30 insurgencies, titled “Victory Has a Thousand Fathers”), the so-called “iron fist” path succeeds “only 32 percent of the time,” while its opposite approach, the so-called motive-focused path, succeeds 73 percent of the time. The iron fist approach to counterinsurgency (COIN) focuses primarily on “eliminating the insurgent threat,” while the motive path addresses “the motives for beginning and sustaining the insurgency.” In other words, the iron fist seeks to hammer the insurgents to oblivion, while the motive-focused approach resolves the conditions that gave rise to and supplies the insurgency. And the lesson from the history of insurgency from 1944 to 2010 is that the COIN odds do not favor the use of force alone. To quote the 2013 study: “The importance of reducing insurgents’ tangible support is the center-most finding of this research. Successful COIN forces reduce not only the active insurgents but also the support that fuels the insurgency.” But the Philippine Army, by far the largest of the services, has more invested in continuing the counterinsurgency campaign than any other institution; it is, hyperbolically, the only thing they know. They (and the Duterte political alliance) may stand in the way. Weaker position. Does it make strategic sense for the communist insurgency to enter into peace talks? As the scattered leadership must be only too aware, they will be returning to the negotiating table with a much weaker position. But they do own a conspicuous advantage: They offer the second President Marcos the historic opportunity of ending the insurgency that started under the first President Marcos. If the Marcos family were serious about rehabilitating their family name, concluding real peace with the communist rebels would rank high among the pathways to rehabilitation – not as high as paying their billion-peso tax arrears or returning their ill-gotten wealth, but high enough to cement their new reputation in Western capitals. But peace talks may also result in the suspension of red-tagging and red-baiting by government and military officials (the provocative actions of Duterte supporters is a different problem altogether), and may create the momentum necessary to review and improve the work of the task force overseeing the government’s COIN campaign. Not the abolition that UN Special Rapporteur Irene Kahn had strongly recommended (that looks outside the realm of political probability), but at least a change that renders it more community-oriented, more representative, more civilian. (The Crisis Group makes the same recommendations.) Time to talk peace again.",0
6,Iris Gonzales,"This time of the year between Christmas and New Year is a Dead Week of sorts, when homes are a bit quiet compared to the frantic schedule the whole year round; cities are less crowded and some families are out on vacation.

Society is on a pause of sorts and people don’t really want to do much or accomplish anything, resigned to the fact that what’s done is done.

It’s also a good time to take stock of the year that would soon be over.

Now how can we talk about 2023 without discussing politics and how it took centerstage for the most part of the year?

While both camps are denying it to the high heavens, it’s obvious that the much touted UniTeam Alliance, the electoral alliance between the Marcos and Duterte camps, is now a thing of the past.

And we’re of course treated to a ringside view of the conflict, as gripping and as tense as a Manny Pacquiao boxing fight.

I say treated because, admit or not, here in our Republic of Marites, we love being spectators in our dirty political arena. If, as Marx said, religion is the opium of the masses, politics, no doubt, is the opiate of the rest of the population.

And as I said, what a gripping boxing match it has been or still is.

There’s the House of Representatives’ successful move to strip Vice President Sara Duterte’s offices of confidential funds.

Rody Duterte came to the rescue of his daughter Sara, saying with all certainty that the realignment was politically motivated and related to the 2028 presidential polls where President Marcos’ cousin and House Speaker Martin Romualdez and the Vice President are perceived as frontrunners.

And then there’s Sara Duterte recently criticizing President Marcos for reopening peace talks with communist rebels in what marks as her first major public rebuttal of the President and his administration’s policies.

And then there’s the move of the House against Sonshine Media Network International whose program hosts have used their platform to red-tag activists and some media organizations. I don’t agree with the revocation of the franchise but I agree that the network should be investigated for all the fake news and red-tagging it has unleashed. Changes must be implemented.

Silver lining
There is a silver lining in all these moves. At last, past actions of the Duterte administration are now being rectified.

Clearly, the Dutertes’ unparalleled arrogance was no match for the stars that aligned at the House. Suddenly progressive lawmakers and the powers-that-be have become strange bedfellows. Ah, welcome to our land of the bizarre.

Bad news is that this is happening largely because of politics and as I said earlier, policy changes that are motivated by politics may not really be sustainable.

It would have been better if accountability and justice were the primary motivations to correct misdeeds of past administrations.

My fearless forecast is this politicking will continue throughout the new year.

Social concerns
We can only hope our policymakers and lawmakers won’t be so distracted that they forget there are a lot of pressing social concerns – from the worsening crisis in education to low economic productivity to food security, not to mention a possible resurgence of COVID-19.

As the recent GlobalSource report by former central bank deputy governor Diwa Guinigundo and Wilhelmina Mañalac noted, the latest Business Expectations Survey showed that Philippine businesses remained modestly positive in their outlook for the current quarter compared to the previous quarter as measured through the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Confidence Index. The index was up by only 0.1 percentage point in Q4 2023 (35.9) compared to Q3 (35.8).

There is tempered optimism, no thanks to the negative effect of the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, inflation and higher interest rates.

Thus, next year could be an even more difficult year if the downside risks to the economy such as higher inflation and lack of jobs materialize.

GlobalSource has likewise warned: “We doubt whether the government has a solution to the prolonged El Niño dry spell next year using better rice production technology.”

“This is one of the tasks cut out for the new economic czar Frederick Go – to orchestrate the deployment of public policy to mitigate pressing social concerns, not the least of which is attaining food security within the context of sustained economic growth,” it also said.

There is so much to do indeed and I hope our uncanny politics does not get in the way.

There’s only the whole of 2024 to get as many critical reforms as possible done because by 2025, our politicos will be busy preparing for the midterm elections.

What I fervently hope to see are more actions, not early campaign photo-ops; more reforms and less politicking; more policy changes for the better and less graft and corruption; more jobs for Filipinos, not just investment pledges.

As it is now, this country’s institutions have been bastardized and co-opted by selfish and self-serving politicians and corrupted to the core.

But all is not lost.

Hope springs eternal, as I always say. This is etched in my heart like a tattoo because I believe in it as much as I believe in our country and our people’s full potential.

But we all need to believe in it and demand for the changes that we deserve so that someday soon, our beloved home country will finally be the great nation that it should be.",0
7,Iris Gonzales,"In today’s newsrooms, says tycoon Manuel V. “MVP” Pangilinan, the title of “editor” is perhaps the most inaccurate.

Why so? MVP argues:

Publishers publish, reporters report and journalists work on journals. One would think that all editors do is edit.

“But your jobs – as you know – are far more important, and much more intensive than marking up your writers’ drafts. You have perhaps the most crucial job of all – which is choosing what to focus on, and deciding what the news is,” he says.

Brave new world
This is particularly important, MVP says, as he recognized the existence of artificial intelligence and its curatorial influence on information via algorithms.

But this doesn’t mean the job of the editor has become obsolete, he says.

“In fact, you are all more valuable than ever before. In cyberspace where answers are available everywhere, you determine which questions are worth asking,” says the tycoon during a recent gathering of news editors organized by the MVP Group.

Perhaps MVP, the chairman and CEO of the many companies he leads, is also well aware that consumption has changed drastically.

The same is true in the news. The way people consume news today and the way news affects the world, have significantly changed.

As MVP says, it’s a time when what confronts us is something in the mold of English author Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel, Brave New World where, the tycoon notes, “people are flooded with so much information that it’s impossible to distinguish what’s important from what’s not.”

The greatest weapons against such a threat are news editors, MVP says.

It’s one of those times when MVP, whose sprawling business empire includes stakes – big or small – in media organizations, puts the spotlight on the people who sift through the dizzying avalanche of stories every single day and decide which ones would have the biggest impact on the lives of Filipinos.

KathNiel
Times indeed are changing. Who would have thought for instance that KathNiel fans would have a collective breakdown after Filipino celebrity couple Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla announced their split after 11 years of being young lovers on-screen and off-screen?

At least one local newspaper put it on the front page, perhaps to acknowledge this heartbreak of millions of Filipinos. Television news programs interrupted their regular hard news to announce the break-up. The Singapore Straits Times carried a story about it.

Were newspapers correct in giving so much prominence to the KathNiel breakup?

At best, it was a recognition that a great big part of the Filipino population were in tears.

Perhaps, sometimes, sifting through news isn’t always about looking for stories that would make people less hungry or more hungry. It’s also about recognizing stories that affect – momentarily or otherwise – the Filipino people’s soul, something AI can’t figure out just yet.

Perhaps, it’s no coincidence that MVP reminded us about Huxley’s Brave New World, which warned against a society devoid of deep connections that make us truly human and alive.

More imported meat from Brazil
Speaking of hard news and gut issues, some recent news from Brazil caught my attention.

Brazil, the world’s top chicken exporter and home to giant meatpackers, announced in early November that it was extending an avian flu-related national health emergency for another 180 days due to more detections of the virus.

The South American country has confirmed avian flu cases in wild birds as early as May 2023 and declared a health emergency a week later.

Just last Nov. 7, Brazil announced that it was extending the national health emergency, Reuters has reported.

Japan had imposed a temporary ban on Brazilian chicken products coming from Espirito Santo state in late June and from Santa Catarina, Brazil’s second largest producer and exporter of chicken, in mid-July.

Although Brazil said the highly infectious virus has not yet reached commercial flocks, it has 139 confirmed outbreaks of the disease, including in wild birds, subsistence poultry and mammals, the Reuters report also said.

Against this backdrop, I’m curious why the Philippines wants to pave the way for more meat imports from Brazil.

The South American country is seeking system-wide accreditation that will allow its establishments to export animals, meat and meat products to the Philippines.

Thus, in a special order last month, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said he is sending an inspection mission to Brazil for the accreditation of Brazilian foreign meat establishments.

Normally, this is just a standard procedure. When countries want to export meat and meat products to the Philippines, they need to apply for systemwide accreditation which would entail actual inspection of their animal health and safety standards.

But there are many factors at play here. Why do we want to bring in more meat imports at this time and from a country with confirmed cases of avian flu?

Brazil’s meat products such as beef, pork or chicken parts could directly compete with Filipino farmers who are already struggling.

As it is now, mechanically deboned meat or those used to make products such as sausage, nuggets, luncheon meat, etc. already enjoy a two-year, five percent tariff rate which exporters are currently enjoying. The Marcos administration has extended the lower tariffs to end-2024.

Imports help ensure the continued supply of food products in the country at affordable prices but as I’ve said before, we must also make sure that our local industries get enough support.",0
8,Iris Gonzales,"After more than a year and after several other names cropped up in the business grapevine, at last we finally have an agriculture secretary.

Newly appointed Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. will be racing against time because of the enormity of the work that needs to be done – from ensuring food security to addressing specific problems of our local industries.

This early, there are already some hiccups – expected of course – including the fact that he did not graduate from the University of Santo Tomas despite official documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying so. (Congratulations to campus journalists from The Varsitarian for putting the spotlight on this).

Hiccups aside, I hope he will be able to improve a sector that was once upon a time, our country’s pride, hope and source of economic growth.

It’s a challenging task for sure and one must be a bit crazy to accept the agriculture post especially in these hard times. But then again, sometimes the crazy are the ones who get things done. We’ll see about that.

My hope is that he would be open to huge changes in the present structure of the Department of Agriculture and work closely with people on the ground – the farmers, the fisherfolk, the local government units.

As I said before, the present structure of the agriculture department is from the top down wherein plans and programs emanate from the top with hardly any consultation from those on the ground and implemented in a one-size-fits all manner. This isn’t always effective because different regions have different problems.

Sec. Laurel can change this by working closely with the different LGUs because they are the ones who are in touch with the farmers. The farmers know and listen to the LGUs’ provincial agriculture and municipal officers, as former agriculture undersecretary Dr. Cristino “Resty” Collado pointed out.

This could help a lot in determining how to allocate food production budget, say the rice production budget, for example. Those in the top 10 rice producing regions should be prioritized while top performers can be rewarded with a higher budget from the DA.

Rice
In the food hierarchy, three major commodities must be tackled properly – rice, meat and sugar, as I said before.

Rice is top in the hierarchy, the mainstay in every Filipino meal.

Sec. Laurel would have to create an effective partnership with farmers to boost rice productivity. This, in turn, can be done with the DA and the different LGUs working together.

For example, the local chieftains can distribute seeds and fertilizer directly to the target. They can identify which areas need to be prioritized the most.

Pork, chicken

Next in the food hierarchy is pork. Whether we like it or not, healthy or otherwise, we are such a meat eating country.

Welcome to this lechon republic!

Indeed, meat products, mainly pork and chicken, are the usual food items that most Filipinos complement with rice.

Also, the price of pork is the lead barometer used to plan for family food budgets. Prices of poultry and fish follow when prices of pork go up.

Speaking of meat, we are also having problems with cheap imports.

Industry sources have said that a lot of meat products have been kept in cold storage facilities for months on end.

Normally, this is allowed but in recent months, there have been numerous reports of some of these meat products stored far too long and no longer fit for consumption yet are finding their way into stores and wet markets in the country without any information on their expiry or production dates.

The least the government can do is to make sure that every product sold to consumers is properly labeled.

Raids by the DA months ago and industry monitoring from local producers have shown that tubs and tubs of unbranded and spoiled chicken products are sold in some wet markets such as those in Bulacan and Caloocan.

There are even reports that a cold storage operator in northern Luzon buys imported meat products – some of which may be expired – and sells these goods to food kiosks selling chickens, dumplings, etc. This is a horror story, if true.

The DA must be vigilant and must look into these reports that’s been going around the industry.

Data from the Bureau of Animal Industry showed that the country bought 289.52 million kilograms of chicken overseas in the first eight months of the year, 35.4 percent higher compared to the 244.8 million a year ago.

Not surprisingly, our local meat producers are hurting.

Sugar
And then there’s the bitter situation surrounding our sugar industry, which is now on the brink of extinction due to neglect and our obsession with imports.

Importing goods of course is always the more convenient route because these goods are cheaper.

But there’s always the issue of smuggling and poor quality of imported food, especially meat products.

The different problems surrounding our top commodities point to a common solution and that is to increase local production. This is of course easier said than done and may not be the fastest solution.

But for the sake of our farmers, producers and for our own food security, we must do it.

How we get there under Sec. Laurel’s leadership remains to be seen. Would he be able to strike that delicate balance between ensuring affordable food prices and strengthening local production?

I hope we find out soon enough.",0
9,Iris Gonzales,"The P48-billion budget overrun reported by telco giant PLDT marks another chapter in its long, colorful and winding history – 94 years and counting.

It’s a major development for the country’s oldest and largest telecommunications giant and even PLDT chairman Manuel V. “MVP” Pangilinan’s arowana knows it.

MVP shared on Twitterverse on Monday that his arowana died, a death which feng shui believers consider a “noble sacrifice.”

Indeed, many believe that when an arowana dies, it is often a noble sacrifice that takes away the bad luck or misfortune that has befallen a household or perhaps a business.

“Probably absorbed all the angst of PLDT on our behalf,” MVP said.

Often called the “dragon fish” because its metallic coin-like scales undulate like the paper dragons we see during Chinese New Year, the arowana has spawned the belief that the fish brings good luck and prosperity. It’s no surprise it’s a favorite among Asian elite.

True or not, one thing is clear. Investors are waiting with bated breath for the result of PLDT’s internal investigation on the budget overrun.

Impairment
As I write this, PLDT is set to talk to investors and analysts. Reporters covering the beat are staking out. By the time this column comes out, PLDT may have already clarified the issues. It said last week that it has not uncovered fraudulent transactions or procurement anomalies.

Even MVP’s business rival Ramon “RSA” Ang, who knows the nature of a telco business, believes it was unlikely that the overrun was due to fraud.

It was not ‘mathematically possible’ to defraud a company of P48 billion, Ang said.

Instead, it may have been more of an impairment issue arising from some – and expensive – telco network equipment that may have been acquired but was not used as intended or did not deliver on its intended use. This might have been largely due to tech factors such as becoming obsolete or being no longer applicable in certain areas by the time the different types of equipment were delivered.

RSA noted that in the telco business, this can happen because there are many moving parts and technology changes in the wink of an eye. Thus, what may be applicable or needed today may no longer be useful tomorrow.

Another source said the P48 billion refers to equipment already in use that was not yet officially accepted. Thus it is not yet recorded in the books of PLDT. This means they aren’t depreciated yet in accounting terms.

The source said that “if you use the average life of ten years,” depreciation would have reduced the operating income by P4.8 billion a year and about P3.6 billion after tax.

Ambulance chasers
Ambulance chasers have already smelled blood. News from the US showed that US law firms are urging affected investors to file a complaint against the telco giant.

We will now have to wait and see what happens next, including the results of the inquiry of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Everyone is waiting with bated breath.

What is clear for now is that this development will certainly mark a major chapter in PLDT’s long, corporate history.

Philippine Airlines sees milestone profit year

Over at another company, Philippine Airlines, the country’s flag carrier, is reaping the benefits of the travel industry’s recovery.

PAL expects to record a milestone profit year for 2022, thanks to revenge travel.

In a recent chat, PAL president and COO Capt. Stanley Ng  said almost all routes are back to pre-pandemic levels except China, which only just started to ease COVID-19 related curbs.

For the third quarter of the year, PAL registered an operating income of P4.9 billion and comprehensive income of P4.2 billion.

This brought nine-month income to P11.5 billion and the comprehensive income to P8.3 billion, signifying the continuing resurgence of the Philippines’ only full-service network airline amid the ongoing recovery of air travel and tourism.

But Capt. Stanley said there’s still a lot of work to be done to sustain growth.

These include further improving PAL’s customer service, adding more flights and opening new routes.

PAL just opened a new route between Cebu and Baguio City last Dec. 16, marking PAL’s comeback to Baguio, the very first destination it served nearly 82 years ago.

“So we are happy to be flying back to where it all started,” Capt. Stanley said.

PAL to Europe
PAL may also return to Europe by 2025, “an aspirational target,” he said during our chat, just days after he arrived from Brussels where he joined President Marcos in a meeting with Brussels Airport CEO Arnaud Feist.

This happened at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-European Union (ASEAN-EU) Commemorative Summit last week.

Last mile
PAL wingwoman Cielo Villaluna also shared with me that PAL will soon have a last mile shipping service, which will be a game changer for the cargo industry and would be beneficial to Filipinos, especially in this age of speedy deliveries.

Things indeed are looking up for PAL but as Capt. Stanley said, the flag carrier still has a lot of room for improvement.

I’ve been on a few PAL flights recently and I have no issues. I even raved about the excellent in-flight food from Manila to New York but I continue to hear a lot of horror stories from other passengers – from lost baggage to delayed flights to the long wait for their bags at the conveyor belt.

May all these problems be resolved sooner than later so that Filipinos and visitors alike can truly enjoy traveling, whether for business or pleasure.",0
10,Iris Gonzales,"The sun is out, the storm has passed. The Paeng-induced bedlam has died down at least for now. It’s business as usual again at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), the country’s main gateway.

The past few days, however, a different kind of mayhem descended into the airport; of how a new general manager has been appointed, surprising NAIA insiders and the whole industry.

But as I write this piece on this sunny Monday morning, I’m told that it’s still business as usual at the airport after all, despite news of a new Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) general manager.

Transportation Secretary Jaime “JJB” Bautista also confirmed to me that it’s another day at work for MIAA general manager Cesar Chiong.

“It’s business as usual,” Sec. JJB said.

This is good news, some airport insiders said. Many of them are happy with GM Chiong’s leadership style.

“He is doing very well. Everyone is inspired to work. His style of management is that of the private sector,” one insider shared with me.

By private sector-like leadership style, they meant that GM Chiong is professional, listens to everyone and makes a decision based on what is best for all.

Sec. JJB said the same thing. Even members of the board of directors of MIAA have been actively participating in meetings now, just like in the boardrooms of private corporations, he said.

GM Chiong is a veteran aviation executive with at least 30 years experience with Philippine Airlines, Air Philippines and in San Miguel Corp. prior to joining the government, said Sec. JJB, who handpicked him for MIAA.

Reforms
He has been instituting reforms and has been going after those with unpaid financial obligations to the airport, insiders said. The money was meant to finance improvements such as in the different terminals and in digitizing airport processes.

These efforts may have ruffled some feathers who might have lobbied for leadership changes in MIAA, sources said.

Snake pit
This shouldn’t be the case, really. Serving in government shouldn’t feel like being in a snake pit and that you could lose your job any moment.

Unfortunately, it seems the most uncertain job positions these days – as uncertain as in Elon Musk’s Twitter – are in government.

How many ranking Palace officials have had to leave for unclear reasons the past months? Is this a reflection of the supposed power play among the different groups in this administration?

I heard there are eight power blocks surrounding the President. If true, they put the PNoy-era Samar and Balay rivalry to shame.

Gods of NAIA
On a serious note, I hope to see the continuation of reforms in our airports, especially in NAIA, the country’s most important gateway. If GM Chiong is seriously fixing the problems including weeding out money-making syndicates, then let this continue.

There are a lot of changes that need to be implemented to improve airport operations. Otherwise, we will continue to experience mayhem whenever there are calamities or extraordinary situations such as holidays, which are peak seasons for traveling.

GM Chiong has a lot more to do to improve airport operations. I wrote about the Paeng-related mess two weeks ago. Six years won’t be enough to implement lasting changes in the airport but if we keep changing the leadership in the middle of reforms, we would just be going around in circles.

Many of our longtime airport officials and rank-and-file workers are smart, hardworking and sincere civil servants. They deserve a competent leader.

Controversial positions such as airport GMs should never be politicized. In fact, anyone trying to reform our gateways – or any government agency for that matter – by weeding out money-making syndicates or the so-called Gods of NAIA should have the full backing of the President.

These syndicates have been getting their way for decades now. Isn’t this the reason why past private sector attempts to take over the operations and management of NAIA – even with the combined strength of seven of the country’s biggest conglomerates – never prospered?

At the end of the day, without improvements in our airports, it is the traveling public who will continue to suffer. More often than not, when we fly in and fly out, we experience chaos in our airports.

While fixing NAIA, we should also have a new and alternative gateway.

Bulacan Airport
Sec. JJB shared with me that during the weekend, he and his team also inspected the progress of the New Manila International Airport or the Bulacan International Airport of San Miguel Corp.

There’s been significant progress, says Sec. JJB, referring to the massive dredging works on the site of the airport and he is excited. I hope that indeed we will finally see a new and alternative gateway in the years to come. We needed a new airport yesterday.

Home
I dream to see the day when we can all pass through a gateway that is among the best in the world, one that is consistently efficient and excellent; one that is comfortable and convenient for each and every passenger and not just for Business Class or VIP travelers; one that will give us an enjoyable experience between flights; one that isn’t just business as usual but so much better.

The airport is that last thing we see when we depart and the first thing that welcomes us when we come home.

Rappler CEO Maria Ressa addressed the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health’s Class of 2019 on Sunday, August 11, urging them to build their identity, profession, and the nation’s democracy by embracing their values, their fears, and their journey. 

A total of 148 graduates received their dual MD/Master of Business Administration degrees. 

“You will help define what our society will look like and how our democracy will survive and evolve,” she told the graduates at the Meralco Theater. “This is a time of creative destruction. Even as we see what’s being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now,” she said.

Below is the full text of her speech.

Congratulations, Class of 2019!

You’re graduating at an existential moment in history. 

When global power structures are turned upside down by technology, triggering an erosion of all our rights.

When journalists around the world are under attack, democracy is under attack. 

I know this firsthand: in 14 months, the Philippine government filed at least 11 cases and investigations. I was arrested twice in a 5-week period early this year, and I’ve posted bail 8 times in about 3 months. In order to travel, I have to post more than P500,000 in bonds. 

Journalism is not a crime. 

Yet, I’ve seen social media and our legal system weaponized against us – and any other perceived critics of government. 

We hold the line. Because we live our mission. Because – as Time Magazine wrote – we are the Guardians of Truth.

This battle for truth is the battle of our generation.  

Now more than ever, we know that information is power. Without the right information, it’s impossible to fight back – whether it’s to find a cure for a disease or to hold power to account.

We need to fight the insidious manipulation social media technology platforms have allowed: where lies laced with anger and hate spread faster than facts.  

These lies are like a virus that has infected our information ecosystem, playing to the worst of human nature, turning us against each other. They replicate and cripple our body politique – spreading a disease that still has no cure.  

A lie told a million times becomes a fact. Without facts, we don’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust.  

This is why democracy is broken, not just in the Philippines but around the world. 

I’d like to share 3 lessons with you as you go into battle for your identity, your profession, our democracy. 

Embrace your values because with that comes your humanity.
Embrace your fears.
Embrace your journey.  
Embrace your values 

Remember why you chose to become a doctor. 

You chose a specialized degree that has an embedded mission for a broken society. Seven out of 10 Filipinos die without ever seeing a doctor, and the statistics promise you no sleep — like: only 3 public doctors for every 100,000 people.

To those who chose business, how are you going to fight corruption? 

Life is all about making choices. That’s what we do every minute of the day. 

These little choices define who you are, and if you’re not clear about your values, you may wake up when you’re older and realize you don’t like the person you’ve become. 

Every choice defines who you are, and they could be really simple like choosing to turn right instead of left – they lead to different paths. Or accepting a bribe because in your mind you’ve rationalized it as a gift.  

Character is created in the sum of all these little choices we make.  

Now, while you’re sitting there before going into battle, choose the values that define you. Do it now. Because when you’re tested – and it will come if it hasn’t already – you have to know the lines you’ve set. 

Draw the line: on this side you’re good; on this side you’re evil.  

This is what prevents situational ethics. This makes sure you can’t rationalize bad behavior. 

You don’t really know who you are until you’re forced to defend it. Then every battle you win, or lose, every compromise you choose to make…or to walk away from – all these struggles define the values you live by and, ultimately, who you are. 

Then when you’re in battle, avoid the hate: the US against THEM, rich vs poor, dilawan vs DDS – these labels are meant to divide us. Populism is easy. Real leadership is not.  

Find what we all have in common. That’s our humanity. 

Alone we accomplish very little – no matter how bright or talented you are. It’s about what we can do together, to find what binds us together. 

We build a stronger democracy by strengthening our common humanity.  Embrace your fears 

I’ve been asked a lot in the past year: are you afraid? Of course, I’ve had those moments! But CNN trained me to be a conflict reporter, a war zone correspondent. I plan the way in and chart the way out of any field of battle. 

What I’ve learned is that fear spreads and is debilitating. Fear is a luxury.  

If you’re in the middle of chaos, you need to stamp down your fear to have clarity of thought – that’s essential to make the right decision. The way to do that is the 7Ps: “Proper preparation prevents poor performance.”

So I go back to what I learned in school. Fear is your worst enemy. It stops you from doing what you want.  

Whatever you’re most afraid of, touch it. Hold it. Embrace it. Because once you do that, nothing can stop you.  

In my case, dealing with the fear really started last December. That was when Time Magazine named me person of the year – one of the guardians of truth – and I realized I was the only one among us who was then both alive and free. That was the seed. 

Then last April at the launch of the Clooney Foundation’s Trial Watch, for some reason, it became real. I realized I could go to jail – 63 years, in fact, as Amal Clooney pointed out. I was on a panel: Mohamed Fahmy, who was jailed in Egypt for 438 days, was to my right. Jason Rezaian, who was jailed in Iran for 544 days.  

I talked to them. I read their books. Could I endure what they went through? 

What is the worst case scenario I could imagine.  

Then I embraced it. And robbed it of its power.

Prepare for the worst, and hope for the best. 

Embrace your journey

The founders of Rappler – 4 of us, women in our 50s now – well, we joke that we jumped off the cliff. In the Philippines, we’re the only news group whose business is created and controlled by journalists. That’s what we mean by independence. 

So it’s not a surprise that we would continue doing the story, even if – and especially if – it’s bad for business. Yet, despite that, we found a new business model that has our revenues up significantly since last year. We’ll take the risk to do the stories that matter.

The first casualty in our country’s war for truth is exactly how many people have died in our brutal drug war. The police admit they killed more than 6,000 people – rolled back by PDEA right before SONA to 5,600. But human rights groups and the UN estimate that at least 27,000 people were killed from July 2016 until December last year.  

Our impunity series looks at the lives behind these numbers. We fight impunity on two fronts: the Philippine government in extrajudicial killings and the exponential lies on social media – Facebook, which is essentially our internet. 

Facebook is the world’s largest distributor of news, but it ignored the responsibility that comes with that – the gatekeeping powers of journalism, that determines the quality of our democracies around the world. 

I don’t know where any of this will end. Like I said, we jumped off the cliff by standing up for our values, by upholding the mission of journalism, and holding the powerful to account. 

Facebook is our frenemy: Rappler is one of its 3 fact-checking partners in the Philippines, but finding the lies is a game of whack-a-mole. What’s more important is to find the networks of disinformation that spread the lies – and in that you see how all this is connected to geopolitical power play. In our digital forensics, we’ve shown links to the alt-right in Canada, to the alt-right in the US, to Europe, and to Russian disinformation. 

Embrace your journey. And don’t forget to have fun. 

I am daily inspired by our team in Rappler, their spirit, their sense of mission. Despite the threats we face, we are living our ideals now. This is our reality.

What you do today matters.  

You will help define what our society will look like and how our democracy will survive and evolve.  

This is a time of creative destruction. Even as we see what’s being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now.  

Let’s make sure it’s the future we want.  

Get ready for battle. Embrace your values and your humanity. Embrace your fears and embrace the journey. Class of 2019, our hopes are with you. It’s going to be tough but I know you will change the world for the better.",0
12,Maria A. Ressa,"It’s time to ask yourself a question we’ve lived with for years now: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth?
Silence is complicity. 

The blatant abuses of power are now codified into law. It happened in June: a regional trial court’s order changing the period of prescription for libel from 1 year to 12 years; the shutdown of ABS-CBN; and the quick passage of the Anti-Terror Law, under which a critical voice can be named a terrorist, arrested without a warrant, and jailed for up to 24 days. 

The walls are closing in. 

The Philippines is at the precipice. There’s no need to declare martial law because the very processes of democracy have been turned against it. We now live in a time that is “worse than martial law.”

It’s democracy’s death by a thousand cuts. 

The way we at Rappler have survived 4 years of attacks is by: 

1. Shining the light: Name it and demand signatures to these abuses. If we can’t get justice now, we will later. History is on our side. 

2. More hard-hitting journalism: Continue to hold the powerful to account and demand accountability for the people. Of course, the more we do that, the more the full power of the State is turned against us.

3. More innovation: We continue to explore and to build at a time of creative destruction. The Lighthouse, rolling out this week, is our latest experiment and  provides a beacon to safer shores. (Read: How Lighthouse gave us hope)

Hatred, arrogance, and incompetence can only affect you if you let it. The battle begins in our minds. (Read: Rappler ends 2019 with income: A comeback year) 

While I hate being the government’s cautionary tale, I’m not afraid. It made me stronger, solidified the values I believe in, made me draw the line I cannot cross. I will defend the mission of journalism as long as we are a democracy because press freedom is the foundation of every right of every Filipino under our Constitution. My job is to hold up the sky so our journalists can do their work. 

It’s time to ask yourself a question we’ve lived with for years now: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth? I am at peace with my answer.

Everyone who speaks comes under attack on social media, once an enabler, now a tool for oppression. Be prepared for it. Accept this will happen. Social media is now a behavioral modification system. 

We’re demanding accountability as well from the social media platforms, but Lighthouse is also an experiment to see how tech can serve journalism and democracy. Please test it and give us your feedback. 

We can’t do this alone. The impunity of power is brazen, and the battle has now come to every Filipino. (Read: ABS-CBN’s battle is also ours)

We’re not alone. What’s happening in the Philippines is happening globally. In 2018, I laid out 6 action points for the international community. 

Many of you know I spent nearly two decades working outside the Philippines (and recently had a chance to celebrate #CNN40 with my former colleagues). After the June 15 conviction on cyber libel, 60 press freedom organizations around the world came together to help independent media survive in our country. Please consider signing this petition to help me stay out of jail. #JournalismIsNotACrime

When facts are under attack, journalism is activism. Help us #HoldTheLine for our rights. 

Use it or lose it.

13,Maria A. Ressa,"Technology and the pandemic have destroyed our old world and are forcing all of us to actively create a new one. We need to act now.'
Right before America votes, I can’t help but think we are underestimating the impact of technology on our behavior. Behavioral research has long shown that we vote, not based on what we think, but on how we feel. Now imagine that in today’s information ecosystem, which uses neuroscience and predictive analytics to shape our behavior. It’s an extractive business model that allows “fake news” to flourish.

Technology upended journalism, pitting evidence-based news organizations against propaganda, hate speech, and conspiracy theories. Mocha and QAnon won; news lost. That’s what the data shows. 

For about a decade now, technology has been a tsunami, devastating and reshaping industries: music (Apple, Spotify), hotels (Airbnb), transportation (Uber, Grab), and so many more. News organizations lost their gatekeeping roles to technology. That upended the information ecosystem and the distribution of facts. It began to reshape systems of governance and change the geopolitical power balance. 

The new gatekeepers had easy confidence because they cut the world into quantifiable pieces – never mind if it isn’t true, and never mind the consequences.

Move fast, break things
Decades back, I remember asking questions the engineers couldn’t answer about the impact of their choices on society: on personalization; the lies that you can only mute or block; the unintended consequences of “friends of friends” growth.

Personalized recommendations moved from whatever you searched for (that followed you for weeks online) to personalized news feeds. The question I asked then: how can we all have our own different realities? How can news exist in a world like that? If there is no shared public reality, no shared facts, then democracy as we know it is dead.

Lies that you can only mute or block drive me crazy as a journalist. Because they stay and continue to spread: the more salacious, the faster the spread. Emotions, like anger and hate, spread faster too. That alone showed the abdication of responsibility of the new gatekeepers and how little respect they had for the public.
This played right into long-running Russian military tactics which the public saw in Crimea in 2014. Called the firehose of falsehood, Russian propaganda is meant to “entertain, confuse, and overwhelm.” Fast forward a few years, and now you have leaders of democracies, elected with the help of social media, mimicking the same tactics, like President Rodrigo Duterte or President Donald Trump.

How every social media platform uses algorithms recommending friends of friends to grow your network and their user base. Except that one seemingly minor decision, while good for growth, also built filter bubbles and divisiveness – us against them thinking – into the platforms distributing the news and consequently, into our societies.
These 3 practices and many more are part of a god’s eye-view of data, where content is neither good nor evil, and the goal of accumulating data above all feeds the business model of predictive behavioral analysis, the cornerstone of what Shoshana Zuboff calls “surveillance capitalism.”

One root cause
In her groundbreaking book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, this Harvard emeritus professor argues that many of the problems we’re dealing with today – the weaponization of social media, the destruction of data privacy and security, our inability to hold technology platforms to account – are all part of the same problem: the extractive business model which is insidiously manipulating us without our knowledge. 

Working with Shoshana in The Real Facebook Oversight Board, I’ve put words to my experiences, like “radical indifference” – what she calls “an asocial framework” for evaluating data because in this world, all data is equal. The key is volume, not quality. This is the core of “fake news” – strip branding from news organizations, which differentiate between fact and fiction. In this world, lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and further than boring facts. (READ: The Spread of True and False News Online)

So what do we do about this? Our solution in Rappler is 3-fold, aligned with our founding principles: 1. Demand accountability from technology; 2. Protect and grow investigative journalism; and 3. Build community and civil society. (READ: As democracy dies, we build a global future) 

Build better
This month, the Information and Democracy Forum will be releasing 4 papers from our infodemics working group that former EU Parliament member Marietje Schaake and I co-chair. We recommend policy frameworks around 4 structural challenges: the transparency of digital platforms; the meta-regulation of content moderation; the platform design and reliability of content; and mixed private and public spaces on closed messaging services. 

We see this as a jump-off point for governments, technology companies, and civil society organizations to begin a much needed public discussion with academics, lawyers, and journalists. 

Technology and the pandemic have destroyed our old world and are forcing all of us to actively create a new one. Defining the problem, bringing in all who need to help solve it – these are only the first steps to make sure we create the world we want.

Regardless of who wins the US elections, we need to act now.",0
14,Maria A. Ressa,"Here are 3 battle fronts for a global response – lessons from the Rappler trenches (and how we’re helping build the future now)'
Silicon Valley’s sins have come home to roost. What happened in countries like the Philippines is now threatening US elections. That’s why about a month before the November 3 vote, I joined Carole Cadwalladr, the British journalist who broke the Cambridge Analytica story, and 22 other industry experts in The Real Facebook Oversight Board – “an emergency intervention aimed at Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook employees.”

Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, kicked off our launch on October 1, 2020. “Our group has come together for one purpose: we demand comprehensive action to ensure that Facebook cannot be weaponized to undermine the vote and with it American democracy,” she said. 

We fear it may be too late. Learn our lessons from the Philippines. It’s strange when you begin to see a dystopian future and count the forks in the roads not taken. And you begin to understand how Cassandra and Sisyphus felt. 

PH: First domino to fall
Democracy is dying. That was what I told Facebook in August 2016; what I repeated 4 months later to journalists at the Google NewsLab in Mountain View; and what I said in every keynote around the world, in every award acceptance speech in the past 4 years. 

Lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and farther than boring facts on social media. A lie told a million times becomes a fact. Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust. Without all 3, democracy as we know it is dead.  The Philippines was the first domino to fall in 2016, followed a month later by Brexit. As Rappler’s business and technology leader, an investigative journalist, and the target of government attacks, I lived through the different strands that led us here. 

After all, Rappler started on Facebook in 2011. We saw its best and are now living through its worst. Frenemies, I call us. Rappler was among the first to see the problem and worked quietly behind the scenes, but we had a responsibility to tell our public how they are being manipulated. In 2016, we did stories about the impunity of two men: Rodrigo Duterte and Mark Zuckerberg. 

Now I am horrified to watch what is happening as Americans prepare to vote, worried about the campaigning already happening on Facebook for our 2022 presidential elections. 

Without facts, how can any nation have integrity of elections? Does free will even exist with constant, insidious manipulation? 

Learn from our experience in the last 4 years. This is how power shapes reality and destroys trust. With the help of Silicon Valley. 

Machine manipulates us
In 2016, Rappler documented and tracked the data and influence operations: the attacks began after we exposed the pro-Duterte propaganda machine seeding attack narratives like “journalist equals criminal.” 

In 2017, that same message bottom up came top down when President Duterte attacked Rappler in his State of the Nation address. A little more than a week later, we received our 1st subpoena.

In 2018, the law was weaponized: 11 complaints and cases were filed against me and Rappler. 

In 2019, I was arrested twice in a 5-week period and forced to post bail 8 times in about 3 months to stay free and keep doing my job. 

In 2020, I was convicted of cyber libel for a story we published 8 years ago, one I didn’t write, edit, or supervise at a time when the law we supposedly violated didn’t even exist. Yet, a former colleague, Rey Santos, Jr, and I can go to jail for up to 6 years. 

Social media is now a behavior modification system, and we are Pavlov’s dogs. 

We input our atomized selves, and for each post, machine learning builds a model of who we are: it knows us better than our family and friends, better than we know ourselves. Then artificial intelligence takes our most vulnerable moment to a message and sells it to the highest bidder. It could be a company or a country. This pattern of insidious manipulation creates its own feedback loop that keeps the machine learning and growing. 

Cheap state-sponsored armies on social media are in at least 70 countries around the world in 2019, according to the Oxford University Computational Research Project. It is a scorched-earth policy for power and money, now part of the global dictator’s playbook.  We fought back and survived the last 4 years by understanding the data and by realizing how social media abdicated responsibility to protect the public sphere. We built our response on the 3 pillars of Rappler: technology, investigative journalism, community. 

Here are 3 battle fronts for a global response – lessons from the Rappler trenches (and how we’re helping build the future now): 

TECHNOLOGY: The world’s largest distributor of news today is Facebook. Yet, it is biased against facts, biased against journalism at a time when journalists are under attack on at least 2 fronts: our credibility and business model. This is the first priority because we have to stop the virus of lies from coming into our information ecosystem.

Here in the Philippines, we’re helping build technology that will protect users and allow a thinking slow process critical to democracy. This is Lighthouse.

Globally, we need policy solutions. This is why former EU Parliament Member Marietje Schaake and I are co-chairing the steering committee of experts from academe, human rights, technology, and law for structural solutions to deal with this “infodemic.” The initiative has received strong support from nearly 50 foreign ministers from the Alliance of Multilateralism, and is expected to release potential structural solutions in November.

JOURNALISM: Facts must survive, and experiments for the distribution of news must continue, even while the cleanup of social media platforms begin. Independent news organizations must survive this crisis of confidence and trust as well as the continuing assault on its advertising business model.

In the Philippines, Rappler is taking the processes we use for our investigative journalism into disinformation networks, and building them into a product. This is part of the reason that despite the attacks, Rappler not only survived, we thrived. Every company is vulnerable to manipulation and attacks in the age of social media, and aside from dashboards, companies need to pivot and learn to combine structured and unstructured data with the latest technology to protect itself and to build community.

When the law is used to attack journalists, the defense is not just local, it’s global, because it links directly to issues of rule of law and international law. Aside from our Filipino lawyers led by Francis Lim at ACCRA and Ted Te at FLAG, Rappler receives pro bono legal support from Covington & Burling, LLC. Our international team is led by human rights lawyers Amal Clooney and Caoilfhionn Gallagher, QC.

Globally, only 0.3% of development funds go to media, and independent news groups will need help to survive the next few years of our information dystopia. This is why there is an effort to get an International Fund for Public Interest Media established: $1 billion annually raised and distributed globally in a transparent manner. Luminate and BBC Media Action’s James Deane are leading this charge; I am part of its Advisory Group.

COMMUNITY/CIVIC ENGAGEMENT: Rappler’s elevator pitch in 2012 is “we build communities of action.” This changes when it becomes dangerous to speak your mind or when communities can’t tell fact from fiction.

In the Philippines, Rappler continues to grow MovePH, our younger communities of action centered around climate change, fact-checking, gender equality, and health. Since 2018, our communities rallied around our values of speaking truth to power and demanding accountability, and our crowdfunding campaign has helped pay our exponential legal fees.

Globally, journalists and press freedom groups around the world have come together to help Rappler shine the light on abuses of power in the Philippines. Nearly 80 civil society organizations are in the #HoldTheLine Coalition, led by 3 amazing women: Courtney Radsch from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ); Julie Posetti from the International Center for Jounalists (ICFJ); and Rebecca Vincent from Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Let me end the way I began with our most effective civic engagement at this moment in time: the Real Facebook Oversight Board – when journalists, academe, civil rights activists, and government officials past and present made clear demands for immediate reforms to help ensure the integrity of facts and elections. Within our first 24 hours, Facebook acted. 

The worst public health crisis in a century and the death of facts enabled the consolidation of power by populist authoritarian leaders. 

It’s clear now that what happens in the Philippines does not stay in the Philippines.

It’s a brave, new world: like the virus, like climate, the battle for truth – for democracy – is global. 

It’s time we start building the future we want, eyes wide open.",0
15,Maria A. Ressa,"Why Lighthouse? Because journalists shine the light, and a lighthouse is a beacon showing travelers the way to safe harbor.'


Embrace your fear: a lesson I learned when I was young, now even more relevant as we enter week 8 of a pandemic lockdown.

That’s what Rappler learned to do after nearly 4 years of government attacks – from the weaponization of social media in 2016 to the 11 politically motivated cases filed against us in 14 months.

For me that meant seriously thinking about jail. Last year, I was arrested twice and detained, forced to post bail 8 times to stay free. Taken cumulatively, Amal Clooney tells me the charges carry over 100 years in prison. As a consolation, Ted Te reminds me the most I need to serve is 40 years.

I am not a criminal. I am a journalist. 

Yet, this is what it takes to be a journalist in the Philippines today. Submit, accept a Damocles’ sword over your head, censor yourself, or be punished. Well, I never did like bullies, and I’ve learned that you define who you are when you’re tested. When we at Rappler look back a decade from now, we will know we did everything we could to protect our democracy.

So I touched my fear and learned to embrace it. Once you do that, you rob it of its power. We at Rappler imagined worst case scenarios, planned, and drilled for them.

Little did we know our planning would prepare our organization for this pandemic. (READ: #CourageON: All in…together!)

Courage comes from action

Left alone against brutal and immense power, we learned that the real battle is in our minds. You lose when you allow fear and panic to rule.

What kept us grounded was our deliberate effort to strengthen our mission of hard-hitting investigative journalism, not just to be reactive or defensive. After you embrace your fear, what’s next?

You build for the future. You imagine the world as it should be, and you create.

Enter Lighthouse, technology in the hands of journalists, trained to protect the public sphere where democracy thrives. (READ: Introducing Lighthouse: Rappler’s new platform)  

The process of imagining the future fueled our hope. We had tried agile development in 2015 but failed. This time with a mindset to learn, we turned to experts, and slowly, this new way of thinking and solving problems began to seep into our organization. We began to work more collaboratively, combining the top-down journalists’ workflow with the atomized bottom-up tech workflow. 

When I was arrested in March last year, I was thinking of new ways to use natural language processing or how we turn words into data – and many more problems that kept my imagination active. It was only peripherally that I realized there were 7 police in the van driving me from the airport to the precinct, and 4 of them were in full swat combat gear. (Really? I thought.) It was a great way to learn anger management.

Why Lighthouse? Because journalists shine the light, and a lighthouse is a beacon showing travelers the way to safe harbor. 

After the lockdown, it’s not a surprise that groups like the TOWNS Foundation, which raised P60 million and delivered its 100,000th PPE, personal protective equipment, to Cebu last week said they were inspired by action. Or Ken Abante and his 50+ volunteers who monitor weekly where the emergency budgets are going. Or MovePH,  its fact-checking initiatives, and Project Lifeline. 

Hope comes from courage. In a pandemic, where does hope come from? From the courage of our frontliners. From the courage of our people. 

As leaders gain more power around the world to deal with the crisis, we need to be vigilant that we don’t permanently give away our hard-earned freedoms. 

Despite the tragic global death toll, we know the worst is yet to come as workers and companies stave off bankruptcy and fight to survive.

It’s fitting that we introduce Lighthouse on World Press Freedom Day. When lies can kill, facts matter. Accountability is more important today than ever. Our lives depend on it so #CourageON!",0
16,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT (Part 1)

At the IMF, countries are represented by their central banks in the International Monetary and Financial Committee while the finance or development ministers constitute the joint Development Committee to advise both the World Bank and the IMF mostly on issues related to economic development in emerging and developing countries. In particular, governance issues of central banks have often been the focus of lively debates at the IMF. 

Just last week, the Fund’s Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department Tobias Adrian guested at the Bank of Thailand’s (BoT) Annual Retreat. His remarks focused on central bank independence and why it’s needed and how to protect it.

Adrian’s appearance at the BoT could not have been more auspicious in the face of a running conflict between Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s efforts “to exert more control over the country’s central bank after repeatedly clashing with the monetary authority on economic policy,” as reported by Bloomberg two weeks ago.

No less than Srettha himself who admitted seeking advice from former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra on economic policy. And what kind of advice would Thaksin give to Srettha on monetary policy, for instance, other than what he demanded from the BoT during his time? Thaksin’s populist streak pushed him to pressure the central bank to adjust monetary policy and prioritize economic growth over the central bank’s mandate to manage inflation.

What is bad for Thailand is that its new leadership right from the start in September 2023 announced that it was aiming to accelerate economic recovery and ease taxpayers’ financial burdens. During the same month, the BoT decided to jack up its policy rate for the 8th straight time to 2.5 percent, the highest in a decade. This tightening mode was sustained at its November 2023 meeting.

Srettha, who is concurrently finance minister, openly requested a rate cut from the start of 2024 and as Nikkei Asia reported, even summoned BoT Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput to his office on Jan. 10. He even disclosed to the media that he suggested to the central bank head to have more frequent coffee even at the BoT headquarters. Nobody can deny it was an open attempt by the head of the Thai government to meddle with the central bank.

But Sethaput who graduated from Yale was not new in the public service. He was more than equipped and experienced to stand his ground that easing monetary policy when inflation remains an issue is just wrong. The BoT kept the rate unchanged at its Feb. 7 meeting.

Recognizing the independence of the BoT did not prevent Srettha from suggesting that “it should not ignore people’s suffering.” The problem with the Thai Prime Minister is that he’s arguing from nothing. He wanted a rate cut because he believed the Thai economy is in crisis. BoT’s view is contrary to Srettha’s: “domestic demand continues to expand…key factors hindering growth outlook to be external and structural.” It’s pointless to reduce interest rates because growth is emasculated by falling exports due to China’s own economic slowdown and low labor productivity. 

The BoT is also concerned that should interest rates are reduced, the Thai baht is likely to weaken. If they start easing before the US Fed, that action could lead to investors dropping Thai assets in favor of foreign assets, and trigger baht selling in a big way. That is inflationary. Srettha does not seem to cover this ground.

Another concern of the BoT is its pride as an independent central bank, something that not all central banks may be steadfast to defend at all costs. Beyond pride, the BoT is correct in its assessment that if the financial market begins to perceive it as being soft on preserving its independence, such could lead to what they call “double baht-selling.” That is injurious to the Thai economy, that is suicide for the central bank. 

Clearly the Thai government appears focused narrowly on short-term stimulus measures because its eyes are on the next election. On the other hand, the central bank and its veteran staff would always be the gatekeepers of long-term stability of the economy. There is bound to be a delineation between politics and economic vision. 

Thus, Adrian’s remarks are timely and they must be inspiring for those in the trenches at the BoT. He had a number of very precious messages to the central bankers in Bangkok.

First, he talked about setting the stage. Central banks face tremendous pressure from politics because as monetary policy had to be tightened due to the post-pandemic inflation, economies slowed down, unemployment rose and fiscal position worsened. Their balance sheets bloated by the amount of support they extended to their governments. The financial institutions that they regulate are now demanding that they should also live up to the same standards of governance, risk management and transparency that central banks require of them.

Second, independence remains necessary even as some sectors called for greater oversight of central banks. Who supervises central banks? Empirical evidence is clear that higher central bank independence is associated with lower inflation.

Adrian quoted the US Council of Economic Advisers’ blog about the US Fed as a classic example of the supreme value of independence. Even as actual consumer price inflation had exceeded the target two percent, inflation expectation has broadly been steady at two percent because the US Fed is perceived to be independent and therefore its monetary policy remains credible and effective in combatting inflation.

What are the metrics of an independent central bank?

In his remarks, Adrian indicated that together with his co-authors, Lev Menand of Columbia University and Ashraf Khan of the IMF, they collaborated to produce a new global index for central bank independence. Ten metrics have been developed aimed at helping central banks and policy makers strengthen central bank independence. (To be concluded next week).",0
17,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND FOREST Certainly it was exhilarating news last Sunday, that decision of Fitch Ratings to affirm the Philippines’ investment grade rating at BBB, a notch above the minimum investment grade. Equally significant is the stable outlook that Fitch maintained for the country.


Such a rating action of one of the three major credit rating agencies rewards us for all the efforts of government, business and the rest of the civil society to address the debilitating economic scarring of the pandemic a few years ago and to come to grips with the thinning fiscal space. We did not do badly in achieving respectable economic growth, bringing down inflation and mopping up slippages in public finance.


The marching order  is to deliver on this recent favorable credit rating.


Fitch has a list of the Philippines’ macro strengths as well as structural weaknesses. Keeping the BBB label and stable outlook  means Fitch recognizes our strong medium-term growth. The significance of such an outlook hinges on our ability to reduce government debt to GDP ratio in the next few years. And for us, the imperative of securing cheap and reliable energy, good governance, strong connectivity throughout the islands and optimizing our demographic advantage.


What sets us back? 


We have a low GDP per capita which signals sustained demand for resources to fund various social amelioration projects away from infrastructure and to us, debt servicing ability. Fitch also argues that governance standards are weaker than those of its BBB peers even as it agrees World Bank indicators of good governance could be overdoing it.


On growth prospects, Fitch shares the World Bank’s cautious optimism with its 5.8-percent GDP forecast for 2024. It was correct for Fitch to have attributed last year’s slowdown to the growth-boosting, pandemic-mitigating public expenditure and high inflation. Spending on the pandemic is dissipating this year while high price pressure restrained private consumption and investment. While El Niño could be bad for agriculture, power and water supply as it was, La Niña could also limit business activities in the second half of 2024. 


The challenge to our policymakers? 


Fitch expects this medium-term expectation to be supported by what it calls “large” investment in infra and reforms to foster trade and investment, including renewed interest in public-private partnership (PPP). 


A good plank to this positive growth outlook is gradual fiscal consolidation. Fiscal sustainability ensures continued infrastructure and social services that all should result in stronger business activities. Higher fiscal deficit is not per se bad, as long as growth is secured and a fiscal consolidation plan is in place. Well, the Philippines is into it, and the remaining task is to pursue it, and pursue it well.
Fitch in this latest watch believes “there is some risk of a further fiscal slippage given the government’s continued focus on economic growth and the approach of mid-term elections in May 2025.” Fitch implicitly hopes that the focus on tax administration will produce good results.


We have time and again pointed out that keeping public spending at 60 percent of GDP, or below, secures our overall economic well-being. This is basically the same message of Fitch to the authorities. If this is delivered, then Fitch is justified in saying that our debt profile is stable. 


On external payments position, Fitch zeroed in on the current account deficit which is indicative of an emerging country’s reliance on foreign saving. Fitch says it is narrowing, and its expectation is that it will drop to below 2.0 percent of GDP by next year from last year’s 2.6 percent. This is very achievable with the continuing growth of the economy and the harnessing of indigenous, renewable power sources. 


Fitch also considered the country’s external financing as favorable because it comes from long-term borrowing and foreign direct investment (FDI). The latest good news is that our gross international reserves (GIR) hit a historic high of $105 billion in May. This should further convince the credit rating agency of the country’s strong ability to repay its external obligations.


For obvious reason, Fitch recognized that inflation pressures are moderating. While upside risks continue to threaten price stability, the BSP’s initial success in inflation management was apparent with the sustained retreat of core inflation since 2023 up to May 2024. Contrary to some views, the BSP’s hawkish monetary policy is yielding good results. The challenge is to intensify on those non-monetary measures including stronger supply chains and lower but time-varying tariff duties on imported commodities.


Fitch also commended the BSP’s inflation-targeting framework and flexible exchange-rate regime. They are sound, and they are credible. The government’s use of BSP resources during the pandemic was controlled and shortly reversed while the calls for generalized fuel subsidies were justifiably resisted.   


Finally, Fitch observed that the Marcos Jr. administration “has continued to advance structural economic reforms with the overarching aim of catalyzing private investment.” Much space for growth has been gained with the improvements introduced in the PPP law, Foreign Investment Act and Public Service Act. If this commitment to sustain game-changing economic reforms is upheld, we have a good chance of going back to the old growth path prior to the pandemic of 2020.


Fitch rating action also showed some rating sensitivities. In the first place, a stable outlook means stable, neither an upgrade nor a downgrade is forthcoming. But the stable outlook could also turn positive if strong adherence to macroeconomic sustainability is maintained, fiscal and debt metrics show constant improvements relative to GDP and finally, governance standards are firmed up. 


While this recent affirmation from Fitch is good news, the challenge is without doubt to deliver on those macroeconomic concerns that could bring about better future for our country and people. 


There is an enchanting whole new world of difference when we are rated A or A-. It means we have attained that level of growth that job opportunities are more plentiful and lower inflation promotes higher purchasing power for our people. ",0
18,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT It was the American political scientist Hans Morgenthau who proposed that the word “equilibrium” is equivalent to “balance.” Nothing is more important than ensuring the stability of the whole while preserving the independence of its components. In its global application, we have an equilibrium when nations are not only independent, but they are also entitled to exist. 

From its perspective, China believes regional stability may be preserved despite the assertion of its territorial claims over parts of the South China Sea that belong to and are within the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. That is not just bullying, it is also an outright violation of the UN Charter that prohibits “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”

Ironically, the UN Security Council can play double standard, or engage in doublespeak, by a unilateral veto of any intervention even against their own belligerent action. We saw this type of violations by the United States’ invasion of Iraq, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its war against Ukraine, and of course, China’s hostile presence in the South China Sea. National sovereignty was without question violated without any obvious consequence. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China can seem to get away with its territorial adventurism. 

As proof, China dismissed the 2016 arbitral ruling in favor of the Philippines “null and void.” In fact, China continues to deal with maritime visitors in the South China Sea with lasers and water cannons. It has standing regulation authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain “trespassers” to its claimed territories including the traditional fishing ground of Filipino fishermen. 

What is pathetic is China’s argument that it is the Philippines that is compromising regional stability by involving another great power. China badly needs shadows and mirrors to realize it is arguing on technicality. When a big power like China can afford to ignore rules-based arbitral ruling and insist on its own definition of what falls under its own territorial jurisdiction, the only way to prevent territorial adventurism is precisely to establish international alliances. Without such a counterweight, China could very well secure a wholesale title over practically the whole of South China Sea.

China could afford to throw its weight around the world because since 1978 when it started to open up to the world, its GDP growth has averaged more than nine percent every year. Over 800 million Chinese people have literally escaped absolute poverty. China is now the largest exporter in the world, a global factory no less. 

At the conclusion of China’s Article IV consultation a week ago, First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath could not have been clearer in describing China’s economic development over the past few decades as remarkable.

With a country of over 1.4 billion people, China is the world’s second biggest market. Its land area covers five time zones and occupies borders with some 14 countries. The world’s third largest country in land area, China is now the second largest economy in nominal output and the largest economy based on purchasing power parity. China is credited with having grown its nominal gross output from just over $150 billion in 1978 to around$18 trillion in 2023. 

It's no puzzle then if China should nurture some ambition to challenge the US’ global leadership. In naval power, China between 2014 and 2018 alone succeeded in launching more vessels than the total number of ships in the German, Indian, Spanish and British navies combined, as Foreign Policy wrote in 2020. 

Xi Jinping’s announcement of a “new era” in 2017 meant that China must “take center stage in the world.” Establishing regional hegemony is a crucial step and this implies that China must assert itself as the dominant player in the Western Pacific. We now see China exerting strong influence in security and economic affairs in the region and neutralizing US alliances. The South China Sea is an excellent showcase of its growing weight in the region and its aspiration in the larger global stage.

But there is one thing that could go wrong for China.

It is their ability to manage the strong headwinds of aging population, weaker investment, and geo-economic fragmentation. These big picture issues translate into slow growth, weak exports and currency, and a deepening property sector crisis. Governance remains an existential issue. With growth dynamics strongly entrenched in China with its extensive and deepening capital markets, China should be able to overcome these risks.

But if China fails the economic test, its global posture may be considered to be nothing more than a paper tiger.

But there is another thing that could go well for China.

It is the US and its western allies themselves. Recently, former IMF Economic Counsellor Raghuram Rajan correctly observed that “the Western alliance itself is fraying.” Self-interest is driving the weakening consensus on economic direction. The US itself, while demanding openness in trade and finance, is doing so based on its own definition of openness. Doublespeak can be easily discerned and it could undermine the US and its Western allies including those in the Asia Pacific.

If this shift in economic power is to be reflected in the IMF and World Bank governance through an appropriate adjustment in country quotas, China may ultimately end up with the largest quota and of course, more extensive influence. Rajan pointed out that under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the Fund’s headquarters may have to move from Washington, DC to Beijing. 

If the Fund persists in its tradition of reforming itself incrementally through modest adjustment in quotas without fundamental changes in governance and management structure, then Beijing would have another platform to pursue its global ambition.

Whether this is going to lead to better political equilibrium will be an open question for some years to come.",0
19,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT Some TikToks say it all. To afford a rare McLaren 620R, worth at least $280,000 or more than ₱16 million, one should get used to living in a farm and running a piggery business. Prepare to live a simple life, grow with your father’s workers and yes, do homeschooling. After a few years, branded jewelry, bags, and dresses worth millions of pesos would complete your ensemble as you ride your own chopper after winning a local election in a small town north of Luzon.

Many have been monitoring the Senate hearing and from all the public declarations of Mayor Alice Guo of Bamban, Tarlac, that is her story. That is her life. Change the details here and there like the McLaren that she said she just borrowed, but keep the details about the simple farm life of her childhood with no personal recollection of her playmates and the mother Amelia Leal that she never saw, and that’s Mayor Guo’s 38 years. 

To be sure, there were more questions than answers that our senators elicited from the Bamban mayor.

Why she could not establish her origin escapes us. She could not recall who raised her up as a youngster,or who taught her at home except a certain Teacher Rubilyn. Her birth was registered only when she was 17, but there was no record of where she was actually born because hospital records are non-existent. Her residential address at best was fictitious. While she claimed her family had embroidery business in Valenzuela, a quick search revealed no such business was ever conducted there. She indicated a home address in Valenzuela but no less than Senator Sherwin Gatchalian belied it. Someone he knew owned the place. Most damning, both the couple whom she claimed as her parents have no existing birth and marriage records in the Philippine Statistics Authority. Whatever questions were thrown at her, Mayor Guo invariably insisted she grew up in the farm, and she lived a simple life.

As Senator Loren Legarda quipped, “para namang may script.”

But the script, although it looks expansive, was rather weak and incoherent because there remained many loose ends in Mayor Guo’s narrative.  Securities and Exchange Commission records show she’s one of the incorporators holding substantial shareholdings in at least 11 companies since 2010. Allegedly born in July 1986, that means she was only about 24 years old when she amassed so much to have organized such a business network. She acquired a helicopter in 2019 at age 33 for an air taxi business but gave it up when the prospects did not reportedly prove promising. She also engaged in car dealership which she allegedly used to justify her ownership of 16 vehicles even as they remained under her name.

Her Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) showed very rapid increase in her net worth. The script failed to provide the mayor with the answer to the questions of the senators on how she accumulated higher net worth in such a short time. 

Let’s be real, we can do a thousand iterations of the piggery or embroidery businesses, car dealership or similar business activities but no way could they yield a combined income to allow Mayor Guo to afford expensive jewelry and much less to finance the purchase of a chopper even for business that ultimately failed, and the 10 hectares of land on which POGO operators built a whole hub of gambling complex.

Before she ran for mayor of Bamban, Guo in September 2020 applied for a license to operate Hongsheng Gaming Technology, Inc. Before she was elected mayor, she claimed she divested from the business. When the same technology company was raided, it had rebranded itself as Zun Yuan Technology. During that raid, a Ford Expedition belonging to Guo was found. Electric bills of the Zun Yuan premises totalling some ₱15 million were charged to Guo herself and that covered the period as recent as September 2023 to February 2024.

Perhaps the script failed to anticipate the discovery of the so-called illegal activities at the POGO hub in Bamban in March 2024. What is suspicious here is that Zun Yuan was located in the Baofu compound just behind the Bamban municipal hall where the mayor holds office. Baofu Land Development that leased the compound to Zun Yuan is owned by no other than the mayor herself. The complex consists of 32 building structures with a reported tunnel structure as an escape route. 

Why the mayor did not even bother to check the extensive POGO operations in her own property is a puzzle to many. The raid established that illegal activities such as human trafficking and illegal detention were done in the mayor’s property. Official reports showed that there are torture chambers in the complex, panic rooms, vaults containing millions of pesos and dollars with confiscated passports of foreign employees. The Bamban POGO was reported doing other business outside its license. Cyber fraud operations were suspected to have been committed.

What is left unsaid, and perhaps it was supposed to be in the subtext of the players rather than in the script, is the motivation of Guo in running for mayor of a second-class municipality where the POGO operations had been in full blast. 

If we go by costs and benefits, it was argued in the Senate that the social and economic costs due to POGO including crimes, tax evasion, foregone foreign direct investments and tourism at some ₱143.3 billion far outweigh the benefits estimated at ₱134.86 billion for allowing POGO. Net cost to the country is more than ₱8.4 billion. 

That is the paradox of POGO but somebody else wrote the script for us.",0
20,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT Bloomberg and online news last Tuesday reported a closing rate of ₱58.27 to a dollar, nearly the same level it did on Nov. 8, 2022, and the worst in 18 months. BSP Governor Eli Remolona emailed media  to explain that “the peso weakened beyond ₱58 to the US dollar today, in line with other currencies in the region. The dollar continued to strengthen as the Federal Reserve signaled delay in cutting interest rates.” 

The governor captured the immediate dynamics of the peso’s weakness but there are more to it, and some could be traced back to the BSP itself.

First of all, no one can fault the US central bank for suggesting that rates may remain higher for longer. It is correct to stay tight because the US economy is robust and resilient, humming with the stock market, while domestic inflation has so far proved stickier at around three percent against the two percent target. 

But we read a different story from the broadsheets last Friday.

The BSP announced that it may start cutting interest rates as early as August for a total of 50 basis points (bps), as “recent inflation uptick was not as bad as expected.” To many observers and media reporters, such a statement sounded less hawkish even after the Monetary Board kept the policy rate steady at 6.5 percent.

Such a statement is not exactly in synch with the BSP press statement issued after the Board meeting the day before. Its penultimate paragraph could not be more than hawkish: “The Monetary Board deems it appropriate to ensure sufficiently tight monetary policy settings until inflation settles firmly within the target range. A restrictive policy stance will also help keep inflation expectations anchored amid a possible buildup in upside risks to future inflation.” 

As to its institutional commitment, the BSP press statement could not have been more steadfast in reiterating that it “remains ready to adjust its monetary policy settings as necessary, in keeping with its primary mandate to safeguard price stability.”

But to say that the BSP “still has room to cut rates before the US Federal Reserve,” up to a possible 50 bps may confirm that the MB meeting was “dovish.” The market’s demand for US dollar soared and we ended up the other day with the peso’s weakest showing in 18 months. 

It is not impossible for some to speculate that monetary policy is less worried about inflation than the prospects of growth. After all, the Development Budget Coordination Committee recently announced lower growth targets of 6 percent-7 percent for 2024 and 6.5 percent-7.5 percent for 2025. 

And domestic inflation seems to be about to break through the inflationary spiral of March 2022-November 2023 with the less-than-expected inflation of 3.8 percent in April 2024. If the May 2024 inflation should turn out less than 4.0 percent, then one can safely say price pressures are losing steam, and the issue boils down to how much stronger are the upside risks the BSP identified during last week’s policy meeting.

As proof, the BSP announced risk-adjusted inflation forecasts of 3.8 percent for 2024 and 3.7 percent for 2025 from 4.0 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. With these solid forecasts, the BSP could have dwelt more on the favorable dynamics of inflation and the impending success of hitting the target after two years. Issuing instead a forward guidance of an August easing when the US Fed looks keen on staying higher for longer is bad timing. After all, a risk-adjusted forecast of 3.8 percent for this year is not exactly “benign.” In our previous lingo at the Board in times past, it is “manageable.” 

If the risks identified as upside risks amplify themselves beyond programmed magnitude, the upper end of the target could easily be breached. 

And here’s the rub: telegraphing to the market the likelihood of an easier monetary policy in the next few months was enough to upset the foreign exchange (FX) market. Therefore, the crash of the peso beyond ₱58 is not exactly unexpected. Moreover, the situation turned for the worse when the BSP admitted that it was intervening less. Unless the BSP once again affirms its strong commitment to checking market volatility and ensuring order in the FX market, the breach in the ₱58 line in the sand could be further extended.

If the peso further weakens over a prolonged period, the exchange rate pass through could begin to kick in, and inflationary tendencies may resurge. What is “manageable” risk-adjusted forecasts for 2024 and 2025 could be easily beaten. Nobody fancies this. 

Yesterday’s report about the country’s April balance of payments deficit of $639 million from March’s surplus of $1.2 billion does not inspire a stable peso. The shortfall derives from the government’s massive debt repayments. Cash remittances from our overseas workers are at best anemic. And the deficit is not true only for the month of April; the first four months of the year also yielded a deficit. 

It would not also help the peso and inflation if at this time that monetary policy should remain cautious against a tight US Fed to talk about a possible reduction in the required reserve ratio (RRR) from 9.5 percent to a possible five percent. That will release hundreds of billions of pesos into the monetary stream. True, a high RRR is distortionary of financial intermediation. But its expansionary effects cannot be discounted at this time when aiming for a lower inflation is still imperative.

On the other hand, the market may wish to read the emerging scenario with more care and give the BSP more credit that it is now seeing an early victory against inflation. Our monetary authorities may just be too excited to share to the business community what it intends to do once inflation is firmly under control, reduce policy rate and then by lowering the RRR, infuse the market with more money.

21,Jose Ma Montelibano,"According to Ping Lacson, it was just a joke, and I accepted it as a joke with a sharp point. After all, the term “designated survivor” had a specific context and meaning after it became the title of a movie. But since a legally designated survivor was the one who said it, I felt the former senator was more right than wrong.

However, the assassination attempt on Donald Trump makes me think about designated survivors again.  Our world today is a most divided and contentious one with generous slices of violence. Assassinations have been happening regularly and the more prominent make global news. Naturally, after the assassinations, the designated survivors emerge.

To put the issue of a designated survivor in the context of politics in the Philippines, one must have to imagine the assassination of the President. But to be more faithful to the movie which popularized the term “designated survivor”, assassinations would not only include the President but those who are identified by law as the next in line. That puts the coming SONA at the top of mind of conspiracy theorists because those next in line to the presidency are expected to be there.

Except the Vice-President, of course, who made the joke that she appointed herself as designated survivor when she said that she will not attend the SONA. If it were not a joke, it would be sinister, almost a criminal threat.

But it is not my intention to talk about designated survivors who are mandated to be such by law, like vice-presidents when presidents are eliminated. Aside from it being a joke, even a bad one in the minds of many, it is a serious distraction to the fate and misery of many Filipinos who are looking for relief. I would rather start a private or public reflection about the way life had arranged for dire circumstances to see heroism from survivors of personal or collective tragedy.

And because a woman brought up the subject of designated survivor, I have brought back to active memory the many women in our history who were caught in dire, often violent, circumstances and saw their husbands and communities become victims of enemies with superior strength and resources. Let me cite a few.

Gabriela Silang. Teresa Magbanua. Melchora Aquino. Heneral Agueda Kahabangan. Trinidad Tecson. These names stand out. But the list is long and full of noble and brave women who went through sacrifice after sacrifice, not for their own glory or position, but for the collective good of women or the Filipino people.

Who can forget Corazon Aquino, the most famous contemporary hero of a designated survivor – from the humble housewife whose family had to suffer the imprisonment of her husband, then his assassination, to restorer of democracy and survivor of coup de états?

What about Pura Villanueva Kalaw who fought historical odds and succeeded in a man’s world, contributing substantially to making it possible for Filipino women to vote?  She survived prejudice and proved her worth over decades of achievements.

Do we remember Maria Orosa who was a celebrated war hero but survived? And then, created a revolution in Filipino cuisine with over 700 recipes?

In 2011, a COA auditor by the name of Heidi Mendoza found the courage to reveal the corruption in the military, and despite death threats, finished her testimony in Congressional hearings. Risking all, Heidi survived but the corruption ring was dismantled. She became the head of COA and moved on to become the Undersecretary General for the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight.

Of course, Maria Ressa comes to mind. After all, the kitchen sink was thrown at her, including the courts. She survived, won the Nobel Peace Award, and continues to be a voice for freedom of expression.

Leila de Lima is a survivor as well. Imprisoned on charges that all were dismissed after the Duterte administration, Leila is saying that those responsible for her unjust imprisonment must be made accountable. Let us wish her luck on her mission of justice.

Lately, I have been pleasantly surprised with former Finance Undersecretary Cielo Magno, terminated for her unsolicited advice about economic principles. Knowing the extreme probability that she would lose her job, she still made public her stand about a flawed presidential decision on controlling rice prices. She preferred to just be a regular professor of economics and lose a good-paying job as a high government official.

Professor Cielo has survived that first salvo against the power of higher authority. She has not stopped at her advocacy for transparency and accountability, albeit doing it mostly on social media and gatherings where she is the resource speaker. But she is also a member of the Open Government Partnership and will, in fact, be co-Chair with that international body at the end of the year.

The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative aimed at securing commitments from national and sub-national governments to promote open government, combat corruption, and improve governance. The OGP is managed by a steering committee that includes representatives from both government and civil society organizations. The Philippines is a founding member of the OGP.   

We, too, citizens of our republic, have been the designated survivors of all the ills and mistakes of our officials. When they leave office, we are left holding the bag of consequences. The examples of the brave and determined women above and many more I could not name must inspire us to not just survive, not just make the most of it, but to be responsible for bringing our nation and future to new heights. That means if corruption and poverty are the monsters we face, we must confront, battle, and defeat them.

We have survived the filth, the stupidity, the greed, the violence, of those who lead us and end up being wolves in sheep’s clothing. The people are always survivors of our nation, and we must honor the privilege of accepting that great responsibility. Not as victims, but as designated survivors with a mission.",0
22,Jose Ma Montelibano,"We are going around in circles. Unfortunately, the circles are spirals, and they are going downwards. I cannot say what lies at the bottom.

I have never been to war like my parent generation, those who lived through World War I and World War II. Luckily, too, I have been spared the worst like those caught in conflict areas where government troops were at war with communist rebels or Muslim insurrectionists. So, I really cannot say how bad things can go at the bottom of the spiral.

At my age, too, while the possibility is there, the odds that I will experience World War III are very slim. Our growing conflict with China is more delicate. If what self-claimed pundits are saying that we are in a proxy war between China and the United States is true, then a nuclear confrontation between the two remains slim as well. The two know it will be the end of their worlds as they know it now.

Beyond our shores, however, there is turbulence that can erupt into pocket wars. If I list down all countries with internal or regional armed conflicts, it will take up too much space. And we are mostly in the know because of the speed and volume of international news available locally – if we are interested. It is enough that we know there are enough trigger points that can light a global fuse leading to World War III. We have less problems in the Philippines in terms of the variety of issues. Almost all our different challenges stem from two major roots – corruption and poverty. Between the two, corruption is the cancer that is metastasizing while poverty is its most visible consequence. Poverty, though, is not only a result; it also plays an active role in deepening and spreading the cancer of corruption.

Because of corruption and poverty, Filipinos are grappling with new cancer growths everywhere as is the case when cancer metastasizes. It used to be that corruption was only in the hands of the Executive Branch, mostly confined to government projects that would favor cronies and demand kickbacks. In other words, they were specific and few. Today, corruption is everywhere and, as a result, is now generally tolerated.

And there lies the most painful and sinister wound – the gradual shift of the very meanings of right and wrong. Our value system, our very soul, must now undergo the perversion of accepting what is wrong and slowly letting go of the strict adherence to what we once regarded as right.

Again, because of my age, notwithstanding my active objections to this lowering or debasing of virtues and principles, I see no hope to see its reversal in my lifetime. However, I see it worsening. It is like a monster set free from its cage and hungry to devour everything and everyone that kept it there. Prayers or hypocritical lip service cannot stop the cancer of corruption. Only a purging can, when it comes.

Going against the odds, however, is not new to me. I would prefer not to. It is always easier to ride the tide for as long as by doing so, I do not create an unbearable inner conflict within my set of beliefs. When I lose hope for myself, it is only in accepting that I may not see in my lifetime the irreversible beginning of meaningful change. Woe to the virtues and values on which our ancestors built the character of the Filipino.

However, I am sure as there is day after night that the moment and process will come. Man cannot defy the natural or divine order without consequence. It is just that my sense of time is not the same as life’s sense of time – like in the popular saying “in God’s time.” Time is not mine and I must let it go. My life and actions, though, are mine and I will pursue what I believe in.

How, then, can I proceed in a mission, the favorable ending of which I do not think I can see? With so little time and resources, I have to move forward like a sniper and let go of the shotgun approach. There is no problem with my motivation. Having long dreamed about an ideal country, it was necessary for me to think of decades, not just years. Despite that, and knowing change comes slowly, I remained motivated.

The cancer of corruption has spread from one place to another, and there is no sure medicine to stop the metastasizing. To save what is left, what comes to my mind is to focus on the healthy cells and organs. They have remained healthy in a very unhealthy environment because of one fact – their immune system. A strong immune system is the first order of the day for me. Its strength must be enhanced to keep resisting the spreading cancer.

I have two target audiences that I can continue to target in my advocacy work. From 1983 in the hills of Quezon to semi-retirement today, I have focused on community development work, the last 22 years as part of Gawad Kalinga. My sanity has been sustained by this work and by a mission that calls for zero poverty, zero carbon, and zero exclusion. This work has kept me beside much younger workers from whom I continue to receive inspiration.

Community development work, however, naturally flows to nation building, a faith and patriotism partnership for me. Thankfully, it is just as true for Gawad Kalinga, its many partners, and armies of volunteers I have engaged with.

Nation building, however, touches on governance. In fact, any work addressing poverty ultimately brings one to governance simply because of the huge numbers and resources involved.

My other audience must be the idealism of mostly younger Filipinos who are the true hope of a brighter tomorrow. I pray that I can encourage them to stay the course.

The poor and the young. So be it.",0
23,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I heard that we have a new Secretary for Education. I wish him well. Less for himself and more for the future of most of the Filipino youth in the public school system. After all, with a learning poverty of 91% and no known diagnosis for the horrible ailment, there is no remedial program as well. Catching up is not enough as those already ahead are moving forward, too, maybe at an even faster clip.

The Department of Education is mandated to provide quality education through the public school system. If I take quality to mean what it is usually described to be, then what may have been the noble dream of quality education has turned out to be a myth. The meanings of myth include the primary one, which refers to a traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining some natural or social phenomenon.

The myth of quality education in the Philippines, however, as I mean it in this article, points to the secondary meaning of what a myth means, which is “a widely held but false belief or idea.”

When Sara Duterte decided to relinquish her role as Secretary of Education, I saw, read, and heard subtle and overt moves to promote specific individuals to the position. I was wondering to myself why people would encourage the ambitious to take over. After all, no one is what qualifications are needed to effectively run the department and reverse the learning poverty we have driven ourselves into. A good administrator might manage the department with greater efficiency which basically means containing the waste of people’s resources by unaddressed corruption and drifting leadership without a doable vision. A good administrator, however, cannot reverse learning poverty without identifying what its pitiful consequences are to our people in their daily lives and what it will do to our future labor force. An insightful, pragmatic, and courageous leader might succeed, if at all.

The World bank’s learning poverty results of 10-year-old Filipinos determined that 91% of them are struggling to read simple text. The struggle to read simple text guarantees our future workers 10 to 15 years from now will still be struggling to read and comprehend, not just simple words, but operational instructions required in the workplace.

In other words, our young students below 10 years old and above 15 years old today are not only failing but falling far behind their counterparts in most of the world, including in Asia. They have been failing before they were 10 years old, and the World Bank studied just caught them at that age. They are also failing and falling behind as 15-year-olds as caught by the PISA (Program for International Student Assessment), situated at the near bottom of all countries assessed.

For these test results to be as shockingly low as these, it means that students are failing but are made to pass, not just as special individuals but as a class. By doing that year after year, our students fall behind and future students enter a system with the lowest of standards.

No wonder that the other finding of the World Bank study immediately pointed to data gathered from classroom observation that determined most teachers in the Philippines use ineffective or weak teaching practices that ultimately translate into poorer learning outcomes. The same World bank studies said that too many teachers have not mastered the content they are expected to teach.

It now is clear, although the government was muted in admitting this, that we not only have a learning poverty but a teaching poverty as well. To understand the problem more clearly, we must look at the key players of education – the students and the teachers. We cannot make our students learn by passing them when they do not deserve to pass. We also cannot make our teachers teach more effectively by increasing their salaries. We are caught in a bind that only an honest realization can unravel.

The sadder thing is that learning and teaching poverty is an indictment of the more powerful sectors responsible – the homes/families in charge before schooling age, and the workplace and government where graduates go after. The families carry serious responsibility for the earliest learning process; businesses and government are just as responsible because they set the standards of those they want to employ.

There is now a Gordian knot, an intricate problem insoluble in its own terms.

Why, then, would anyone want to be the secretary of Education? He cannot solve the problem he faces. In fact, he cannot even begin to imagine the magnitude of the problem unless he or others will call for a national summit to discuss the problem and its impact on the key sectors and industries of the country. There is no way forward without a clear understanding of the ailment – and there is still none.

If we do not have a visionary as Secretary of Education, if we do not have a courageous Secretary of Education who will not bend his best course of action whatever the political cost, if we do not have a population that realizes the impossibility of the problem, if we do not have businesses and employers who will demand the best and invest to bring their workers to greater productivity, if we do not have a presidency that will look 10 to 15 years ahead and risk its whole political future to start producing citizens who are effectively educated and committed to better work ethics, then we will stay holding a heavy bag, a citizenry that is behind everyone else and will keep falling behind.

I know a new Secretary of Education has been named. I know luck is nowhere enough to make him begin a new course for our system of education. Instead, I will pray for him and wish for him the divine inspiration needed to turn a myth into a hopeful reality.",0
24,Jose Ma Montelibano,"Week after week for the past 23 years, I have written my articles for Inquirer.net (started out as INQ7 in 2001). It was never for money, and money was never offered as well. A simple email invitation to write was sent to me by the editor then, timed when the online publication was undergoing major changes. I accepted although I do not remember why. Though not used to regular writing, I suppose it was the temper of the times.

I had zero background for writing other than what a student is taught and learns from grade school to college. I did not seem to have a passion for writing although my teachers thought I wrote well and gave me the grades to affirm it. Through the years, however, from the kind of experiences I had lived through, the kind of influence mentors and friends had on me, and the unique vantage view I always had, a continuing stream of lessons and insights amassed. It is this pool of knowledge and understanding that I draw from, and especially the behavioral principles underlying all of them.

Later, I learned that many writers do not write from an intent to establish it as a professional career. Rather, many write because there is something in them that wants to find the light of day outside their minds and hearts. I am one of them. I write because I have much to write about. And it is not about chismis, either. That is not my line while I do accept many writers have a flair for that type of subject matter. I am aware, too, that more of the Filipino audience gravitate to that for their own personal reasons.

Although I started writing quite late, it has now been 23 years. Just like that and I realize I have written almost 1,200 articles on a weekly basis. If I had the discipline to review the tenor and temper of the articles, especially on the level of lessons and insights drawn from current events layered over past experiences, my views must have evolved. I believe that one’s conclusions may change as people and events add to the richness of reality. But hopefully, the change hardly contradicts and, in fact, enriches. Changing the principles and values that have underpinned me as a human being would be a problem for me if it happens unless that change is for more depth and breadth, for clearer knowledge, and hints of wisdom. I would loathe for me to reverse what I believe in at soul level or behave as if I had. I do not have much capability for ethical and moral calisthenics. Admittedly, I have made compromises along the way – and I have suffered inner shame every time. When I judge others, I give the same leeway, but I hope they suffer, too.

My prelude to writing was the Erap Resign moment of the Philippines. His presidency, or to be more accurate, his presidential behavior was jarring to me as a Filipino wishing that his president would be an inspiration, a symbol of who and what the Filipino is to both the Filipino people and to the world. Not long before that, we had come from the nightmare of dictatorship and institutionalized looting and plunder – the kind that comes from the top and followed gleefully by the smaller thieves in the bureaucracy. My generation and the one before me saw the bankruptcy of the Philippines – and I mean it literally as well as allegorically.

Now, few can imagine what it is to be a financial pariah of the world where the Philippine peso meant nothing in financial transactions and only the US dollar in cash could satisfy those from whom we needed essential items. Our Central Bank had to be closed and a new institution established, known as BSP today. It deserved to be shut down anyway as it was providing false figures on our reserves to help prove lies as truth, one of the earliest and worst incidents of disinformation.

The Cory Aquino and Fidel Ramos presidencies were the first desperate attempts to return the Philippines to normalcy in economics and in politics. More so, I believe, was the excruciating process of taming adventurism in the military and dismantling a culture of corruption. Well, it does seem that two presidencies were not enough because Estrada and the Filipino people had to go through an upheaval again on both fronts.

Are we now okay? No.

Can we now be okay? Can we ever find a governance that approximates the best of our race, the best of our culture, the best of our potential? Yes, but by prayer, by a miracle, and most of all, by the resolve of enough Filipinos to condemn dishonesty in all forms from the top. Because only from the top can come the kind of examples that people all the way to the communities nationwide can get inspiration from. Because only from the top can laws be truly enforced without fear or favor.

But the top fear only the people. So, the first step is the most arduous one, the step that begins with each one, with each family, with each village, with each barangay chairman, with each mayor, with each governor, until Malacañang Palace shakes with the kind of dread that forces reform.

We must instead amend the question to “Can we be okay?” Because if it begins with us, will we? Because if the top does not follow, will we insist?

Yes, but by prayer, by a miracle, and most of all, a resolve of enough Filipinos to condemn dishonesty in all forms beginning from the top. It is a simple question – can we keep condemning until power dreads the consequences?

No, I do not think so. I can only pray that it is inching nearer. I fear, though, if great change is coming, there will be severe, preceding lessons that will make us sorrier, maybe wiser, and braver.",0
25,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I know we cannot progress without a healthy amount of optimism and reasonable clarity of the road forward. But the reality is, we do not have both.

Still, no matter the frustration, the rampant disregard for responsibility from duty, and the utter lack of accountability, we cannot stand still, cry our hearts out, or even storm the streets without a road map and some sense of victory. Suicide is out of the question. But I will welcome it from public officials who will commit seppuku out of shame and dishonor.

It must be my age. In my senior years, I cannot seem to find the serenity of retirement amid impending disaster. If I could have that relative peace after a lifetime of sincere effort to help society find a better national life and brighter future, I will seize it and fade in the sunset.

If I keep my interests contained, my network small, my mobility very limited, I can possibly remain deaf and blind to the horrors that I see and reports of them brought to my attention. And if I care less and choose to love only myself and my family, I need not be concerned about many other things. But then, I remember Spider-Man and his fateful words, “With great power comes great responsibility.” It may be that I do not have that great power, but it may also be that I have. After all, being part of the minuscule minority at the upper crust of Philippine society, to the greater number below born into poverty and struggling through lifetimes to break that curse, I and all like me have great power. Like children, the poor and marginalized look up and see my ilk and class as giants.

It is not uncommon for people in their 70s to wonder and discuss the strange attraction of legacy. Filipinos, especially, cannot seem to separate themselves from the lives of their children, grandchildren, and grandchildren. If we could, we would want to make their lives more safe and comfortable way beyond our own passing. There is one big difference, however, between the rich and the poor. The rich can think of legacy for generations ahead; the poor can think of the next meal, the next paycheck.

I do not have an obsessive urge to save the world. I mean, I would like to, but I know I cannot. Any messianic complex in me is not bloated. It is only proportionate to my understanding of how things can be, of how they are far from their potential. I would like to do much more but my body contracts in capacity. The problem is that my mind has become clearer over time, blessed with experience and many lessons learned. My mentors and gurus would probably tell me, “Let go.”

Of course, I have not only thought about it but have been trying to. Letting go is easy in some departments of life but almost impossible for a few areas. Like in situations of right versus wrong, that eternal conflict that humanity has faced from creation. How do we let go of right and wrong? How do we live out what is right and how do we defy what is wrong? Or good versus bad.

When I look at life before me, all I remember and experienced, all the lessons and insights of those who came ahead, I know that I know much better than before. But most that I know are not complicated; thus, my learning needed less genius, just more common sense. In fact, as I kept learning more, I saw that our forefathers and the forefathers of other races had already seen most of the answers. That is why many among us today yearn for the good old days. Many answers were already there.

It is my honor and a great blessing to be a Filipino. It may be that I have been more privileged than millions of my fellow Filipinos. I must thank the Creator and my parents for that. But, when the time came for me to realize that, indeed, I was privileged, I gave in to my curiosity and tried to understand why most Filipinos had lives less blessed or full of dire challenges. I went out of my way to get to know more Filipinos who were previously strangers to me simply because they were poor. And I realized that they were more representative of who the Filipino is, not me and all like me.

I wonder if I really had a choice to pursue a clear path. The early part was mostly ushered in with little choice on my part. Then, no one forced me out. I could not resist, however. I had to know what was on the other side. I had to open the forbidden door.

If anyone remembers the story of the young Buddha, he only asked why his life was so blessed and why there were many who only knew pain. I heard that story when I was in my late 30s. Strangely, I felt I understood him. Our circumstances were different, but his curiosity felt so familiar. Facing that curiosity, I took a giant leap to find out. Now, I realize that I am still on that same journey of 40 years ago.

So, do I let go? I know I must let go of more of my expectations, of more of my frustrations, but loathe letting go of my aspirations. Additionally, if I see that my aspirations are beneficial to many as well, then even more I do not know how to let go of my aspirations for my people.

It is time to examine the expectations, how much history and past efforts, mine and others’, came close to them. If close enough, then it should be continued with some fine-tuning. If expectations and reality were too far apart, the expectations and the executions must be amended.

Ah, life remains a mystery. As it unfolds, may I still be curious, and adventurous.",0
26,Phind Instant,"For decades, the Philippines has grappled with issues of regional autonomy, resource allocation, and central-local relations. The debate over federalism has been ongoing, with proponents arguing it could address these challenges and opponents citing concerns about stability and effectiveness. As we navigate our nation-building journey, exploring federalism as a potential solution warrants serious consideration.

Proponents of federalism point to several potential benefits:

1. Enhanced regional autonomy: By giving more power to local governments, federalism could address long-standing issues of underdevelopment in certain regions.

2. Improved resource allocation: A federal system might allow for more targeted distribution of funds based on specific regional needs.

3. Increased representation: More direct involvement of local leaders in decision-making processes could lead to better governance.

4. Economic growth: Some argue that federalism could spur economic development by allowing regions to tailor policies to their unique circumstances.

However, critics raise several concerns:

1. Potential for fragmentation: A federal system could lead to increased regional divisions and conflicts.

2. Increased bureaucracy: Managing a more complex political structure could result in higher administrative costs.

3. Risk of corruption: Greater decentralization could potentially increase opportunities for graft and mismanagement.

4. Constitutional challenges: Implementing federalism would require significant constitutional reforms, which can be difficult to achieve.

Despite these challenges, many argue that the benefits outweigh the risks. Several countries with federal systems, such as Germany and Australia, have successfully managed their complexities while achieving strong economic growth and stability.

To address concerns about implementation, experts suggest:

1. Gradual transition: Phasing in federal elements over time rather than implementing full federalism immediately.

2. Clear guidelines: Establishing clear rules and procedures for decision-making at different levels of government.

3. Strong institutions: Ensuring robust checks and balances across all levels of government.

4. Public education: Conducting widespread information campaigns to build understanding and support for federalism.

5. Economic planning: Developing comprehensive economic plans that account for regional differences and potential challenges.

6. International best practices: Studying successful federal systems worldwide to learn from their experiences.

7. Stakeholder engagement: Involving various sectors of society in the discussion and decision-making process.

8. Constitutional reform: Carefully crafting constitutional amendments that balance power between national and local governments.

The path forward requires careful consideration and dialogue among Filipinos. It's crucial that we engage in open, honest discussions about the pros and cons of federalism, listening to experts and ordinary citizens alike.

Ultimately, the choice to adopt federalism should be based on what serves the Philippines' unique needs and circumstances. Whether through full federalization or a hybrid system, the goal should be to create a governance structure that promotes greater equity, efficiency, and responsiveness to citizen needs.

As we explore this complex issue, let us remain committed to our core values as a nation - democracy, justice, and equality. By working together towards a more inclusive and effective system of governance, we can build a brighter future for all Filipinos. The challenge before us is significant, but with wisdom, patience, and collective effort, we can overcome any obstacle and create a Philippines that truly works for everyone.

27,Phind Instant,"Campaign finance transparency is a cornerstone of healthy democracies worldwide. Yet in the Philippines, opaque financing of election campaigns continues to plague the political process. This lack of transparency not only undermines faith in democracy but also creates an uneven playing field where deep-pocketed donors can exert disproportionate influence.

Recent data shows that the 2022 Philippine presidential election cost an estimated PHP 100 billion (approximately USD 1.8 billion), making it one of the most expensive in history. However, much of this spending remains shrouded in secrecy [1].

To address these concerns and ensure fair elections, several key reforms are urgently needed:

1. Strengthen campaign finance laws: Implement stricter regulations on donations and expenditures, including limits on individual contributions and caps on overall campaign spending.

2. Improve disclosure requirements: Mandate detailed reporting of all campaign finances, including sources of funding and specific expenditures.

3. Enhance enforcement: Strengthen oversight bodies to investigate violations and impose meaningful penalties for non-compliance.

4. Promote digital transparency: Utilize technology to create user-friendly platforms for citizens to access campaign finance information easily.

5. Increase public awareness: Conduct nationwide campaigns to educate voters on the importance of transparent financing and how to access information.

6. Implement independent audits: Require regular financial audits of political parties and candidates by independent accounting firms.

7. Create whistleblower protections: Safeguard individuals who report campaign finance irregularities from retaliation.

8. Establish an election watchdog: Set up a dedicated agency focused solely on monitoring campaign finance practices.

9. Promote alternative funding models: Explore public financing systems that reduce reliance on private donors.

The challenges in achieving transparency are significant. Corruption remains entrenched in some political circles, and powerful interests often resist efforts to shed light on their activities. However, the benefits of increased transparency far outweigh these obstacles.

Transparent campaign finance practices would help prevent vote-buying schemes, reduce corruption, and ensure that elected officials truly represent their constituents rather than special interests. It would also boost public trust in government and political institutions.

While progress has been made in recent years, much work remains. The Philippines can learn from international best practices, such as those implemented in countries like Germany and Australia, where robust campaign finance regulations have helped maintain electoral integrity [1].

Implementing these reforms will require sustained effort and commitment from policymakers. It's crucial that all sectors of society - civil society organizations, media, and citizens themselves - push for greater transparency.

As we move forward, let us remember that true democracy requires more than just casting ballots every few years. It demands informed participation, free from undue influence by hidden money. By shining light on dark campaign finances, we can build a more equitable, responsive, and accountable system of governance for all Filipinos.",1
28,Phind Instant,"Mental health stigma remains a pervasive issue in the Philippines, hindering efforts to promote wellness and provide support to those struggling with mental illness. This editorial examines the current state of mental health stigma in the country and proposes ways to address it.

Recent studies have highlighted the extent of mental health stigma in the Philippines:

1. A 2020 survey found that 63% of Filipinos believed mental illness was caused by personal weakness rather than treatable medical conditions [1].

2. Many Filipinos view mental illness as a family problem rather than an individual health issue, discouraging open discussion and seeking help [1].

3. Stigma can lead to social isolation, reduced opportunities, and increased financial burdens for those struggling with mental health issues [1].

The consequences of stigma are severe:

- Many Filipinos avoid seeking treatment due to fear of discrimination or shame.
- Mental health professionals often face prejudice from colleagues and community members.
- Media portrayals frequently rely on negative stereotypes, perpetuating harmful misconceptions.

To combat this entrenched stigma, several strategies are crucial:

1. Education and awareness campaigns: Implement nationwide initiatives to educate Filipinos about mental health facts and dispel common myths.

2. Media responsibility: Encourage accurate, nuanced portrayals of mental illness in media to counteract negative stereotypes.

3. Community-based support: Foster networks of understanding and support within local communities.

4. Professional training: Provide mental health professionals with stigma reduction training to better serve clients.

5. Policy reforms: Strengthen laws protecting the rights of people with mental illnesses and their families.

6. Normalize discussions: Encourage open conversations about mental health in workplaces, schools, and social circles.

7. Support peer programs: Promote self-help groups and peer support systems to empower those living with mental illness.

8. Address cultural factors: Recognize how cultural beliefs about fate and family honor contribute to stigma and develop culturally sensitive interventions.

9. Improve healthcare access: Expand mental health services and make treatment more accessible and affordable.

10. Engage influencers: Partner with social media personalities and thought leaders to amplify mental health messages.

Breaking down mental health stigma requires sustained effort from all sectors of society. By working together, we can create a Philippines where those struggling with mental illness feel supported rather than stigmatized. It's time to shatter the silence surrounding mental health and build a more compassionate society for all Filipinos.",1
29,Phind Instant,"The Philippines is facing a critical urban crisis characterized by severe congestion and housing shortages in its major cities. This editorial examines these pressing issues and proposes solutions to address them.

Metropolitan Manila, one of the world's most densely populated urban areas, exemplifies the challenges:

1. Overcrowding: With 14.5 million people packed into an area smaller than New York City, Manila faces severe traffic congestion [2].

2. Limited green spaces: The city averages only 43 feet above sea level, making it vulnerable to flooding and lacking ample areas for recreation [2].

3. Economic segregation: Wealthy enclaves exist alongside informal settlements with inadequate basic services [2].

The government's response has been the development of New Clark City, a planned metropolis designed to alleviate these challenges:

1. Location: Situated on higher ground between two mountain ranges, New Clark City aims to provide protection against extreme weather events [2].

2. Green spaces: The city incorporates ample parks and green areas [2].

3. Mass transit: Designed with public transportation from the outset to prevent future congestion [2].

4. Mixed-use development: Aims to avoid economic segregation by incorporating commercial, residential, and industrial areas [2].

However, critics raise several concerns:

1. Land acquisition issues: The project has faced criticism over land taken without consent from Indigenous communities [2].

2. Affordability: There are worries that New Clark City may become a haven for elites rather than providing housing for all income levels [2].

3. Relocation challenges: Moving 14.5 million people from Manila to a new city poses significant logistical hurdles.

4. Climate change resilience: While designed with climate resilience in mind, no location can guarantee complete immunity from extreme weather events [2].

To address these challenges comprehensively, several strategies should be pursued:

1. Balanced urban development: Implement policies that encourage sustainable growth in existing cities while developing new ones like New Clark City.

2. Affordable housing initiatives: Prioritize programs to increase housing availability across income brackets.

3. Public transportation improvements: Invest heavily in efficient, reliable mass transit systems in urban areas.

4. Green infrastructure: Incorporate more parks, green roofs, and urban forestry initiatives to mitigate flooding risks.

5. Climate-resilient design: Ensure all new construction incorporates climate change adaptation measures.

6. Community engagement: Involve local communities in planning processes to address concerns and ensure equitable development.

7. Economic diversification: Foster industries beyond traditional sectors to reduce reliance on a single economic driver.

8. Education and skills training: Provide opportunities for workers to adapt to changing job markets.

9. Addressing informal settlements: Develop comprehensive plans to upgrade informal settlements while providing alternatives for those who choose to move.

10. International collaboration: Learn from successful urban development models worldwide and adapt them to Philippine contexts.

The path forward requires a multi-faceted approach that balances economic growth with social equity and environmental sustainability. By working together, we can create cities that thrive without sacrificing quality of life or exacerbating existing inequalities.

As we shape the future of urban development in the Philippines, let us prioritize the needs of all Filipinos - from those living in informal settlements to those seeking opportunities in new metropolises. The challenge before us is significant, but with vision, planning, and collective effort, we can build cities that truly work for everyone.",1
30,Phind Instant,"The Philippines, known for its stunning beaches and rich marine biodiversity, finds itself at the forefront of a devastating environmental crisis: plastic pollution in its oceans. The country's waters have become a dumping ground for plastic waste, with alarming consequences for its ecosystems and economy. This editorial explores the scale of the problem and proposes solutions to address it.

Recent data paints a stark picture:

1. The Philippines was responsible for 36.38% of global oceanic plastic waste in 2019, surpassing India as the world's largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution [1].

2. Seven of the top ten plastic-polluted rivers in the world are located in the Philippines, with the Pasig River now considered the most polluted river globally [1].

3. Nearly half of all rabbitfish, a common food species, were found to contain traces of microplastics in Philippine waters [1].

The consequences of this pollution are far-reaching:

1. Marine ecosystems: Coral reefs, crucial for marine biodiversity, face increased disease risk when exposed to plastic debris. Without plastic, coral reefs have only a 4% likelihood of contracting diseases; with plastic, this risk jumps to 89% [1].

2. Human health: Microplastics entering our food chain pose potential risks to human health, though their full impact remains unclear [1].

3. Economic impacts: The tourism industry, a significant contributor to the Philippines' economy, faces threats from polluted beaches and waters.

The root causes of this crisis are multifaceted:

1. Cultural factors: The country's ""sachet economy"" encourages consumption of small, single-use plastics [1].

2. Poverty: With millions living below the poverty line, affordable alternatives to proper waste disposal are often sought [1].

3. Lack of infrastructure: Only 30% of Filipinos have access to proper waste disposal facilities [1].

4. Government oversight: Despite having laws regulating waste disposal, enforcement has been lacking [1].

To address this crisis, several strategies must be implemented:

1. Extended Producer Responsibility: Hold manufacturers accountable for the waste generated by their products through take-back programs and recycling initiatives.

2. Improved waste management infrastructure: Invest in developing a comprehensive network of waste collection and recycling facilities.

3. Education and awareness campaigns: Launch nationwide initiatives to educate citizens about the dangers of plastic pollution and promote sustainable practices.

4. Circular economy policies: Encourage businesses to adopt circular economy models that reduce packaging and increase recyclability.

5. International cooperation: Collaborate with neighboring countries to address regional pollution issues.

6. Strengthen enforcement of waste laws: Ensure proper implementation and punishment for those who violate waste management regulations.

7. Support local recycling industries: Promote and develop domestic recycling capabilities to reduce reliance on imports.

8. Eco-friendly alternatives: Encourage the development and adoption of biodegradable materials and compostable packaging.

9. Community-based initiatives: Empower local communities to take ownership of clean-up efforts and promote sustainable practices.

10. Research and monitoring: Conduct regular studies to track plastic pollution levels and assess the effectiveness of interventions.

The path forward requires collective action from government, businesses, civil society, and individuals. By working together, we can stem the tide of plastic pollution and protect the Philippines' precious marine resources for future generations.

Let us recognize the severity of this crisis and commit to meaningful change. Our oceans, our economy, and our very way of life depend on it. The fight against plastic pollution must become a national priority, with immediate and sustained effort to address this pressing environmental challenge.",1
31,GPT4o-mini,"For decades, the concept of federalism has been a recurring theme in the political discourse of the Philippines. Advocates argue that it holds the key to balanced regional development and empowerment, while critics warn of potential economic disparities and governance complications. As the debate continues, it is crucial to analyze the benefits, challenges, and the viability of federalism in the context of the Philippines.

Understanding Federalism

Federalism is a system of government that divides power between a central authority and regional governments. Unlike the current unitary system in the Philippines, where authority is highly centralized in Manila, federalism proposes the establishment of autonomous regions with the power to legislate, implement policies, and manage resources according to their local needs.

Countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany have successfully implemented federal systems, allowing regions to address their unique challenges while maintaining national unity. However, for the Philippines, a nation of over 7,000 islands with diverse cultural, linguistic, and economic landscapes, the transition to federalism presents both opportunities and hurdles.

The Case for Federalism

1. Regional Empowerment and Development

Proponents argue that federalism can lead to more equitable development by allowing regions to harness their own resources and craft policies tailored to their specific needs. Under the current centralized system, resource-rich but geographically distant regions, such as Mindanao, often receive disproportionately less funding and attention compared to Metro Manila. Federalism could bridge these gaps by giving regional governments control over revenue generation and expenditure.

2. Decentralization of Power

Federalism offers an opportunity to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption by limiting the concentration of power in the national government. Local leaders, being more attuned to their constituents' needs, could implement policies more effectively without excessive bureaucratic red tape.

3. Preservation of Cultural Identity

With the Philippines' rich tapestry of cultures and languages, federalism could provide a framework for greater cultural expression and preservation. Regions with distinct identities, such as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), could benefit from greater autonomy to promote their own cultural and religious practices.

4. Economic Competitiveness

A federal system may encourage healthy competition among regions, fostering economic growth and innovation. With greater autonomy, regions could attract investments by offering incentives tailored to their local economies, further diversifying the country's economic base.

Challenges of Federalism in the Philippines

1. Economic Disparities

A major concern regarding federalism is the uneven distribution of wealth among regions. Some provinces, particularly in Luzon, have thriving economies, while others, such as those in Eastern Visayas or Mindanao, struggle with poverty and underdevelopment. Critics argue that federalism could exacerbate these inequalities, with wealthier regions advancing while poorer ones fall further behind.

2. Political Dynasties and Corruption

The Philippines has long struggled with entrenched political dynasties and corruption. Critics fear that federalism could empower local elites even further, allowing them to consolidate power and resources within their regions without adequate checks and balances from the central government.

3. Implementation Costs

Transitioning to a federal system would require a complete overhaul of the current government structure, including the creation of new regional administrations, legal frameworks, and resource allocation mechanisms. This shift could be costly and time-consuming, potentially diverting funds away from crucial services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

4. National Unity Concerns

There are fears that federalism could lead to regionalism and fragmentation, weakening national unity. The prospect of autonomous regions crafting their own policies and regulations may create inconsistencies in governance and economic strategy, potentially causing tensions between regions and the central government.

Proposed Federalism Models for the Philippines

Several models have been proposed for the Philippines' shift to federalism, with the most prominent being:

The Duterte Administration's Proposed Federal Charter: This model aimed to establish 18 federated regions with a strong federal government overseeing national concerns such as defense, foreign affairs, and monetary policy.

The Bayanihan Federalism Model: Advocated by the Consultative Committee under President Duterte, this model emphasized inclusivity and social justice, with a focus on equitable resource distribution.

The Pimentel Model: Proposed by former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr., this plan divides the country into 11 federal states based on cultural and economic considerations, granting significant autonomy to each region.

Is Federalism the Right Path for the Philippines?

The answer to whether federalism is suitable for the Philippines is not a simple one. While the system promises greater regional autonomy, decentralization, and cultural preservation, it also presents risks such as increased disparities, political entrenchment, and governance inefficiencies.

The success of federalism would largely depend on meticulous planning, proper execution, and a strong legal framework to ensure accountability, transparency, and fair resource distribution. Strengthening local governance, investing in infrastructure, and addressing corruption must be prioritized to ensure a smooth transition.

Ultimately, the debate over federalism should go beyond political rhetoric and be grounded in comprehensive studies, public consultations, and a clear roadmap that considers the country's socio-political landscape. Whether through constitutional reform or incremental decentralization, the goal should be a governance model that best serves the Filipino people.

Conclusion

Federalism presents a bold vision for the Philippines—one that could empower regions, foster economic growth, and promote cultural diversity. However, without the necessary safeguards, it could also deepen existing divisions and economic inequalities. As the nation grapples with this crucial decision, it is imperative to weigh the potential benefits against the risks and determine whether federalism truly offers a path to a more prosperous and united Philippines.",1
32,GPT4o-mini,"In the Philippines, the integrity of electoral processes is paramount to sustaining a robust democracy. A critical component of this integrity is the transparency of election campaign finances, which ensures that candidates and political parties operate within legal frameworks and maintain public trust. Over the years, the Philippines has established laws and regulations aimed at promoting financial transparency during elections. However, challenges persist, necessitating continuous evaluation and reform.

Legal Framework Governing Campaign Finance

The Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881) serves as the primary legislation governing electoral processes, including campaign finance. Sections 106 to 109 of the Code mandate that every candidate and treasurer of a political party maintain detailed records of all contributions received and expenditures incurred. These records must include the amount and date of each contribution, the full name and address of contributors, and detailed accounts of expenditures. Furthermore, candidates and party treasurers are required to preserve these records for at least three years after the election and produce them for inspection upon request by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) or its authorized representatives. 
ELIBRARY

To prevent undue influence and maintain the integrity of the electoral process, the law prohibits certain entities from making contributions for partisan political activities. These entities include public or private financial institutions, natural and juridical persons operating public utilities or exploiting natural resources, those holding contracts with the government, and foreign nationals or corporations. Additionally, officials and employees in the civil service and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines are barred from making such contributions.

COMELEC's Initiatives to Enhance Transparency

In its ongoing efforts to combat vote-buying and ensure fair elections, COMELEC has implemented measures such as the ""money ban."" This policy prohibits individuals from carrying, possessing, or transporting cash amounts of ₱500,000 or more during specific periods surrounding elections. The ban aims to deter vote-buying by limiting the circulation of large sums of money that could be used to influence voters. Exceptions are made for authorized persons, such as businesspersons and disbursement officials, who can demonstrate legitimate reasons for carrying substantial amounts of cash. 
PHILIPPINE INFORMATION AGENCY

Challenges in Enforcing Financial Transparency

Despite the established legal framework and COMELEC's initiatives, challenges in enforcing campaign finance transparency persist. Instances of non-compliance with reporting requirements, underreporting of contributions and expenditures, and the use of illicit funds continue to undermine the integrity of elections. The case of Alice Guo, the former mayor of Bamban, Tarlac province, illustrates the complexities involved. Guo faced allegations of involvement in financial scams and other illicit activities, raising concerns about the potential for illegal funds to infiltrate political campaigns and the adequacy of existing oversight mechanisms. 
THE GUARDIAN

Recommendations for Strengthening Campaign Finance Transparency

To address these challenges and bolster the transparency of election campaign finances in the Philippines, several measures can be considered:

Enhancing Monitoring and Enforcement: Strengthening the capacity of COMELEC to monitor campaign finances and enforce regulations is crucial. This includes investing in technology to track contributions and expenditures in real-time and increasing the number of personnel dedicated to oversight functions.

Promoting Public Access to Information: Ensuring that campaign finance records are easily accessible to the public can enhance transparency and accountability. Publishing these records online in a user-friendly format would allow citizens and civil society organizations to scrutinize campaign finances effectively.

Implementing Stricter Penalties for Non-Compliance: Imposing more stringent penalties for candidates and parties that fail to comply with reporting requirements or engage in illicit financial activities can serve as a deterrent. This could include substantial fines, disqualification from running for office, or criminal charges in severe cases.

Encouraging Civic Engagement and Oversight: Empowering civil society organizations and the media to play a more active role in monitoring campaign finances can complement official efforts. Training and resources can be provided to these groups to enhance their capacity to detect and report irregularities.

Regularly Updating Legal Frameworks: Continuously reviewing and updating the legal frameworks governing campaign finance to address emerging challenges and close loopholes is essential. This includes adapting to new forms of fundraising and expenditure, such as digital campaigns and crowdfunding.

Conclusion

Financial transparency in election campaigns is fundamental to the health of the Philippines' democracy. While existing laws and regulations provide a solid foundation, ongoing challenges necessitate continuous efforts to strengthen enforcement, enhance public access to information, and promote accountability. By implementing these measures, the Philippines can work towards more transparent and fair elections, thereby reinforcing public trust in the democratic process.",1
33,GPT4o-mini,"Mental health remains a critical yet often overlooked issue in the Philippines. Despite the passing of the Mental Health Act in 2018, which aimed to integrate mental health services into the country's public health system, deep-rooted stigma continues to hinder progress. Societal perceptions, cultural beliefs, and economic barriers all contribute to the difficulty of addressing mental health concerns openly. As the nation grapples with increasing cases of depression, anxiety, and suicide, it becomes imperative to challenge the stigma and create a more supportive environment for those struggling with their mental well-being.

The Cultural Stigma Surrounding Mental Health

In Filipino culture, mental health issues are frequently misunderstood and, in many cases, dismissed entirely. Traditional values that emphasize resilience, family reputation, and religious faith often discourage individuals from seeking professional help. The concept of ""hiya"" (shame) plays a significant role in perpetuating silence, as individuals fear being perceived as weak or burdening their families with their struggles.

Additionally, there remains a prevailing belief that mental health problems are simply a result of a lack of faith or personal weakness. Phrases such as ""Dasal lang yan"" (Just pray) or ""Kaya mo yan"" (You can do it) reflect the cultural inclination to downplay psychological struggles and promote a ""grin and bear it"" mentality. While faith and perseverance are valuable coping mechanisms, they should not replace professional intervention when necessary.

The Role of Media and Misinformation

Media representation in the Philippines has also contributed to the stigma surrounding mental health. Television shows and films often portray individuals with mental illnesses as violent, unstable, or comical, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. These portrayals contribute to public fear and misunderstanding, discouraging those who need help from stepping forward.

Social media, while a potential tool for awareness, can also spread misinformation about mental health. Misinformed advice, self-diagnosis, and stigmatizing language can further alienate those seeking help and reinforce misconceptions within the community.

Barriers to Mental Health Care

Even for those who recognize the importance of mental health, access to professional help remains a significant challenge. In many rural areas, mental health services are either nonexistent or severely lacking, forcing individuals to travel long distances to seek care. The cost of therapy and psychiatric medications can be prohibitive for lower-income families, making mental health care a privilege rather than a right.

Additionally, there is a shortage of trained mental health professionals in the Philippines. According to the Department of Health, there is a stark disparity between the number of individuals requiring mental health services and the available professionals to meet those needs. This shortage leads to long waiting times, inadequate treatment, and further discouragement from seeking help.

Steps Toward Breaking the Stigma

Addressing the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach involving government intervention, community support, and educational initiatives.

1. Government Initiatives and Policy Implementation

While the passage of the Mental Health Act was a significant step forward, full implementation and funding remain crucial. The government must ensure that mental health services are integrated into primary health care centers nationwide, making them accessible to all Filipinos. Training for healthcare providers in mental health awareness and treatment should be prioritized to equip them with the necessary skills to identify and address mental health issues effectively.

2. Public Awareness Campaigns

Awareness campaigns can play a vital role in normalizing conversations about mental health. Social media influencers, celebrities, and local leaders can use their platforms to educate the public and share personal experiences, helping to break down stereotypes and encourage open discussions. National campaigns such as ""#UsapTayo"" (Let's Talk) have already made strides in this area, but more efforts are needed to reach all communities.

3. Incorporating Mental Health Education

Educational institutions should integrate mental health awareness into their curriculum. Teaching students about mental well-being, coping mechanisms, and the importance of seeking help can foster a culture of acceptance and empathy from an early age. Guidance counselors should also receive specialized training to support students facing mental health challenges.

4. Community-Based Support Systems

Grassroots initiatives, such as mental health support groups and peer counseling programs, can provide accessible and relatable support for those in need. Barangay health workers and community leaders should be trained to recognize signs of mental distress and offer initial support or referrals to appropriate services.

5. Encouraging Workplace Mental Health Programs

Employers should be encouraged to implement mental health policies in the workplace. Providing mental health days, offering employee assistance programs, and fostering a supportive work environment can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being.

Moving Forward

Breaking the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires collective effort and a shift in cultural attitudes. By fostering open conversations, increasing access to mental health services, and challenging harmful stereotypes, the country can create a more compassionate and understanding society. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and acknowledging this reality is the first step toward meaningful change.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a Philippines where individuals feel empowered to seek help without fear of judgment, where mental well-being is prioritized, and where no one has to suffer in silence.",1
34,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines, with its rapidly growing urban centers, faces significant challenges in urban congestion and housing shortages. These issues not only hinder economic progress but also impact the quality of life for millions of Filipinos.

The Urbanization Surge

In recent decades, the Philippines has experienced a notable shift from rural to urban living. Cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have become magnets for individuals seeking better employment opportunities and access to services. However, this rapid urbanization has led to overcrowded cities, strained infrastructure, and a burgeoning demand for housing.

The Traffic Conundrum

Metro Manila, the nation's capital region, epitomizes the challenges of urban congestion. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimates that the Philippines loses approximately Php 3.5 billion daily due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila, amounting to Php 1.27 trillion annually. This congestion not only results in lost productivity but also contributes to environmental degradation and increased stress among commuters.

Housing Shortfalls

The surge in urban migration has outpaced the development of affordable housing. The Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) estimates that there are about 1.4 million informal settler families nationwide, with 40% residing in Metro Manila. The total housing units needed this year are projected to reach 6.3 million, with private sector estimates suggesting that the required housing units could reach 12.5 million by 2030. This shortage has led to the proliferation of informal settlements, where residents often lack access to basic services and are vulnerable to environmental hazards.

Government Initiatives

Recognizing the gravity of the housing crisis, the government launched the Pambansang Pabahay Para sa Pilipino Program (4PH) in September 2022. The program aims to build 1 million housing units annually to address the backlog of 6.5 million units. As of April 2023, approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million housing sites have been initiated under this program. Additionally, in July 2023, President Bongbong Marcos issued Executive Order No. 34, directing all National Government Agencies and Instrumentalities, including Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), as well as Local Government Units (LGUs), to submit a detailed inventory of suitable lands for housing to support the program's implementation.

Innovative Urban Planning: The 15-Minute City

To combat urban congestion, some developers are embracing the concept of the ""15-Minute City."" This urban planning model envisions that all essential services—workplaces, schools, healthcare, and recreational facilities—are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from residents' homes. In Metro Manila, developments like MyTown, a network of dormitories near major business districts, exemplify this approach. Residents benefit from reduced commute times, leading to improved productivity and well-being.

The Way Forward

Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multifaceted approach:

Infrastructure Development: Investing in efficient public transportation systems can alleviate traffic congestion and reduce the reliance on private vehicles.

Affordable Housing: Accelerating the construction of affordable housing units and ensuring their strategic location can help accommodate the growing urban population.

Urban Decentralization: Encouraging the development of secondary cities can distribute economic activities more evenly and reduce the pressure on major urban centers.

Sustainable Urban Planning: Implementing concepts like the 15-Minute City can enhance the quality of urban life and promote environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, while the challenges of urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines are significant, strategic planning, robust government initiatives, and innovative urban development models offer a pathway to more livable and sustainable cities for future generations.",1
35,GPT4o-mini,"Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges facing the Philippines today. As an archipelago with over 7,600 islands, the country is uniquely vulnerable to the devastating effects of plastic waste, which threatens marine ecosystems, public health, and economic stability. Despite numerous initiatives and policies aimed at addressing the issue, plastic pollution continues to escalate, demanding urgent and collective action.

The Scope of the Problem

The Philippines is among the world's top contributors to plastic waste, with studies indicating that the country generates approximately 2.7 million tons of plastic waste annually. Alarmingly, around 20% of this plastic ends up in the ocean. The nation's reliance on single-use plastics, such as sachets and plastic bags, exacerbates the crisis. These products are deeply embedded in Filipino culture and consumer habits due to their affordability and convenience, but they come at an immense environmental cost.

One of the key contributors to the plastic waste problem is the lack of efficient waste management infrastructure. In many areas, particularly in urban centers and coastal communities, improper disposal practices, such as open dumping and burning, are prevalent. The absence of proper recycling facilities and segregation practices further complicates efforts to mitigate the crisis.

Impact on Marine Ecosystems

As an island nation, the Philippines boasts rich marine biodiversity, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves that serve as habitats for countless species. However, plastic pollution poses a severe threat to these ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement, which can result in injury or death. Microplastics, tiny plastic particles that originate from larger debris breaking down, have also infiltrated the food chain, posing potential health risks to humans.

Additionally, plastic waste contributes to the destruction of coral reefs, a vital source of livelihood for millions of Filipinos who depend on fishing and tourism. Coral reefs suffocated by plastic debris experience reduced growth rates and increased susceptibility to disease, further threatening the country's food security and economic sustainability.

Public Health Concerns

Beyond environmental impacts, plastic pollution has significant implications for public health in the Philippines. Poorly managed plastic waste often clogs drainage systems, leading to widespread flooding during the rainy season. Floodwaters can become breeding grounds for diseases such as dengue fever and leptospirosis, posing severe health risks to communities.

Moreover, the burning of plastic waste, a common practice in many rural and urban areas, releases toxic chemicals into the air. These pollutants, including dioxins and furans, are known to cause respiratory diseases, hormonal imbalances, and even cancer.

Government Initiatives and Challenges

In response to the growing crisis, the Philippine government has introduced various policies and programs aimed at reducing plastic pollution. The Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (Republic Act 9003) was a landmark legislation designed to promote waste reduction, recycling, and proper disposal. However, implementation at the local level has been inconsistent, hindered by a lack of funding, enforcement, and public awareness.

More recently, several local governments have enacted ordinances banning single-use plastics, such as plastic straws and bags. While these efforts are commendable, they often face resistance from businesses and consumers who rely on these products for their daily needs.

Corporate Responsibility and Consumer Action

The private sector plays a crucial role in combating plastic pollution in the Philippines. Major corporations, particularly those in the food and beverage industry, are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable packaging alternatives and reduce their plastic footprint. Some companies have responded by implementing take-back programs, promoting reusable packaging, and investing in biodegradable alternatives.

Consumers, too, have a role to play in addressing the crisis. Small changes in daily habits, such as using reusable bags, bottles, and containers, can collectively make a significant impact. Public education and awareness campaigns are essential in encouraging behavioral changes and fostering a culture of environmental responsibility.

Innovative Solutions and the Path Forward

While the plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines is daunting, there are innovative solutions that offer hope. Community-based recycling initiatives, such as ""eco-bricks"" made from compressed plastic waste, provide creative ways to repurpose plastics and reduce landfill contributions. Additionally, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and advocacy groups have been instrumental in spearheading beach clean-ups, policy advocacy, and awareness campaigns.

Technology and scientific research can also play a role in addressing the crisis. Emerging solutions, such as biodegradable plastics derived from natural materials and plastic-eating bacteria, hold promise in reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste.

Conclusion: A Call to Collective Action

The plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach that involves government action, corporate responsibility, and public participation. Strengthening waste management systems, enforcing existing regulations, and fostering innovation are essential steps toward a cleaner and more sustainable future.

Every Filipino has a role to play in combating plastic pollution, whether through responsible consumption, advocacy, or community involvement. By working together, the Philippines can protect its precious natural resources and ensure a healthier, more sustainable environment for future generations.",1
36,Llama3.2,"The concept of federalism has been debated in the Philippines for decades, with some arguing that it is the only way to address the country's deep-seated regional and socio-economic disparities. The idea of a more decentralized system of government, where power is divided between a central authority and regional governments, has gained significant traction in recent years.

The current Philippine government, led by President Rodrigo Duterte, has been exploring options for federalism as a way to address the country's long-standing issues with regional autonomy and representation. The proposal aims to create a more inclusive and equitable system of governance that recognizes the diversity of regional cultures, languages, and interests.

One of the primary arguments in favor of federalism is its ability to address regional disparities. Under the current system, regional development is largely controlled by the central government, with limited autonomy for local governments to make decisions about their own affairs. Federalism, on the other hand, would grant more power to regional governments, allowing them to make decisions that are tailored to their specific needs and circumstances.

Another key benefit of federalism is its ability to promote greater representation and participation in governance. Under a federal system, regional governments would have a stronger presence in national politics, ensuring that local voices are heard and represented at the highest levels of government. This would be particularly beneficial for marginalized communities, who often feel left behind by central government policies.

However, there are also concerns about the potential drawbacks of federalism. Some argue that it could lead to greater fragmentation and instability, as regional governments may have competing interests and priorities. Others worry that a more decentralized system of government could create bureaucratic inefficiencies and duplication of efforts.

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that the benefits of federalism outweigh its costs. For example, a study by the University of the Philippines found that a federal system would lead to greater regional growth and development, as well as increased investment in public goods and services.

Another key proponent of federalism is Senator Manny Pacquiao, who has been a strong advocate for the concept throughout his career. Pacquiao argues that a federal system would allow the country to better address its deep-seated socio-economic disparities, and to create more opportunities for economic growth and development.

However, not all Filipinos are convinced of the benefits of federalism. Some argue that it could lead to greater regionalism and fragmentation, undermining the country's national unity and cohesion. Others worry about the potential costs of implementing a new system of government, particularly in terms of infrastructure and institutional capacity.

In conclusion, federalism is an idea whose time has come in the Philippines. The current system of governance has failed many Filipinos, particularly those living outside of Manila, who feel left behind by central government policies. A more decentralized system of government would allow for greater regional autonomy, representation, and participation, addressing the country's deep-seated socio-economic disparities.

While there are certainly challenges to implementing federalism, many experts believe that its benefits outweigh its costs. The future of Philippine governance is at a crossroads, and it is time for the country to consider a new era of governance that reflects the needs and aspirations of all Filipinos.",1
37,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is set to hold another historic presidential election, one that promises to be a defining moment for the country's democracy. However, amidst all the hype and excitement, a more pressing concern looms over the campaign trail - the lack of transparency in election campaign financing.

For decades, the Philippines has been plagued by a culture of corruption and cronyism in politics. The country's elections have long been marred by allegations of vote-rigging, bribery, and other forms of electoral malfeasance. One of the major contributing factors to this problem is the lack of transparency in election campaign financing.

Under current laws, politicians are allowed to raise funds from a variety of sources, including donations from individuals, corporations, and special interest groups. However, these campaigns often operate in the shadows, with little disclosure about their funding sources or expenditures.

This lack of transparency creates an environment that fosters corruption and cronyism. Politicians may feel pressure to accept donations from certain groups or individuals in order to secure support for their campaign, even if those donations come with strings attached. This can lead to a situation where politicians are beholden to powerful interests rather than the people they represent.

Furthermore, the lack of transparency in election campaign financing makes it difficult to hold politicians accountable for their actions. Without clear disclosure about who is funding their campaigns and how that money is being spent, voters have no way of knowing whether they are voting for a candidate who truly represents their interests or one who is beholden to special interests.

To address this problem, the Philippines needs to implement more robust campaign finance regulations. This could include requirements for candidates to disclose their donors and expenditures in real-time, as well as limits on the amount of money that can be raised and spent by each candidate.

Another important step would be to establish an independent agency responsible for enforcing these regulations. This agency should have the power to investigate allegations of corruption and malfeasance, and to take action against candidates who fail to comply with campaign finance laws.

The benefits of stronger campaign finance regulations in the Philippines would be numerous. For one, they would help to increase transparency and accountability in politics. By requiring candidates to disclose their donors and expenditures, voters would have a better understanding of who is backing each candidate's campaign and what policies they are advocating for.

Additionally, stronger campaign finance regulations could help to reduce corruption and cronyism in politics. By limiting the amount of money that can be raised and spent by each candidate, politicians would be less tempted to accept donations from special interest groups or individuals with hidden agendas.

Finally, stronger campaign finance regulations could help to level the playing field for smaller candidates and independent organizations. Under current laws, larger campaigns often have a significant advantage when it comes to fundraising, which can make it difficult for smaller candidates to compete.

In conclusion, election campaign financial transparency is a critical issue in the Philippines. The lack of transparency in campaign financing creates an environment that fosters corruption and cronyism, making it difficult for voters to hold politicians accountable for their actions.

To address this problem, the Philippines needs to implement stronger campaign finance regulations, including requirements for disclosure and limits on fundraising. By taking these steps, the country can increase transparency and accountability in politics, reduce corruption and cronyism, and ensure that every vote counts.",1
38,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is a country plagued by numerous social and economic challenges, but one issue that continues to affect millions of Filipinos remains shrouded in secrecy and stigma - mental health. Despite being a major public health concern, mental illness is often stigmatized and misunderstood, leading to a lack of access to treatment and support for those who need it most.

The stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines can be attributed to various factors, including cultural and social norms, lack of education and awareness, and historical experiences of colonialism and foreign influence. In many Filipino households, mental illness is seen as a personal failing or a sign of weakness, rather than a legitimate medical condition that requires treatment and support.

This stigma is particularly damaging for individuals who are already vulnerable due to factors such as poverty, lack of education, and limited access to healthcare. Those struggling with mental health issues may be reluctant to seek help due to fear of being labeled as ""crazy"" or ""weak"", leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

The consequences of this stigma are far-reaching. Mental illness is a major contributor to disability and mortality worldwide, and the Philippines is no exception. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health disorders affect an estimated 12% of the Philippine population, with depression being the most common condition.

Furthermore, the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines can have a negative impact on the economy and society as a whole. A study by the Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) found that mental health issues can lead to reduced productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism (being physically present but not fully productive), resulting in significant economic losses.

To break down this stigma, it is essential to increase awareness and understanding of mental health among Filipinos. This can be achieved through various means, including education and training programs for healthcare professionals, community outreach and support services, and advocacy campaigns to raise awareness about mental health issues.

One notable example of a successful initiative to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines is the #BreakTheStigma campaign launched by the Philippine Psychiatric Association (PPA). The campaign aims to promote mental health awareness and education through social media, public events, and partnerships with schools, workplaces, and community organizations.

Another critical step towards reducing the stigma is to ensure that mental health services are accessible and affordable for all Filipinos. This can be achieved by increasing funding for mental health programs, expanding access to healthcare facilities, and promoting the use of telepsychiatry and other innovative technologies.

In addition, policymakers must take a proactive role in addressing the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines. The government has a responsibility to ensure that mental health services are included in the National Health Act, and that policies and programs are implemented to promote mental health awareness and education.

The journey towards greater awareness and understanding of mental health in the Philippines will not be easy. It requires a sustained effort from individuals, organizations, and governments to break down the stigma and promote a culture of inclusivity and support.

However, the benefits of this journey are well worth the effort. By reducing the stigma surrounding mental health, we can create a society where individuals feel comfortable seeking help when they need it most, and where mental illness is seen as a treatable medical condition rather than a personal failing.

In conclusion, breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, awareness, advocacy, and access to treatment. By working together, we can create a society where mental health is prioritized and supported, and where all Filipinos have access to the care and support they need to thrive.",1
39,Llama3.2,"As the Philippines continues to grow and develop, two of its most pressing challenges are urban congestion and housing shortages. The country's rapid urbanization has led to a surge in population growth, resulting in overcrowding and congestion in cities like Manila, Cebu, and Davao.

Urban congestion is a major issue in the Philippines, with commuters spending hours stuck in traffic every day. This not only affects productivity but also leads to increased air pollution, noise pollution, and stress levels. In fact, according to a study by the University of the Philippines, urban congestion costs the country's economy approximately P1.3 trillion (approximately USD 25 billion) annually.

The housing shortage is another pressing issue in the Philippines. With limited land supply and increasing demand for housing, prices have skyrocketed, making it difficult for low- and middle-income families to afford a decent place to live. According to data from the National Homeowners Association of the Philippines (NHA), there are over 2 million households living in informal settlements, with many more waiting lists for government-assisted housing programs.

The combination of urban congestion and housing shortages has far-reaching consequences for individuals, communities, and the economy as a whole. For instance, research by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) found that congested cities like Manila lead to increased health risks due to air pollution, heat stress, and reduced access to healthcare services.

Moreover, the lack of affordable housing options exacerbates social inequality in the Philippines. Families are forced to spend a significant portion of their income on rent or mortgage payments, leaving them with limited resources for other essential expenses like food, education, and healthcare. This perpetuates cycles of poverty and limits opportunities for economic mobility.

To address these pressing issues, policymakers must adopt a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes sustainable urban planning, affordable housing, and public transportation development. One effective strategy is to implement smart growth policies that encourage mixed-use development, denser settlements, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.

For example, the city of Makati's ""Smart Growth Plan"" promotes mixed-use development and efficient land use to reduce congestion and increase housing affordability. Similarly, the municipality of Taguig has implemented a ""Pedestrian-Friendly Infrastructure Plan"" that prioritizes walking and cycling infrastructure over car-centric designs.

Another critical step is to improve public transportation options in urban areas. The Philippines can learn from successful models like Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system or Hong Kong's Octopus card, which provide efficient, affordable, and reliable transportation services for commuters.

The government also plays a crucial role in addressing these issues. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHUD) should prioritize affordable housing programs that provide financing options for low- and middle-income families. Moreover, the Land Use Regulatory Board (LUB) should be empowered to enforce zoning regulations and ensure that new developments are designed with sustainability and community needs in mind.

The private sector also has a vital role to play in addressing urban congestion and housing shortages. Developers can prioritize affordable housing options, while transportation companies can invest in efficient public transportation systems. Businesses can also adopt flexible work arrangements that promote telecommuting or flexible schedules to reduce the need for lengthy commutes.

In conclusion, the Philippines' urban congestion and housing shortages are pressing issues that require a comprehensive response. By prioritizing sustainable urban planning, affordable housing, and public transportation development, we can create more livable cities where all Filipinos can thrive.",1
40,Llama3.2,"The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, has long been known for its rich marine biodiversity and pristine beaches. However, in recent years, the country's beauty and natural resources have come under threat from a growing menace: plastic pollution.

Every day, millions of tons of plastic waste are generated in the Philippines, with much of it ending up in our oceans, rivers, and landscapes. The effects of plastic pollution on the environment, human health, and the economy are far-reaching and devastating.

One of the most alarming statistics is that the Philippines generates over 2 million metric tons of plastic waste annually, with only about 20% being recycled or properly disposed of. The rest ends up in our oceans, where it harms marine life, contaminates the food chain, and poses a threat to human health.

The impacts of plastic pollution on the environment are numerous and severe. Plastic debris in our oceans has been found to be ingested by marine animals, including fish, birds, and mammals, which can lead to blockages, nutrient deficiencies, and even death. Sea turtles, in particular, are vulnerable to plastic pollution, with millions of them entangled or trapped in plastic waste every year.

The effects of plastic pollution on human health are equally concerning. Exposure to plastic debris has been linked to a range of health problems, including cancer, reproductive issues, and respiratory diseases. Additionally, the ingestion of microplastics by humans can lead to the consumption of toxic chemicals, which can have serious consequences for our health.

Furthermore, plastic pollution is also having a significant impact on the economy. The country's tourism industry is a major contributor to its GDP, but the presence of plastic waste in popular tourist destinations is driving visitors away and hurting local businesses.

To address this growing concern, the government must take immediate action to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable practices. One effective strategy is to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies, which hold manufacturers responsible for the waste generated by their products.

For example, the country can adopt a ban on single-use plastics, such as straws, bags, and water bottles, and replace them with biodegradable alternatives. This will not only reduce the amount of plastic waste but also promote innovation in sustainable packaging materials.

Another critical step is to increase public awareness and education about the impacts of plastic pollution. Governments, schools, and community organizations must work together to educate people about the importance of proper waste management and recycling.

Individuals can also make a difference by making conscious choices in their daily lives. Using reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups can significantly reduce our plastic usage. Additionally, supporting businesses that prioritize sustainability and use eco-friendly packaging materials is essential.

In conclusion, plastic pollution is a growing concern in the Philippines that requires immediate attention and action. The government, industries, and individuals must work together to reduce plastic waste, promote sustainable practices, and protect our environment for future generations.",1
41,Gemini1.5-flash,"The concept of federalism has long captivated the Philippine political landscape, promising a solution to decades-old regional disparities and the persistent clamor for greater autonomy. However, the path towards a federal Philippines is fraught with challenges, raising critical questions about its feasibility, potential benefits, and potential pitfalls.

The Allure of Federalism:

Proponents of federalism argue that it offers several potential advantages:

Regional Autonomy: By devolving power to regional governments, federalism aims to empower local communities to address their unique needs and concerns more effectively. This could lead to more responsive and efficient governance, tailored to the specific realities of different regions.
Economic Development: Decentralized governance could unlock the economic potential of regions by allowing them to leverage their own resources and attract investments more effectively.
Peace and Order: In regions plagued by insurgency and conflict, such as Mindanao, federalism is seen as a potential pathway to lasting peace and reconciliation by granting greater autonomy to marginalized groups.
Reduced Centralization: Federalism aims to break the stranglehold of centralized power in Manila, fostering a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities across the archipelago.
The Roadblocks and Concerns:

However, the path towards a federal Philippines is fraught with significant challenges:

Defining Federalism: There is no single definition of federalism. The lack of a clear and universally accepted framework for federalism in the Philippine context creates confusion and hinders meaningful dialogue.
Economic Viability: Concerns have been raised about the economic viability of smaller, more autonomous regions. Some fear that smaller units may lack the resources and capacity to effectively govern themselves and provide essential services to their citizens.
Social and Political Divisions: The creation of new political units could exacerbate existing social and political divisions, potentially leading to increased regionalism and even secessionist movements.
Risk of Fragmentation: Critics argue that federalism could lead to the fragmentation of the nation, weakening national unity and undermining the country's capacity to address national challenges.
Constitutional Amendments: Shifting to a federal system would require significant constitutional amendments, a complex and politically challenging process that could face strong opposition from various stakeholders.

42,Gemini1.5-flash,"The health of a democracy hinges on the integrity of its electoral processes. In the Philippines, the interplay between campaign finance, transparency, and the overall democratic experience is a complex and often contentious issue. While laws exist to regulate campaign spending and ensure transparency, significant challenges remain, hindering the realization of a truly level playing field and undermining public trust in government.

The Ideal: Fair Elections and Informed Voters

In a truly democratic system, elections should be contests of ideas, not of wealth. Campaign finance regulations aim to level the playing field, ensuring that candidates with merit and popular support, not just deep pockets, have a fair chance to compete. Transparency in campaign finance is crucial for several reasons:

Informed Voter Choice: When voters have access to information about the sources of campaign funding, they can make more informed decisions. They can assess whether candidates are beholden to special interests or truly represent the will of the people.
Reduced Corruption: Transparent campaign finance helps to deter corruption by making it more difficult for candidates to engage in illicit activities such as money laundering, bribery, and the use of undisclosed funds.
Increased Public Trust: When citizens can see how political campaigns are funded and how politicians are spending public money, they are more likely to trust that their government is acting in their best interests.
Promoting Accountability: Transparency in campaign finance allows for greater public scrutiny of political activities. Citizens and civil society organizations can monitor campaign spending, identify potential conflicts of interest, and hold politicians accountable for their actions.
The Reality: Challenges and Loopholes

Despite the existence of laws regulating campaign finance, significant challenges remain in achieving true transparency and accountability in Philippine elections:

Weak Enforcement: Weak enforcement of existing laws allows for widespread circumvention of regulations. Loopholes in the law are exploited, and penalties for violations are often inadequate or rarely enforced.
Lack of Political Will: There is often a lack of political will to effectively enforce campaign finance laws, particularly when powerful politicians are implicated.
Limited Resources: Understaffed and underfunded election authorities struggle to effectively monitor campaign spending and investigate potential violations.
Opaque Sources of Funding: Many sources of campaign funding remain opaque, making it difficult to track the true origins of campaign funds.
Rise of ""Dark Money"": The rise of ""dark money"" – contributions from undisclosed sources – poses a significant challenge to campaign finance transparency.
The Impact on Democracy:

The lack of transparency in campaign finance has serious implications for Philippine democracy:

Erosion of Public Trust: The perception of corruption and undue influence in politics erodes public trust in government institutions and undermines the legitimacy of the electoral process.
Unequal Playing Field: Wealthy candidates and those with access to significant financial resources enjoy an unfair advantage, hindering the participation of ordinary citizens in the political process.
Distorted Policy-Making: The influence of large donors can distort the political process, leading to policies that favor the interests of wealthy elites rather than the needs of the general public.
Increased Vulnerability to Corruption: Lack of transparency creates opportunities for corruption, such as bribery, extortion, and the misuse of public funds.
Towards a More Transparent and Accountable System:

To strengthen the integrity of the electoral process and enhance public trust, several key steps are crucial:

Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms: Enhancing the capacity of election authorities to investigate and prosecute violations of campaign finance laws.
Closing Loopholes in the Law: Revising and strengthening campaign finance laws to close loopholes and address emerging challenges, such as the rise of ""dark money.""
Improving Data Accessibility: Making campaign finance data more accessible to the public through online platforms and user-friendly formats.
Promoting Public Awareness: Conducting public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities in relation to campaign finance.
Encouraging Civil Society Engagement: Encouraging the active participation of civil society organizations in monitoring campaign finance and advocating for electoral reforms.
Conclusion:

Transparency in campaign finance is not merely a technical issue; it is a fundamental pillar of a healthy democracy. By strengthening existing laws, improving enforcement mechanisms, and promoting public awareness, the Philippines can move towards a more level playing field in its electoral processes, where candidates are elected based on their merit and their vision for the country, not on the size of their bank accounts. This is a critical step towards restoring public trust in government and ensuring that democracy truly serves the interests of all Filipinos.",1

46,Copilot,"The concept of federalism has been a recurring theme in the political discourse of the Philippines for over a century. Advocates argue that a federal system could address the country's longstanding issues of regional inequality, inefficiency in governance, and the concentration of power in ""imperial Manila."" This editorial explores the history, arguments for and against federalism, and its potential impact on the Philippines.

Historical Context
The idea of federalism in the Philippines dates back to the late 19th century. Filipino revolutionary leaders like Emilio Aguinaldo and Apolinario Mabini envisioned a federal structure that would divide the country into three states: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao1. This vision was rooted in the desire to create a more balanced and representative government that could address the diverse needs of the archipelago.

In the modern era, federalism gained renewed attention during the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, who campaigned on a platform that included the promise of shifting to a federal system2. Duterte's push for federalism was driven by the belief that decentralization could promote regional development and address the grievances of marginalized areas, particularly in Mindanao2.

Arguments for Federalism
Proponents of federalism in the Philippines present several compelling arguments:

Decentralization of Power: Federalism would distribute power more evenly across the country, reducing the dominance of Metro Manila. This decentralization could lead to more responsive and accountable local governments1.

Economic Development: By granting regions greater control over their resources and policies, federalism could spur economic development in underdeveloped areas. Local governments would have the autonomy to tailor economic strategies to their specific needs3.

Addressing Regional Inequality: Federalism could help bridge the gap between wealthy and poor regions. By empowering local governments, it could ensure a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities3.

Cultural and Ethnic Representation: The Philippines is home to diverse cultural and ethnic groups. A federal system could provide better representation and autonomy for these groups, fostering a sense of inclusion and reducing regional tensions2.

Improved Governance: Decentralized governance could lead to more efficient and effective public services. Local governments, being closer to the people, could respond more swiftly to their needs and concerns3.

Arguments Against Federalism
Despite its potential benefits, federalism also faces significant opposition and challenges:

Risk of Fragmentation: Critics argue that federalism could lead to the fragmentation of the country. The creation of autonomous regions might encourage separatist movements and weaken national unity4.

Economic Disparities: There is a concern that federalism could exacerbate economic disparities between regions. Wealthier regions might thrive, while poorer ones could struggle without sufficient support from the central government4.

Implementation Challenges: Transitioning to a federal system would require significant constitutional changes and a comprehensive overhaul of existing institutions. This process could be complex, costly, and time-consuming4.

Political Dynasties: Federalism might entrench political dynasties at the regional level. Local elites could consolidate power, leading to corruption and patronage politics4.

Lack of Preparedness: Some argue that the Philippines is not yet ready for federalism. The country needs to strengthen its institutions and governance mechanisms before undertaking such a radical shift4.

Potential Impact on Governance and Society
If implemented effectively, federalism could have a transformative impact on the Philippines:

Enhanced Local Governance: Federalism could empower local governments to address their unique challenges and opportunities. This could lead to more innovative and context-specific solutions to local issues3.

Economic Growth: By promoting regional development, federalism could stimulate economic growth across the country. Regions would have the autonomy to attract investments, develop infrastructure, and create jobs3.

Social Cohesion: Federalism could foster a sense of belonging and representation among diverse cultural and ethnic groups. This inclusivity could strengthen social cohesion and reduce regional conflicts2.

Political Accountability: Decentralized governance could enhance political accountability. Local leaders would be more directly accountable to their constituents, leading to better governance and reduced corruption3.

National Unity: While there are concerns about fragmentation, a well-designed federal system could actually strengthen national unity by addressing regional grievances and promoting a more balanced distribution of power2.

Conclusion
The debate over federalism in the Philippines is complex and multifaceted. While it offers the promise of decentralization, regional development, and improved governance, it also poses significant risks and challenges. The success of federalism would depend on careful planning, robust institutions, and a commitment to equitable development.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt federalism should be guided by a thorough and inclusive dialogue that considers the diverse perspectives and needs of all Filipinos. By addressing the root causes of regional inequality and fostering a more inclusive political system, the Philippines can move towards a more prosperous and united future.",1
47,Copilot,"Election campaign finance transparency is a cornerstone of democratic integrity. In the Philippines, where elections are a vibrant and essential part of the political landscape, ensuring transparency in campaign finance is crucial to maintaining public trust and preventing corruption. This editorial explores the current state of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, the challenges faced, and potential solutions to enhance accountability.

The Legal Framework
The Philippines has established a legal framework to promote transparency in election campaign finance. Key laws and regulations include:

Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881): This code requires every candidate and political party treasurer to submit a full, true, and itemized statement of all contributions and expenditures related to the election1.

Republic Act No. 7166: This act provides for synchronized national and local elections and elaborates on the deadlines, required contents, and significance of submitting the Statement of Contributions and Expenses (SOCE). It also prescribes penalties for non-compliance1.

COMELEC Resolutions: The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) issues resolutions before each election cycle to set specific guidelines for the submission of the SOCE, detailing requirements such as formats, additional information, and deadlines1.

These regulations aim to ensure that all financial activities related to election campaigns are disclosed, promoting transparency and accountability.

The Role of the SOCE
The SOCE is a critical component of Philippine election law. It requires candidates, political parties, and contributors to disclose their financial activities related to the election campaign. The SOCE must include:

Contributions: A detailed listing of all contributions received, including cash contributions, in-kind donations (e.g., services, goods, property), and any other forms of support. The source of each contribution must be clearly stated, specifying the name of the donor, their address, and the amount/value of the contribution1.
Expenditures: All campaign-related expenditures must be itemized, including expenses for advertisements, rallies, staff, equipment, and transportation. The expenditures must comply with the limitations and prohibitions set forth under election law1.
Disclosure of Unspent Contributions: Any unused contributions must also be declared. Under the law, such amounts should be returned to the donors or turned over to the national treasury if donors are not identifiable1.
Challenges to Transparency
Despite the legal framework, several challenges hinder the effective implementation of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines:

Weak Enforcement: The enforcement of campaign finance laws is often weak. COMELEC, the body responsible for overseeing elections, faces resource constraints and lacks the capacity to thoroughly audit all SOCE submissions2.

Political Dynasties and Influence: The prevalence of political dynasties and the influence of wealthy individuals and corporations can undermine transparency efforts. These entities often have the resources to circumvent regulations and exert undue influence on the electoral process2.

Misinformation and Lack of Awareness: Many candidates and contributors are either unaware of the requirements or deliberately choose to ignore them. This lack of awareness and the spread of misinformation can lead to non-compliance2.

Inconsistent Reporting: The quality and consistency of SOCE submissions vary widely. Some candidates provide detailed and accurate reports, while others submit incomplete or misleading information2.

Potential Solutions
To enhance campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, several measures can be taken:

Strengthening Enforcement: COMELEC should be provided with adequate resources and authority to enforce campaign finance laws effectively. This includes increasing its capacity to audit SOCE submissions and imposing stricter penalties for non-compliance2.

Promoting Public Awareness: Educating candidates, political parties, and the public about the importance of campaign finance transparency is crucial. Public awareness campaigns can help ensure that all stakeholders understand their responsibilities and the consequences of non-compliance2.

Leveraging Technology: Implementing digital platforms for the submission and auditing of SOCEs can improve efficiency and accuracy. Online systems can facilitate real-time monitoring and make it easier for COMELEC to identify discrepancies2.

Encouraging Civil Society Participation: Civil society organizations can play a vital role in promoting transparency. By monitoring campaign finance activities and advocating for reforms, these organizations can help hold candidates and political parties accountable2.

Enhancing Legal Provisions: Revising and updating campaign finance laws to address current challenges and loopholes is essential. This includes setting clearer guidelines for contributions and expenditures and ensuring that all financial activities are transparently reported2.

Conclusion
Transparency in election campaign finance is fundamental to the integrity of the democratic process in the Philippines. While the country has established a robust legal framework, challenges remain in ensuring effective implementation and compliance. By strengthening enforcement, promoting public awareness, leveraging technology, encouraging civil society participation, and enhancing legal provisions, the Philippines can move towards a more transparent and accountable electoral system. Ensuring that all financial activities related to election campaigns are disclosed and scrutinized is not only a legal requirement but also a moral imperative to uphold the principles of democracy and good governance.",1
48,Copilot,"Mental health stigma remains a significant barrier to well-being in the Philippines. Despite recent progress, many Filipinos still face prejudice and misunderstanding when it comes to mental health issues. This editorial explores the roots of mental health stigma in the Philippines, its impact on individuals and society, and the steps needed to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment.

The Roots of Mental Health Stigma
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is deeply rooted in cultural, religious, and historical contexts. Several factors contribute to this pervasive issue:

Cultural Values: Filipino culture places a high value on resilience and endurance. The concept of ""hiya"" (shame) and ""pakikisama"" (the need to conform and maintain social harmony) often discourages individuals from openly discussing their mental health struggles1. Admitting to mental health issues is sometimes seen as a sign of weakness or a personal failing.

Religious Beliefs: In a predominantly Catholic country, mental health issues are sometimes attributed to a lack of faith or divine punishment1. This belief can lead individuals to seek spiritual rather than medical solutions, delaying or avoiding professional help.

Lack of Public Health Education: There is a widespread lack of understanding about mental health conditions. Terms like ""baliw"" (crazy) are often used indiscriminately to describe a range of mental health issues, reflecting a lack of nuanced understanding2. This ignorance perpetuates stereotypes and misconceptions.

The Impact of Stigma
The stigma surrounding mental health has far-reaching consequences for individuals and society:

Delayed Treatment: Many Filipinos delay seeking help due to fear of judgment and discrimination1. This can lead to the worsening of mental health conditions and increased risk of suicide. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 3.3 million Filipinos live with depression, yet many do not receive the care they need1.

Discrimination: Stigma leads to discrimination in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and social interactions1. Individuals with mental health conditions may face exclusion and prejudice, further exacerbating their struggles.

Economic Burden: Untreated mental health issues can result in decreased productivity and increased healthcare costs1. The economic impact of mental health stigma is significant, affecting not only individuals but also the broader economy.

Social Isolation: Stigma can lead to social isolation, as individuals may withdraw from their communities to avoid judgment1. This isolation can worsen mental health conditions and hinder recovery.

Steps Towards Change
Addressing mental health stigma in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach:

Education and Awareness: Increasing public awareness about mental health is crucial. Educational campaigns can help dispel myths and misconceptions, promoting a more accurate understanding of mental health conditions1. Schools, workplaces, and community organizations should be involved in these efforts.

Legislation and Policy: The passage of the Mental Health Act of 2018 was a significant milestone2. This law aims to provide accessible and affordable mental health services, integrate mental health education into schools, and raise public awareness. Continued support for such legislation is essential to ensure its effective implementation.

Accessible Mental Health Services: Expanding access to mental health services is vital. This includes increasing the number of mental health professionals, improving facilities, and ensuring that services are available in both urban and rural areas1. Telehealth services can also play a role in reaching underserved populations.

Community Support: Building supportive communities is key to reducing stigma. Community-based programs that provide safe spaces for individuals to discuss their mental health can foster understanding and acceptance1. Peer support groups and mental health advocates can also play a crucial role.

Media Representation: The media has a powerful influence on public perceptions. Promoting accurate and compassionate portrayals of mental health in the media can help challenge stereotypes and reduce stigma1. Influential personalities sharing their mental health journeys can also normalize conversations around this topic.

Encouraging Open Dialogue: Creating an environment where people feel comfortable discussing their mental health is essential. Encouraging open dialogue within families, schools, and workplaces can help break down barriers and promote a culture of acceptance1.

Conclusion
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is a complex issue that requires concerted efforts from all sectors of society. By addressing the cultural, religious, and educational roots of stigma, and by promoting awareness, legislation, and community support, the Philippines can move towards a more inclusive and supportive environment for individuals with mental health conditions. Breaking the silence and fostering open conversations about mental health is not only a matter of individual well-being but also a crucial step towards a healthier and more equitable society.",1

As the country continues to urbanize rapidly, these challenges have significant implications for economic growth, social equity, and overall quality of life. This editorial explores the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to these intertwined problems.

The State of Urban Congestion
Urban congestion, particularly in Metro Manila, is a daily reality for millions of Filipinos. According to the 2023 TomTom Traffic Index, Metro Manila has the longest average travel time to traverse a 10-kilometer route among 387 cities worldwide, taking an average of 25 minutes and 30 seconds1. This congestion results in significant economic losses, estimated at around $4 billion annually due to lost productivity2.

Several factors contribute to this severe congestion:

High Population Density: Metro Manila is one of the most densely populated urban areas globally, with over 13 million residents2. The high population density exacerbates traffic congestion as more people rely on the same limited road infrastructure.

Inadequate Public Transportation: The public transportation system in Metro Manila is often overcrowded and inefficient. Many residents resort to using private vehicles, which occupy more road space and contribute to traffic jams3.

Urban Planning Issues: The city's layout and infrastructure have not kept pace with its rapid growth. Poor urban planning has led to bottlenecks and inefficient traffic flow4.

Economic Activity Concentration: Major business districts and shopping centers are concentrated along key routes like EDSA, further increasing traffic volume in these areas4.

The State of Housing Shortages
The Philippines faces a severe housing crisis, with a backlog of approximately 6.5 million homes5. This shortage is particularly acute in urban areas, where rapid population growth and urbanization have outpaced the supply of affordable housing.

Key factors contributing to the housing shortage include:

Rapid Urbanization: As more Filipinos move to cities in search of better opportunities, the demand for housing has surged. Urban centers like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao are struggling to accommodate this influx5.

High Land Costs: The cost of land in urban areas is prohibitively high, making it difficult for low-income families to afford housing. This has led to the proliferation of informal settlements5.

Inadequate Housing Policies: Despite various government initiatives, the implementation of housing policies has been inconsistent. Bureaucratic hurdles and slow permitting processes have hindered the development of affordable housing5.

Economic Inequality: The disparity in income levels means that many Filipinos cannot afford decent housing. This inequality is reflected in the high number of informal settlers living in substandard conditions5.

Impacts of Urban Congestion and Housing Shortages
The impacts of urban congestion and housing shortages are far-reaching:

Economic Costs: Traffic congestion leads to lost productivity and increased transportation costs. It also affects the delivery of goods and services, impacting businesses and the economy2.

Health and Well-being: Prolonged exposure to traffic pollution can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. Additionally, the stress of long commutes affects mental health and overall well-being2.

Social Inequality: Housing shortages exacerbate social inequality, as low-income families are forced to live in informal settlements with inadequate access to basic services like clean water, sanitation, and electricity5.

Environmental Degradation: Urban sprawl and the lack of green spaces contribute to environmental degradation. Informal settlements often encroach on environmentally sensitive areas, leading to deforestation and pollution5.

Potential Solutions
Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multi-faceted approach:

Improving Public Transportation: Investing in efficient and reliable public transportation systems is crucial. Expanding the existing train networks, implementing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, and improving the quality of buses and jeepneys can reduce the reliance on private vehicles2.

Smart Urban Planning: Adopting smart urban planning practices can help alleviate congestion. This includes creating mixed-use developments that reduce the need for long commutes, implementing zoning laws that promote balanced development, and improving traffic management systems3.

Affordable Housing Initiatives: Increasing the supply of affordable housing is essential. Public-private partnerships can leverage funding for housing projects, while government incentives can encourage private developers to invest in low-cost housing5. Innovative solutions like modular homes and sustainable building materials can also help address the housing shortage6.

Strengthening Housing Policies: Streamlining the permitting process and reducing bureaucratic hurdles can accelerate the development of affordable housing. Ensuring that housing policies are effectively implemented and monitored is crucial5.

Community Involvement: Engaging communities in the planning and development process can lead to more sustainable and inclusive solutions. Community-led initiatives, such as cooperative housing projects and local infrastructure improvements, can empower residents and address their specific needs5.

Environmental Sustainability: Promoting environmentally sustainable practices in urban development can mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization. This includes incorporating green spaces, promoting energy-efficient buildings, and implementing waste management systems7.

Conclusion
Urban congestion and housing shortages are complex challenges that require coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and civil society. By investing in public transportation, adopting smart urban planning practices, increasing the supply of affordable housing, and promoting community involvement, the Philippines can address these issues and improve the quality of life for its citizens. Ensuring that urban development is sustainable and inclusive is not only a matter of necessity but also a crucial step towards a more equitable and prosperous future.",1

The Philippines generates approximately 2.7 million metric tons of plastic waste annually, with a significant portion ending up in the ocean1. A study by Ocean Conservancy and McKinsey identified the Philippines as the third-largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution globally1. This alarming statistic underscores the magnitude of the problem and the urgent need for effective interventions.

Causes of Plastic Pollution
Several factors contribute to the severe plastic pollution problem in the Philippines:

Single-Use Plastics: The widespread use of single-use plastics, such as sachets, bags, and bottles, is a major contributor to plastic waste. These items are often discarded after a single use, leading to significant environmental pollution2.

Inadequate Waste Management: The country's waste management infrastructure is insufficient to handle the volume of plastic waste generated. Only about 33% of waste is properly managed, with the rest ending up in landfills, rivers, and oceans3. The lack of sanitary landfills and proper waste disposal facilities exacerbates the problem4.

Urban Runoff and Improper Disposal: Urban runoff and improper waste disposal practices contribute to the leakage of plastic waste into waterways. In metropolitan areas like Manila, waste management systems are often overwhelmed, leading to significant plastic pollution3.

Economic and Cultural Factors: The ""tingi-tingi"" culture, where products are sold in small, disposable packaging, is prevalent due to economic constraints. This practice results in a high volume of plastic waste5.

Impacts of Plastic Pollution
The impacts of plastic pollution in the Philippines are far-reaching and multifaceted:

Environmental Damage: Plastic pollution poses a dire threat to marine ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion, starvation, and death3. Additionally, plastic waste damages coral reefs and mangrove forests, which are critical for coastal protection and marine biodiversity3.

Public Health Risks: The improper disposal of plastics can lead to the leaching of toxic chemicals into the soil and water, posing health risks to communities5. Microplastics, which are small plastic particles, can enter the food chain and potentially impact human health.

Economic Costs: Plastic pollution affects industries such as fishing and tourism, which are vital to the Philippine economy. The presence of plastic waste in coastal areas can lead to reduced fish stocks and a decline in tourism, resulting in economic losses for local communities5.

Social Inequality: Coastal communities, which often rely on fishing and tourism for their livelihoods, are disproportionately affected by plastic pollution. These communities face economic and health challenges due to the presence of plastic waste in their environment3.

Potential Solutions
Addressing plastic pollution in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach:

Policy Reforms: Strengthening regulations on single-use plastics and implementing incentives for businesses to adopt sustainable packaging alternatives are crucial steps. The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Act, which holds manufacturers accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, is a significant policy initiative6. This law requires businesses to manage the waste generated by their products, promoting sustainable practices.

Improving Waste Management: Enhancing waste management infrastructure is essential to reduce plastic pollution. This includes increasing the number of sanitary landfills, improving waste collection systems, and promoting recycling and materials sustainability6. Local government units (LGUs) play a critical role in managing waste at the municipal level.

Promoting a Circular Economy: Transitioning to a circular economy, where products are designed for reuse, recycling, and minimal waste, can significantly reduce plastic pollution7. This approach involves redesigning products and packaging to minimize waste and encouraging the use of biodegradable materials.

Community Engagement and Education: Raising awareness about the impacts of plastic pollution and promoting community involvement in waste management initiatives are vital. Educational campaigns can help change public attitudes towards plastic use and encourage more sustainable behaviors3.

Clean-Up Initiatives: Organizing clean-up drives and community-based waste collection programs can help remove plastic waste from the environment. These initiatives also raise awareness and foster a sense of responsibility among citizens3.

International Collaboration: Addressing plastic pollution requires global cooperation. The Philippines can benefit from sharing best practices and collaborating with other countries and international organizations to develop effective strategies for reducing plastic waste6.

Conclusion
Plastic pollution is a complex and pressing issue that demands immediate and sustained action. By implementing comprehensive policy reforms, improving waste management infrastructure, promoting a circular economy, and engaging communities, the Philippines can make significant strides in addressing this environmental crisis. Ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment is not only essential for the well-being of current and future generations but also crucial for the country's economic and social development. The fight against plastic pollution is a collective responsibility that requires the commitment and cooperation of all sectors of society.",1

1,John Nery,"The success of the Marcos-Duterte electoral alliance in 2022 was so massive it could be said that the political equivalent of Newton’s law of inertia applied to it. A body moving at constant speed in a straight line will continue moving at constant speed in a straight line unless a force acted upon it. The alliance – if all went well, if the different parts moved at the same speed and kept to the same line – had a lock on the 2028 presidential election, which in our part of the universe determines other political possibilities. And then a force acted upon it. Now the alliance has descended into a war of the dynasties, between the Marcoses and the Dutertes, and an opening is starting to form, not necessarily for the political opposition but perhaps for a political third force led by someone like the populist, and popular, Senator Raffy Tulfo.But the reality of politics has always been messy; perhaps Newton’s laws of motion cannot really explain it. For some analysts, the break between the Marcoses and the Dutertes was inevitable; inertia was never an explanation. But some politicians believed in the alliance, and continue to do so even in the middle of the dynastic war; the law of action and reaction governs their pragmatic attempts to end it. Another way to look at the political situation today, to understand the “chaos” affecting the political class, is to borrow the theory at the heart of the popular Netflix series, 3-Body Problem, based on Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem trilogy. What is the three-body problem? The character Wang Miao explains: “It’s actually pretty simple. The reason why the sun’s motion seems patternless is because our world has three suns. Under the influence of their mutually perturbing gravitational attraction, their movements are unpredictable – the three-body problem. When our planet revolves around one of the suns in a stable orbit, that’s a Stable Era. When one or more of the other suns move within a certain distance, their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it’s orbiting, causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns. That’s a Chaotic Era. After an uncertain amount of time, our planet is once again pulled into a temporary orbit and another Stable Era begins. This is a football game at the scale of the universe. The players are the three suns, and our planet is the football.” (This excerpt is of course from the Ken Liu translation.) The three suns in the second Marcos administration are President Marcos, his older sister Senator Imee Marcos, and his cousin Speaker Martin Romualdez. We can measure their gravitational pull on the planet of Philippine politics according to three factors: the scale of rehabilitation of the Marcos legacy and name, the question of presidential succession, and the choice of primary geopolitical partner. There must be other criteria, but I suggest that these three form the core. These describe their hold on their moons, account for the difference in their orbits – and explain why the Stable Era promised by the UniTeam’s unprecedented victory has deteriorated into a Chaotic Era. Marcos legacy. I think that President Marcos understands his election in 2022 as a completion of the task his family imposed on him since at least 1995, the first time he ran for national office; he has rehabilitated the Marcos name simply by winning the office his father held for 20 years. His election created the minimum condition of rehabilitation – that the public regard his father no longer as a dictator but as “just another” president, the first Marcos – and I think he is happy to claim the win. Senator Marcos’s definition of rehabilitation is much broader. She wants public opinion to reflect how she thinks of her father, as a great man wronged by history. She wants to restore her father to an imagined gallery of greatness, and this requires nothing less than a repudiation of the Edsa People Power uprising. (On rereading, I see that my July 2022 column “The four REs of the Marcos restoration” actually tracks Imee’s position more closely than her brother’s.) For Imee, it is not enough for the first Marcos to be seen as just another president. Speaker Romualdez’s idea of rehabilitation is just as expansive, but in a different direction. He expects it to cover not only the Marcoses but the Romualdezes too. For him, the true measure of rehabilitation is if another member of their extended family succeeds his cousin. His reading has disturbed others in the political class, even those who warmly welcomed the return of the Marcoses to Malacañang, because it unnecessarily tests the boundaries of political power. One may be willing to concede power to a family for six years, but 12? Presidential Succession. Marcos continues to keep his personal relationship with his vice president warm, even in the face of outright hostility and insolent language from his predecessor the former president and the two Duterte sons. I think he is pragmatic enough to accept a Duterte as a successor, if that is the way his political interests lie; at the same time, he cannot but be open to a Romualdez or a Tulfo, for the same reason. But it seems clear that his influential wife’s counsel is what he will keep. This sub-factor is a particular sticking point with other members of the political class, especially the Dutertes. Imee Marcos was one of Rodrigo Duterte’s original supporters in his long-shot campaign for the presidency in 2016, and was instrumental in convincing Duterte’s more popular daughter Sara to run as Bongbong Marcos’s running mate in 2022. As I see it, she wants her family to honor the explicit or implied agreement with the Dutertes that made the UniTeam tandem possible in the first place: Support Sara for president in 2028. While her definition of political rehabilitation is maximalist, her understanding of the dynamic of presidential elections is much more pragmatic. She sees Sara as still the candidate to beat in 2028 AND also the president who can consolidate the gains of the Marcoses best. From all indications, Speaker Romualdez wants to become the next president. He may still run for a third term as representative of the 1st District of Leyte next year, but his long-term strategy may likely involve a Senate run in 2025. A strong showing would place him in strong contention for 2028. (See Gloria Arroyo in 1995, or Grace Poe in 2013.) The ongoing campaign to raise his profile in different congressional districts is an expensive signal; to give only one example, the constituency-serving facility set up on Kamuning Street in Quezon City, while ostensibly an alliance between the district representative and his wife Yedda Romualdez’s Tingog party-list group, features only one larger-than-life image: his. Superpower Ally. Before Marcos came to power, I thought he would continue moving in the direction set by President Duterte’s pivot to China; his family’s historical ties with Chinese leadership weighed heavily in my estimate. Instead, he has firmly redirected Philippine foreign policy back to Washington DC and the Western alliance. This must stem in part from the recognition that there is an international aspect to the project of rehabilitation; in his view, the course of cleaning up the family name runs through key Western capitals. Senator Marcos would favor a return to the Duterte China-first policy. The language she used in presenting her seven-point plan in September 2022 as Senate foreign affairs committee chair speaks of “engagement” with Beijing, but her remarks since then suggest collaboration rather than engagement, to the extent that today she is seen as the principal non-Duterte defender of China. (She resents this perception.) Romualdez has controversially accompanied the President on many of his foreign travels, in part to assert his idea of “legislative diplomacy” and his ideal of Congress as a full partner of the Executive in foreign policy. But he shares the pro-Western view of his cousin, Ambassador to the United States Babe Romualdez; donated $2 million to fund a Tagalog course in Harvard University; has consistently supported the strengthening of Philippine-American ties. As president, he would likely deepen the Philippine partnership with the United States. Chaotic era. In the last two years, the three suns have each increased in mass. Romualdez’s Lakas-CMD is now the largest single party in Congress, and he has proved that he can make Congress jump through hoops. Imee has reinforced her ties with the Dutertes, who have been welcoming former allies (such as former Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez) back into the fold; at the same time, she has leaned into her role as a dependable source, “good copy,” for the media. The President remains buoyed both by constant travel and the warm welcome of Western allies; the scope of influence of his wife Lisa Araneta Marcos has also widened. As a result, their “mutually perturbing gravitational attraction ” has also grown. The turmoil within the ruling coalition includes many celestial anomalies: a stealthy two-pronged campaign to change the Constitution; open conflict between the Senate and the House; a tightening of the net around key Duterte allies; the suddenly more substantial shadow of the International Criminal Court looming from The Hague; even more aggressive interventions by Beijing in the West Philippine Sea; ever closer ties with Washington, Tokyo, Canberra, London. All this instability can be explained simply. There are three competing centers of gravity within the extended Marcos family.",0
2,John Nery,"The war on Ninoy Aquino’s legacy is a fight the political opposition should welcome, and win. It wasn’t a surprise, but for many who recognize Ninoy Aquino’s heroism, the orchestrated attacks on his legacy on the anniversary of his assassination, subverting the very meaning of his martyrdom, still came as a shock. Maybe it was the brazenness of the deceitful counterclaims, or maybe it was the sheer scale of the networked campaign, or maybe it was the sinking sense that a new nightmare in disinformation and historical denialism had begun – but the blow that shocked many into a defensive crouch was visceral, real. Can all of that history really be denied? The fact that he was killed by Marcos’s soldiers, the fact that millions of people turned out for his funeral, the fact that his sacrifice galvanized the opposition, the fact that his death in 1983 led to the end of the Marcos regime in 1986: Can all of that be deliberately forgotten, or reinterpreted, or hashtagged away? Marcos and Duterte allies are certainly trying. The groundwork had been laid during the Duterte years, when legislation to change the name of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, the country’s main gateway, was first filed. Alarms over the possible removal of the image of Aquino on the P500 bill (part of the design since 1987) and that of his wife, the late president Cory Aquino (included in the design in 2010), were also first raised under the Duterte administration, when the Bangko Sentral initiated a new currency series that replaced heroes with Philippine flora and fauna. But the anti-Ninoy campaign grew in volume and viciousness after Ferdinand Marcos Jr. won the presidency. One of the first bills filed in the 19th Congress sought the renaming of the airport from Aquino to the man with final responsibility for his assassination, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos himself, on the mistaken assumption that Marcos built the airport. A day before the 39th anniversary of the assassination, a handful of police accounts on social media used the hashtags #NinoyNotHero (sic) and #NinoyNPA in bizarre posts that were later taken down. And on the day of the anniversary, the coordinated smear campaign against Aquino erupted into full view: He was denounced as a traitor, tagged as a communist, blamed as a destabilizer or a chaos-maker. And though the August 21 anniversary (which fell on a Sunday this year) remained a national holiday, the main institutions of government kept silent. No statements were issued. In his first State of the Nation Address the previous month, President Marcos Jr. deliberately avoided mentioning Aquino’s name; he spoke of creating “more international airports to help decongest the bottleneck in the Manila Airport.” The policy of official silence on the anniversary, then, was all of a piece.To be sure, Marcos issued Proclamation No. 42 the day after Ninoy Aquino Day, listing the official holidays for 2023; both August 21 and February 25, the anniversary of the People Power revolution that drove the Marcoses from Malacañang, were still on the list. As I wrote before, I expect it will take him three years to finally drop the two holidays.  But I could be wrong. Of the factions in the ruling coalition, there is at least one that is maximalist; it seeks to rehabilitate the father AND degrade the father’s political archrival as quickly as possible. Republic Act 9256, which declared Aquino’s death anniversary a holiday, can be repealed within a matter of months. Coalition Objectives. Why the zeal to erase Ninoy Aquino from history? Most of the parties and factions that comprise the ruling coalition, with the possible exception of the marginalized Arroyo group, are invested in reinterpreting mainstream Philippine history because a national narrative that celebrates Aquino as hero is necessarily a narrative that assumes Marcos as villain. The dictator was gravely ill on the day Aquino was killed; it is very likely that while he approved his wife Imelda’s repeated attempts to warn Aquino against coming back because of the risk of assassination, he did not directly order the killing. He must have anticipated, if not the scale, then at least the kind, of consequences you reap when you turn your rival into a martyr. But Marcos did arrest Aquino when Martial Law took effect; he did imprison Aquino for seven years on made-up charges; he did allow a military court to try, and eventually, convict, a civilian defendant; he did install a dictatorship that denied Filipinos their basic freedoms; he did create the conditions that by the early 1980s had pushed the country to the brink of social upheaval; he did manufacture a subservient military that produced the soldiers who killed Aquino. Marcos bears final responsibility for Aquino’s sprawled corpse on the airport tarmac. That that airport has borne Aquino’s name since December 1987 (through a law that was enacted without the approval of his widow, the president at that time) is a continuing reminder of that ultimate responsibility. That is why President Marcos Jr. couldn’t even say the airport’s full name; his father and his family are implicated every time the name is invoked. The Marcoses have apparently forgiven the late president Fidel Ramos for his crucial role in their ouster; they have not only forgiven their father’s defense secretary, Juan Ponce Enrile, for defecting from the Marcos regime, they have welcomed him into the official family as chief presidential legal counsel. The truth is that many of those who made the EDSA revolution happen have found ways to work with the Marcoses when they returned to political office. In that sense, EDSA as historical event is easier for the Marcos family to live with, or live down. But the Aquinos are a different matter. Ninoy Aquino and his ragtag Lakas ng Bayan party had humiliated Imelda Marcos during the 1978 Interim Batasang Pambansa elections. Aquino had repeatedly rejected Imelda’s many warnings about not coming home. He could have stayed in comfortable exile in the United States, but decided (exactly like Jose Rizal) to return home to almost certain death. That decision led to the collapse of the Marcos regime, and cemented Marcos’ historical reputation, not as the enlightened strongman he believed he was, but as the brutal dictator the assassination revealed him to be. To rehabilitate Marcos’s name and legacy, Aquino’s role in history must be degraded and denied. Opposition Opportunity. It is instructive to remember that when rumors of Aquino’s impending return circulated in 1983, the Marcos-controlled press (in an amazing display of editorial synchronicity) began printing unflattering, previously published stories about the opposition leader. Aquino before his arrest in 1972 was an easy target: rich, glib, flashy young man on the make, surrounded by bodyguards. The stories showed a man of great privilege and even greater ambition. The current campaign against him draws on this portrait – and then adds a layer of outright fabrication. The new script includes old allegations: that he was a communist (or even a founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines); that his absence during the Plaza Miranda bombing of 1971, which was aimed at his fellow Liberal Party members, proved that he was behind the act of terrorism; that he had been naturalized as a Malaysian citizen, and so on. But like Rizal, we remember Aquino because of the last 10 years of his life: seven years in prison and three years in exile changed him, we might even say purified him, and prepared him to be, in the final moment of his life, a hero. I was at that massive funeral for Aquino on August 31, 1983 – 10 years ago on Wednesday. I was one of maybe two million, maybe even three million, who escorted him to his grave. It was the largest funeral in Philippine history, and one of the largest in the world. I was also at EDSA in February 1986, when as many as four million Filipinos thronged the streets. And I was one of the 16.6 million who voted for the 1987 Constitution: an astonishing 77% of all votes cast. I believed then, and I believe now, that all those millions saw Aquino’s sacrifice as a martyrdom, and Aquino as a hero. The bracing thing: Lots of proof exist that Filipinos see Aquino as a hero. Many of the millions who turned out for his funeral or flocked to EDSA and other urban centers elsewhere in the country are still alive; many archives are accessible and easy to use. In other words, the question whether Aquino is a hero, which Marcos and Duterte allies have seeded, is actually a contest that the political opposition should join willingly, because it is winnable. In its present state, the opposition is defensive by default. The war to define Aquino’s heroic legacy, centered on the principle that the Filipino is worth dying for, is an opportunity to go on the offense, to convert hearts and minds, to speak truth with power.

3,John Nery,"One of many lessons from the ongoing Twitter fiasco: Billionaires make up, and bankers believe, all kinds of bullshit. To buy Twitter, Elon Musk had to pay not only the $44-billion acquisition price but also what are called closing costs. The total amount was substantially higher: $46.5 billion. A consortium of major banks, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and Bank of America, provided Musk with almost $13 billion in debt financing. In other words, aside from putting up his own money (largely by selling Tesla stock) and convincing investment funds to take a stake, Musk had to take out a loan. At around the time the acquisition was completed, at the end of October, the banks were already looking at a potential loss of half a billion dollars if they had sold their debt then. Now, according to a Reuters report based on a Financial Times story, the banks are looking to hold on to their debt (that is, not sell them off), having “conceded they will be stuck holding the debt on their books for months or even longer and will probably end up incurring huge losses on the financing package.” Question: How was it possible that ostensibly responsible bankers approved a multi-billion-dollar loan that started losing value the moment the loan was cleared? For ordinary people like you and me, these sums are unreal. Is there any difference between $1 billion and $13 billion, or $44 billion, for the proverbial man or woman on the street? But we presume that bankers (and investors, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs) appreciate the true weight of money. Why then did these bankers back a businessman who did not in fact want to proceed with the acquisition and had to be forced by litigation to complete the purchase? Magical thinking. The answer must lie in a form of collective magical thinking: These bankers and investors believed in Musk, despite the lack of substance in and even the absurdity of his plans for improving Twitter’s business prospects. Last May, the New York Times obtained a copy of the presentation slides – the pitch deck – that Musk used to court investor support for buying Twitter. He projected that from a base of around 7,500 employees, the Twitter workforce would grow to 9,225 this year and to 11,072 in 2025. And yet one of the first things Musk did when he took over Twitter was to fire half of the staff. Over 1,200 more employees resigned after he set a deadline. How can Musk possibly make good on his other grandiose plans for Twitter? He has less than a third of the work force he said needed to be in place by this year. And it’s not as if Musk’s drastic moves were a surprise. His track record at Tesla, the electric-vehicle manufacturer, and at SpaceX, the rocket business, should have warned  bankers and investors that self-created chaos was his playbook. Musk “clearly thrives in existential circumstances,” a former Tesla engineer told the Times. Musk told investors that by 2028 he would grow Twitter’s user base from 217 million in 2021 to 931 million; transform the platform’s payments business from a projected and paltry $15 million in 2023 to about $1.3 billion; and raise company revenue from $5 billion in 2021 to $26.4 billion. These numbers are literally incredible: hard to believe, or even credit. This is the business bullshit that the bankers bought? This is the BS that magical thinking sold. Never mind the Qatari or Saudi investors, who may only need to answer to their sovereigns, but what about the suits in Morgan Stanley, who agreed to loan Musk about $3.5 billion? Do they still have a job? Market mentality. I suppose the answer here is the other side of Musk’s track record; bankers and investors can point to his success at Tesla and at SpaceX. But the free market these capitalists supposedly believe in has in fact been driving down the value of Tesla for a year already. Just last Monday, Bloomberg reported that Musk’s net worth shrank by $8.6 billion. He lost more wealth in one day than the entire fortune of the single richest person in the Philippines, Manny Villar. In the first 11 months of the year, Musk’s net worth fell by an astonishing $100.5 billion – equivalent to about one-fourth of the Philippine GNP. The scale is staggering in itself, but the losses are something else. The cause is clear enough. Fortune magazine noted that since November 2021, when Musk’s wealth was at its peak, “Tesla’s stock has fallen more than 59% as growing recession fears, slowing EV demand, and Musk’s Twitter acquisition have weighed on investors’ confidence.” Tesla is the main source of Musk’s wealth. Aside from internal problems (the most recent recall involved 300,000 cars with a factory defect) and economic difficulties (more expensive raw material, more restrictive China market), Tesla also has to contend with Musk’s new acquisition, Twitter. Some investors “worry that Tesla’s strategy may fall to the wayside” (Fortune); other investors fear that “the billionaire is spreading himself too thin” (Bloomberg). But the real problem is that, in late capitalism, billionaires can lay it on too thick—and bankers, investors, venture capitalists are only too willing, too gullible, to believe them. ",0
4,John Nery,"Of course we all need to be particular about the source of the funds. That is the most important issue. As if to demonstrate the great decline in stature from chief justice of the Supreme Court to ad interim executive secretary and thus temporary chief aide, Lucas Bersamin spent a lot of time in his first press briefing on Tuesday, October 4, offering ridiculous rationalizations for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s weekend getaway to Singapore. The former chief justice did not act at all like a circumspect judge, conscious of the responsibility all public officials bear toward public office. The new executive secretary also did not act any different from the old one, who was accused (even by supporters of President Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte) of a high-handedness born of sheer proximity to power. Instead, Executive Secretary Bersamin made assertions to justify the President’s junket that even law students would have readily picked apart. He prefaced his remarks by saying that he did not have “direct knowledge” of how the President’s trip to Singapore to catch the Formula 1 race was funded. If he was reciting in class, his professor would have ripped this admission wide open. He must have known he would be asked about the Singapore trip; why didn’t he prepare beforehand by determining the source of the funding? Either he was lazy, or unprepared, or irresponsibly incurious. It’s also possible that he made the admission as a way to distance himself from the issue, an attempt to put his answers on less authoritative ground. If he did in fact make that bet, the headlines and stories in the wake of his press briefing show that he wagered wrong. But his admission was merely laying the predicate for his first rationalization: “You don’t need to be too particular about where the funds were sourced.” This is atrocious nonsense, based on the unsaid but false assumption that the President is exempt from standards applied to other public officials. In fact, Bersamin tried to justify this nonsense by referring, broadly, to the implied deference the Administrative Code of 1987 pays, or so he says, to the entire First Family. But nothing in the same Code, or indeed in any other law, says that the basic principle that “public office is a public trust” does not hold for the President and the First Family. Of course we all need to be particular about the source of the funds. That is the most important issue (but, significantly, not the only one). The distinction between the private person and the public official is a measure of political modernity; we no longer make the mistake of thinking that the office is the man. If President Marcos incurs an expense in his private capacity – for instance, buying a ticket to an Eric Clapton concert, or indulging an addiction to nicotine – he must pay for it out of his own pocket. That’s what his salary is for; that’s where his family’s private wealth, the subject of unending litigation, comes in. To say, blithely, as Bersamin did, that the source of funding is “irrelevant,” is to do violence to the constitutional principle of accountability. Bersamin suggested that even he could have paid for the President’s travel, if only he had the money, and it would have been okay. Again, arrant and dangerous nonsense.  If, to follow his own example, he did pay for the President’s trip, then he should be ready to stand accused of buying his new position. Private time. Bersamin’s second rationalization was that the President was on “private time.” He said: “It’s not immodest, it’s not contrary to morals, private time ‘yan.” He was preemptively answering possible ethical questions that could be raised against the President based on principles enshrined in the Constitution and the laws, but he was only indulging in a non-sequitur. Just because an official does something on private time, it doesn’t mean that what he does is necessarily modest, or not contrary to morals. “Private time” doesn’t cover a multitude of sins. And even if, to borrow Bersamin’s own strained metaphor, Marcos Junior had become a “matinee idol” whose very presence at the race added “some suspense and intrigue and some importance to that event,” that new-found celebrity still would not protect the President if he were to commit a crime or a scandal during his own private time. But in fact Bersamin used the private time argument in bad faith, because he had a third rationalization that ran opposite the second. The President, the former justice said, “was still performing his job as President when he was abroad, although that is not an official state visit.” It is easy enough to see how vapid this reasoning is, when you apply it to actual and specific examples. When Marcos watched the Clapton concert, was he still performing his job as President? When he spent hours soaking in the expensive atmosphere of an F1 race, was he doing so as part of his presidential duties? Questions like these are why Bersamin offered the private time argument, but as chief aide he thought it was necessary to add the exact opposite argument, just to cover all the bases. What a disgrace. But he didn’t stop there. To try to deflect public outrage over the President’s insensitive partying in Singapore, at a time when many had not yet recovered from the last typhoon, Bersamin said it was the criticism of the President’s visit that was insensitive. “Yun ang insensitive, yung criticism.” When an avatar of the rule of law is the first to attack the public’s inherent right to criticize erring public officials, he has lost his bearings and has no business serving in government. The irony is that he even thought his own person could serve as the clincher to the argument that the source of funding was irrelevant. But it didn’t – because there was nothing there.",0
5,John Nery,"In 'Some People Need Killing,' the acclaimed journalist's searing, searching account of Rodrigo Duterte’s calamitous 'war on drugs,' we come face to face with the enormity of evil – and the language that enables it. Rodrigo Duterte was the only candidate for Philippine president who promised to kill thousands of his potential voters to solve what he called a drug crisis; he would fill Manila Bay with the corpses of as many as a hundred thousand drug addicts, he said. Once voted into office, he made good on that promise. Some People Need Killing, the journalist Patricia Evangelista’s much-anticipated account of Duterte’s promised war on drugs, includes in its breadth of detail and casualty count and dramatic incident some of those very Duterte voters who ended up killed in Duterte’s war. There is even an entire chapter on Duterte supporters consumed by regret. This may have been an effort on Evangelista’s part to end her harrowing, thoughtful, absorbing account on a less bleak note, but she is above all else a reporter, and her faithful reporting does not sugarcoat reality. Thousands of extrajudicial killings had changed the country irrevocably. A nation of martyrs has become a country of killers. Some of the early vigilantes called it right. We are Duterte, they said. Evangelista’s account is a memoir of her coverage of the EJKs and what led her to it (it is subtitled “A Memoir of Murder in My Country”); but it is also reportage, some new and some already published but expanded, filled with even more detail and drawn with more context, all of it reworked into a whole; it is, lastly, an analysis, of how a democracy can die. Much of that analysis reflects a writer’s sensibility. Evangelista, in the field, looks for the telling detail or the outrageous fact; at her writing table, she looks for the enabling word, the language that kills. In this review’s lead paragraph, for instance, she will likely seize on the idiomatic irony of “making good on” a promise of evil, and write a thoughtful paragraph or page on how ostensibly moral phrasing can subvert morality. Since her twenties, Evangelista has had a reputation for beautiful writing. (It isn’t true, as she asserts in a self-effacing passage, that she was hired to write a column by the Philippine Daily Inquirer only because of her youth.) Her stories from the war on drugs, especially those in Part II, will add to that reputation. “Marcelo worked as a truck driver’s assistant. He lived, with his partner and three children, in a house just a few feet from the shanty where his mother had given birth to him thirty-one years earlier. Unlike many of the Payatas settlements, the Daa home sat in a remote clearing, requiring a long walk downhill from the main highway, through a patch of woods where the thick canopy of trees did little to mask the stench of the nearby dump site. The Daas lived in a lonely huddle of squat houses pieced together from tarps and plywood, their tin roofs weighed down by large rocks and washbasins and a chipped Blue’s Clues doorstop lying on its side. A sixty-foot ravine curved around the edges.” Comparing this paragraph with the original and already fine description, in the Rappler series in which it appeared, the reader can see that the phrasing has tightened, even though more detail had been added. And the reworking of that last sentence, cutting it just so, reflects and raises the tension in that story. But her account also includes passages like these (this one is on “salvage” in Philippine English): “Salvage-as-murder does not exist in most Filipino dictionaries. Nor does the definition appear in the many English-Filipino compendiums that are available for academic use. But every child in my country knows this meaning …. A salvage yard is not a fenced-in path of concrete with secondhand cars and vintage lamps for thrifting. A salvage yard is a street corner in Tondo, or the right lane of an overpass at dawn. A salvage yard is a cemetery, unless there is no one to give the dead man a name.” It is this attention to both detail and diction that sets Evangelista’s work apart. Doing the inconceivable. “I spent much of my time sorting through the convoluted grammar of official police reports,” she writes, in another characteristically self-deprecating self-description. But out of this basic step, Police Beat Reporting 101, she captures the accidental anti-poetry of bureaucratic language, which makes the inconceivable doable. For instance: “Cops [in a buy-bust operation] use the same word for fulfillment as is used for newlyweds: consummation. ‘After the consummated transaction,’ read one police report, ‘poseur-buyer and companion arrested the suspect.’” Another instance: “In the black-and-white of a Philippine spot report, ‘suspect sensed presence of lawmen’ comes just before ‘suspect drew his firearm’.” On August 15, 2017, in what became colloquially known as a One Time Big Time operation, 32 persons were killed in one province alone. At least eight spot reports filed by the police struck a variation of the same theme of presence sensed. Evangelista quotes the reports, and presents them one after the other. “At 12.20 a.m., suspects Bernard Lizardo and Justine Bucacao, ‘after sensing that they were dealing with an undercover police poseur’ …. At 12.40 a.m., suspects Jimmy Gorgon and Bartolome Marin ‘sensed the presence of operatives’.” And so on, until 4.30 am. The cumulative effect is both hilarious and horrifying. And yet another instance: “There is a phrase that has been used whenever police officers sit down to brag about their prowess in the field. It is also a phrase that appears in a certain species of police report …. The suspect is discovered dead, or almost dead, but that discovery occurs only after ‘the smoke of gunfire subsides.’ In Binondo … ‘after the smoke of gun battle subsided’ two suspects were ‘seen sprawled lifeless inside the rooms of the small house.’ In Santa Cruz, ‘when the smoke of gunfire subsided,’ police reported the subject ‘lay in the cemented pavement mortally wounded’. The same is true for a man in Tondo, found dead just after ‘the smoke of gunfire subsided,’ and in Jose Abad Santos, where another subject was found lying on another cemented pavement dead of gunshot wounds—‘after the smoke of gunfire subsided’.” Duterte, more rambling than a police report but with straighter grammar, comes under the same scrutiny. Evangelista’s “sorting” of the President’s speech is a series of compelling compilations, a Greatest Hits collection, of violent rhetoric. She recounts what amounts to Duterte’s origin story, as the man with the iron hand (she carefully indicates, in one of her fastidious endnotes, that Duterte had related this story at least six times). It involves his encounter as a new mayor of Davao City with the unrepentant rapist of an 18-month-old baby. The rapist, asked why he did it, gave a truly monstrous answer. “If that’s the answer you get,” Duterte asked, “what will you do?” But he never did say exactly what he did to the rapist. Just that “I did do something,” with a new revolver he had received for Christmas. Don’t blame him, the President said, “if I am driven also to insanity.” In another 11 speeches, Duterte claimed that 77,000 people had died in the hands of drug addicts in the three to four years before his election. “You know, in the wake of the drug contamination in the Philippines, 77,000 deaths, drug-related. Who will answer for that? Who will take the cudgels for those innocent—the young women raped? The ones held up in jeepneys—who will answer for them?” (Evangelista quickly and completely debunks Duterte’s mistaken statistics.) But the point of all the alleged numbers was dehumanization: “A lot of them are no longer viable as human beings in this planet,” he said. In another seven speeches, at least, “His Excellency Rodrigo Duterte, commander in chief, ordered his own men to violate not just the spirit but the letter of the law.” Shoot the suspect, he said, or hinted at it – and he said it again and again, in Davao City, in Davao again but in another venue, in Clark Freeport, in Marawi City, again in Davao, in Quezon City, in the presidential palace. Language as an enabler. In a particularly provocative passage that runs over four pages, Evangelista questions her own translation of the Filipino word for “beautiful,” in posting about Duterte’s monstrous response to the One Time Big Time operation in Bulacan province, which killed 32 suspects in one night. Of the death toll, the President had said, “Maganda yun.” In her social media, Evangelista posted her translation of the President’s words: “That’s good.” In Some People Need Killing, Evangelista writes: “In Filipino, maganda means ‘beautiful.’ It can also mean ‘good.’ It was unclear what the President meant that afternoon in August, but there was a reason every English-language local news organization chose to use the word good instead of beautiful. Good, as egregious a judgment as it was, was far less outrageous than beautiful. Beautiful would have offered an element of pleasure, a romanticizing of brutality, the impression that the commander in chief of a democratic republic  was not just pleased but delighted by the ruthless killing of his citizens.” What follows is an extraordinary list of the many things that Duterte had called beautiful in public. Perhaps nothing catches both Duterte’s appeal as a leader and the anomaly of his leadership so accurately – and yes, even beautifully – as the list Evangelista put together. It includes the President’s older girlfriend (“more beautiful than the other one”), his sidearm, Melania Trump, his circumcised penis, bodies that “only had one bullet hole in each head” – and yes, 32 suspects killed in one night. If those are the answers you get, what will you do? Evangelista suggests we must pay attention to the normalization of abusive or violent language, because it can quickly become the rhetoric of authoritarian return. Several stories stand out in Evangelista’s account: The fifth man, the tragedy of Heart de Chavez, the bizarre police friend, the slapping of Djastin with a D. The build-up to her one encounter with the vigilante leader known familiarly as Commander Maning is well-paced and thrilling (and differs markedly from the original Rappler series). Only the second chapter seemed to me to be weak; Philippine history was painted with too broad a brush. But I counted 11 instances when her stories, or her writing, stopped me momentarily – and the first of these, a revelation about her grandfather, was in that second chapter. Another passage that stopped me: Her disquisition on the transformation of the word “laban” or fight, associated with the opposition leader Ninoy Aquino, to “nanlaban,” or fought back, now forever part of the enabling language of the war on drugs. She also provides checklists, of a sort. For the aspiring journalist, two pages worth. For the aspiring vigilante, three. The enormity of evil requires more space.

6,John Nery,"The answers she gave in two Senate hearings were mystifying, and deeply problematic. But then the public discourse swirling about her is equally cringeworthy. The views expressed by the writer are his/her own and do not necessarily reflect the views or positions of Rappler. There IS reason to think that she was a mere stand-in for some principal. She said she didn’t know who some of her fellow incorporators were (even though some of them were also listed as incorporators in other businesses she was a part of); she said she didn’t know how much rental income the Baofu compound in Bamban earned, even though she said that before divesting she owned 50% of the company; she said she couldn’t say exactly how much her businessman-father gave her, or how often, but only that the money came in large amounts – half a million, or a million, or 2 million, at a time. There IS reason for the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC), which led the raid on the Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) located in the compound, to believe that she remains involved in Baofu. Part of the evidence trail leads back to her: A letter of no objection she filed on behalf of Hongsheng Gaming Technology, the original company with a POGO license; utility statements for Hongsheng up until November 2023, six months after its license had been canceled and over a year since Guo became mayor; a vehicle in the compound registered to her; a current Tarlac Electric Cooperative bill in her name and title (“Mayor Alice Guo, Pandan, Bamban”). There IS reason for the Department of the Interior and Local Government to seek her preventive suspension. The mystery of the missing grinders and grinder operators is proof of the kind of costly foot-dragging that a sitting mayor can force an entire bureaucracy to adopt. One Friday after the raid, PAOCC enlisted the cooperation of Bamban-based grinder operators to open all the 27 safes and vaults found in the compound the following Monday. That Monday, none of the equipment could be found, and all the operators, whether working for the municipality or in the private sector, were away on what PAOCC was told was a town-sponsored seminar. PAOCC ended up using acetylene torches. And there IS reason for the public to suspect her citizenship was not genuine. The discrepancies in the wedding dates of her listed parents as recorded in her birth certificate (registered when she was already 19) and in the birth certificates of two of her siblings; her own insistence that her father was a Chinese national but all the children’s birth certificates identified him as Filipino; the negative certification from the Philippine Statistics Authority that there is no record of birth of either Angelito Guo or Amelia Leal and no record of their marriage – these irregularities are concerning. But of equal concern, in my view, is the heat and hate, the virulent vitriol, of public opinion about her. Two aspects of the current public discourse swirling about Mayor Guo should give us pause. Filipino racism. In the May 22 Senate hearing, committee chair Senator Risa Hontiveros was careful to say at the start that the issue of Mayor Guo’s citizenship was directly related to the issue under investigation – if unscrupulous operators were using POGO as legal cover to run criminal syndicates that trafficked in persons and forced them into criminal acts. Whether Guo is a Filipino citizen is germane to her ownership of various companies, and of course to her eligibility as mayor. The controversy caused by her two appearances in the Senate has generated a tsunami of social media memes. In my own view, the funniest, but also the most searing, was the juxtaposing of two captioned images from two Senate hearings: above, Guo shown speaking her most memorable line (“Lumaki po ako sa farm” – literally, I grew up on a farm), and below, Senator Cynthia Villar, wife of the country’s richest man and symbol of a business empire with a reputation for turning agricultural land into commercial property, with the imagined caption “Saang farm ba ‘yan (Where is that farm)? A joke very like a condominium: Many levels! But together with all the funny came all the ugly. Guo has been deservedly criticized for her lapses in memory or general evasiveness, but she has also been hated on, insulted, mocked, reviled, for how she looks, how she sounds, how her tongue moves, how Chinese she must be. That is racism, plain and simple. Old attitudes against the Chinese in the Philippines lurk not too far beneath the surface. Scratch the skin, and the insults, the condescension, the paranoia, come spilling out. The trigger doesn’t have to be a controversial mayor’s obvious nonsense under oath; it can be anything, even superlative and exemplary achievement. I remember the case of Tiffany Grace Uy, who graduated summa cum laude from the University of the Philippines in 2015 with the highest general weighted average since before World War II: a 1.004. That new record was headline news, before it became social media fodder. An idiot posted: “Another Chinese blood…listed in the history of UP, a University suppose [sic] to be for FILIPINO and for POOR.” Another wrote: “Chinese amp (short for the expletive ‘amputa,’ itself short for ‘anak ng puta’ or son of a whore) wala bang pure Pinoy naman (is there no pure Filipino this time)?” A third idiot, feeling the compulsion to say something smart, wrote: “Ask her what she’s gna (gonna) do about China’s territorial grabbing – if she is our president now. She will fail.” In comments like these, we can see the familiar patterns of anti-Chinese racism in the Philippines: They know how to make money, they are not true or pure Filipinos, they are not loyal to the Philippines. To be sure, under Xi Jinping’s leadership, Beijing’s aggressive expansionism in the South China Sea and especially in parts of the West Philippine Sea have deepened concerns among the Philippine public; since at least 2012, a steady pulse of majority support beats for a more assertive Philippine response. The possibility that Mayor Guo is not only complicit but actively taking part in a Beijing-directed conspiracy to infiltrate the Philippine political class has of course not been ruled out; the inquiry is continuing. It adds fuel to the fire. But that fire threatens to singe, or even consume, many innocents: good Filipino citizens of Chinese ancestry, who like many of their forebears have chosen to devote their lives to the country. Political sensationalism. As a direct result of the controversy Guo provoked in the May 7 hearing, the next one, on May 22, not only attracted a larger audience but also drew more senators. In previous hearings, it had only been Hontiveros and an equally hardworking Senator Sherwin Gatchalian directing the inquiry. This time, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada and senators Raffy Tulfo and Loren Legarda joined the fray. In over a quarter-century of journalism, I’ve seen many old truths upended, but the power of the Senate to direct national attention remains largely true. Even in a fragmented media landscape, the Senate retains enough political and media capital to set the public agenda; consider Pharmally, or the pastillas scam. As a counter-example, consider the House of Representatives; only a tiny fistful of House investigations end up shaping public opinion. If the larger political objective is to generate public support and momentum to finally stop the operation of POGOs in the Philippines, then the presence of additional senators can only be an advantage. Someone like Tulfo, who created an alternative information infrastructure based on delivering justice to ordinary citizens and then converted that into a political base, is especially welcome. And yet. The public appeal that returned Estrada to the Senate and placed Tulfo in its inner sanctum is built on a kind of political sensationalism, an appreciation of politics as theater, offering spectacle and, occasionally, even catharsis. I did not expect either Estrada or Tulfo to have undertaken the same preparations for the hearing as Hontiveros and Gatchalian, who have been at the POGO-as-scam-hub issue for much longer. Estrada tried to offer something new, but in a way that was teleserye-like. He said he had received information that a mayor from Pangasinan province was a) Mayor Guo’s lover or partner and b) he was the one actually running the POGO business in Tarlac. Guo denied the double insinuation. Estrada and Guo then engaged in an exchange, lasting several rounds, of sly accusation and repeated denial that the people gathered in the Senate session hall found amusing. Hontiveros had to admonish Guo, reminding her that it was “no laughing matter.” But it was entertainment – precisely of the kind we have come to expect from Estrada, who inherited his father’s gift. Tulfo did not offer any new information; instead, he contributed his theory of human psychology, an essential feature of his shows. At one point, he criticized Guo for failing to respond with what he called “but natural and human reaction.” At another point, refusing to accept that the issue of bloodlines and family relations was, as Guo said, a sensitive issue for her family, he said that Guo should have told off her father: “C’mon, Dad. Give me a break. Tell the truth. I deserve the truth, right?” To this cinematic cliche, Tulfo added a pronouncement. “Oh, you didn’t ask that? I don’t believe you.” Instead of entertainment, Tulfo offered severity of judgment, the kind of tough-talking therapy he uses on his shows. In a particularly revealing and sensational address, delivered in a mix of Filipino and English, he spoke to Guo directly: “Alam naman talaga namin kung sino ka, kaya lang (We already know who you are, but) it’s very hard for us right now to find out, that’s why we’re trying to get more information about who you really are, because we know, and everybody knows…and you know in your heart, na inconsistent ka (that you’re inconsistent) and you’re lying.” We have already judged you, even though we are still gathering the facts: That, plus entertainment value, sums up much of the current public discourse about the issue today. What should we, as a country, do about Mayor Alice Guo? Follow the often-flawed processes of accountability. (The Senate is not a court.) Follow the money. (Estrada made a really sensible suggestion, to invite Guo’s father to the Senate investigation. Perhaps he understands the role of a patriarch in a family with many interests.) Follow the law. The one thing we should stop following are our worst instincts. To tweak the famous quote from the other Pogo (the good one, the comic strip character): “We have met the enemy, and he is also us.”",0
7,John Nery,"Confusing one with the other allows disinformation peddlers like SMNI to claim rights they don’t possess. Here’s an anecdote from the 1990s. A friend’s brother was waiting for a ride outside a convenience store in a gasoline station when a pair of men pulled a knife on him. Suddenly, a female journalist rushed out of the store, brandished her press ID, and ran toward the group, shouting, “Media ‘to! Media ‘to” (I’m media)! The startled men scattered, leaving the brother unharmed. Much about this story seems incredible, even apocryphal. The woman rushing out to break up a crime in progress is only the most outstanding detail. But the fearless or even reckless use of press identification as a kind of shield hits different now, a decade and a half after the Ampatuan massacre and mere years after the Duterte presidency demonized the press wholesale. Recalling the story now, I am struck by how dated – that is to say how characteristic of a particular time – the encounter was. It couldn’t have happened during the martial law era; I doubt if it can happen these days. It strikes me now as a relic from the last 15 years of the 20th century and the first 10 of the 21st, a high point for what we now call legacy media. But in my retelling of this encounter, I used key terms interchangeably. I identified a journalist, I mentioned a press card, I recalled what the friend’s brother heard his rescuer shout about being a member of the media. In ordinary conversation, in polite banter, in informal settings, we interchange “journalism,” “press,” and “media” all the time. By and large, we mean the same thing, though we use different words. We understand; we are understood. But the journalism professor and media critic Jay Rosen, whom I have been following for almost three decades now (first on the internet and then on social media), makes a helpful distinction between the three terms. 
On February 22, 2021, in the depths of the pandemic, Rosen posted a 26-tweet thread that drew important distinctions (and that was itself a demonstration of the importance of making distinctions). One of the tweets read: Media, journalism, and the press are not interchangeable terms. Yet they are bound up with one another. Media is the attention industry Journalism is a social practice The press is a key institution in a democracy Journalists who work in the media carry forward ‘the press’. Rosen had previously made a distinction between audience (“people attending to a common object, typically a performance or spectacle”) and public (“people with different interests who live in the same space and share common problems”). He wrote: “An audience is not a public.” He also wrote: “I think of the media as an attention business, an industry whose product is audiences.” Set of practices. By media, then, he means the system or the business that underlies journalism (as well as other forms of audience-seeking content). By journalism, he means the current set of practices that journalists follow, to do their work. And by the press as institution, he means (and this is my understanding of the idea) a democratic office – that is, a public position of some authority and service. This was not the first time Rosen drew the distinctions. For instance, in a wide-ranging conversation in April 2012 with Ethan Zuckerberg, then with the Center for Civic Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he spoke of this “tripartite” nature in depth. (See Jay Rosen’s Three-Layer Journalism Cake, or watch the forum on the MIT website.) Starting with an ode to the political thinker Hannah Arendt, who was a master at making distinctions, Rosen prefaced his remarks by attempting to “pull apart” the three terms. “The practice of journalism, that’s one thing…the practice is what people do when they’re doing journalism.” “The second thing I want to talk about…is the underlying media system that the practice runs on.” By media, he said, he meant “the way that we produce information, distribute it, connect people to it, in society as a whole. That’s different than the practice of journalism.” Then he said: “The third thing that we should be able to pull apart is the institution of the press…. The press as an institution, first of all, is different from country to country. The reason it’s different from country to country is it’s very powerfully a product of law. If you don’t have laws establishing freedom of the press, you don’t have any press. You might have journalism, you might have a media system, but you don’t have a press because everything that happens is just a pale reflection of power. So until you have a public sphere, until you have a free press, until you have a legal system that secures the right of a free press, you can’t have a press.” Threefold distinctions. I have found these distinctions to be decidedly useful. I had a chance to address a small group of United Nations regional officials in Bangkok in 2023 together with other guests, and I used my time to explain these threefold distinctions, and to argue that they can be used to align or prioritize UN work or assistance in freedom-of-expression and access-to-information issues.
Do reporters or photographers have the right to organize themselves as a labor union? While this question has freedom-of-the-press implications, it is (I submit) eminently a media issue – that is, it relates to the business or system side, as do questions about reasonable wages or working hours. Should all journalists, including editors and producers, follow company policies regulating social media use? While this question has media-as-business implications, it is (I suggest) primarily a journalism issue – that is, it relates to the set of practices that journalists follow as they do their work.
Can a reporter be required by an executive agency to reveal the source of particularly damning allegations? While this question has journalism-as-a-practice implications, it is (I wager) firstly a free press issue. Journalists must be able to guarantee their anonymous sources, especially those fearing retaliation or even violence for the mere act of speaking out, that their identities will be protected. (Unlike, say, in the United States, the Philippines since 1946 has had the benefit of the Sotto Law protecting the duty of journalists to not reveal their sources.) In the case of SMNI, or Sonshine Media Network International, the broadcast network owned by Apollo Quiboloy’s religious group, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ or KOJC, the airing of an erroneous report or commentary about Speaker Martin Romualdez is not and should not be cause enough to suspend its operations temporarily or to revoke its congressional franchise permanently. That is to give too much consideration, and power, to one man. The wisdom of that venerable libel ruling from the Supreme Court, now over a hundred years old, remains true: “Men in public life may suffer under a hostile and an unjust accusation; the wound can be assuaged with the balm of a clear conscience.”
Suspending SMNI for running a false report on Romualdez is abuse of power – but against what? Against SMNI as a media entity, a business organized to meet the communication objectives of KOJC. A one-strike-and-you’re-out policy is prejudicial to the officers and staff of a company that, because of the nature of the business it is in, is vulnerable to mistakes. If this unfair standard protecting prickly politicians were applied to all media companies, none would be left standing. An anchor or commentator making a terrible error on air is a media issue, because the inevitable occasional error is a matter for the company’s Human Resources department. Policies are or should be in place to enjoin officers and staff not to broadcast an unverified story, to correct an erroneous claim, to sanction those who err, to prevent a recurrence. Pattern of lies. But what about repeated errors or, in the case of hosts Lorraine Badoy Partosa and Jefffey Celiz, a long-term pattern of outright lies and dangerous red-tagging? That situation may be covered by an HR policy too, but at its core it is a journalism issue. It is about the standards of care and responsibility that hosts of a news and commentary program should meet in doing their work. In other words, their record shows that Badoy-Partosa and Celiz have been doing the opposite of journalism: malicious propaganda. Under Section 4 of the law renewing the SMNI franchise (through its parent company), the willful and repeated airing of disinformation is an outright violation of SMNI’s contract with the public: “not use its stations or facilities…for the dissemination of deliberately false information or willful misrepresentation, to the detriment of the public interest.” The case filed by the Movement Against Disinformation with the National Telecommunications Commission against SMNI is based precisely on this reading. But isn’t the attempt to recall SMNI’s franchise an attack on the free press? What’s the difference between SMNI and ABS-CBN, whose franchise Congress refused to renew under pressure from Rodrigo Duterte? The difference is the purpose for which the networks are used and, because form follows function, the way the networks are organized. For all its shortcomings, ABS-CBN sought and continues to seek to serve the public (not its audiences alone) by reporting the whole picture. Despite its self-described status as a “nation-builder,” SMNI serves the needs of KOJC and its “Appointed Son of God.” Does this mean that no religious station can qualify as the press? Not at all. As Rosen argued: “Journalists who work in the media carry forward ‘the press.’” It is the work that serves the public (distinct from the audience). What separates SMNI (and also NET25 at particular junctures in history) from other religious stations is that it willingly serves as a platform for propaganda and disinformation. It does not serve as an office, an institution, of democracy.",0
8,John Nery,"The complicated but lasting legacy of Benedict XVI. Benedict XVI was a pope of paradoxes: the progressive peritus in Vatican II turned conservative gatekeeper of Council teaching, the extraordinarily gifted theologian who limited debate and silenced Catholic academics, above all the guardian of reform whose startling resignation reformed the Roman Catholic Church in the most fundamental way. His death at the age of 95 was truly the end of an era: He is the last of the popes (after John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II) directly involved in the Second Vatican Council, which convened from 1962 to 1965. Pope Francis, who was still a Jesuit scholastic at the time, was ordained a priest only in 1969. It is also possible that, if the pope who succeeds Pope Francis comes from the Global South again, Benedict may be the last European to serve as pope for some time to come. It is almost certain that the age of European dominance in the Church ended with Benedict’s death. Or to be more precise, the dominance of the thinking that understands the Church as a European institution, highlighted by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger’s second reason for choosing Benedict as his papal name—to honor the great St. Benedict, he said, who “evokes the Christian roots of Europe.” But another generation to which Benedict belongs, that of the men and women who were scandalized by the worldwide youth protests of 1968 and channeled their shock and concern into conservative movements in culture and politics and religion, remains influential. Old habits. In the immediate aftermath of his death, heightened emotions and old habits led to some exaggerated claims. Jean-Pierre Denis, publisher of the international editions of the La Croix newspaper, began his thoughtful appreciation of Benedict’s considerable intellectual legacy by describing him as “the last great European intellectual of the 20th century” – a remarkable claim, considering that other influential thinkers who made their mark in the last century, including one with whom Benedict engaged in an important dialogue, Jurgen Habermas, remain very much alive. It is also remarkable that a scholar of the highest quality served as pope; perhaps this is all that Denis meant, that Benedict was a theologian of great influence and consequence, who earned the esteem of other scholars even outside the discipline of theology. Michael Sean Winters, writing insightfully for the National Catholic Reporter, described Benedict’s decision to resign as “a great act of demystification” of the papal office (objectively true) but also as “an implicit, unspoken rebuke” to Pope, now Saint, John Paul II and his decision to remain in office “despite the incapacities of old age” (an interpretation, not a fact, which discounts Benedict’s own well-considered reason). It is possible to learn from the example of others without the learning necessarily being an act of criticism, much less a rebuke. It is true that Benedict did not want to wither in office as John Paul II did. As he himself said, in his Latin message announcing his resignation: “I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to advanced age, are no longer suitable for the proper exercise of the Petrine ministry.” But that was his own charism, or special gift: The humility to step aside. His predecessor’s was altogether different: The gift to suffer in public. As Benedict said in his homily at John Paul II’s funeral mass: “he increasingly entered into the communion of Christ’s sufferings … And in this very communion with the suffering Lord, tirelessly and with renewed intensity, he proclaimed the gospel, the mystery of that love which goes to the end.” Describing the resignation as a rebuke is an old habit of journalism, storifying conflict even when none exists. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, in a piece that characteristically offered an alternative history of the modern Church, rued that Benedict had “conducted a postpapacy of ambiguous gestures in response to a Vatican that had been delivered, by the mysteries of God’s providence, to his longtime foes.” This is an old habit of partisans and ideologues, framing reality as a constant struggle. But Douthat makes it sound as though Benedict’s retirement (at almost 10 years, longer than his papacy) was spent conducting these ambiguous gestures, instead of the almost uninterrupted life of prayer, contemplation – and unequivocal support for Pope Francis – that it mainly was. New media. As a journalist and a Catholic, I have always been fascinated by Benedict’s understanding of the way the media works. I understand that other people helped in the drafting of, say, his messages for World Communications Day, but comparing his messages with those of Pope Francis, to give an example, immediately shows that their thinking, their personalities, are reflected in the words they choose to release under their own name. Many of Benedict’s WCD messages centered on what he called the “digital continent,” the new “agora” created by digital technology. In 2009, he touched on an essential feature of social media networks like Facebook. “The concept of friendship has enjoyed a renewed prominence in the vocabulary of the new digital social networks that have emerged in the last few years … We should be careful … never to trivialize the concept or the experience of friendship.” In 2011, he noted that the new digital technologies “allow people to meet each other beyond the confines of space and of their own culture,” and then asked: “Who is my ‘neighbor’ in this new world?” In 2013, in his last message, he warned us: “Believers are increasingly aware that, unless the Good News is made known also in the digital world, it may be absent in the experience of many people for whom this existential space is important.” These insights deepen my disappointment at his alternative history of Vatican II, because it is confoundingly media-centric. In 2013, addressing Roman clergy, Benedict asserted that “there was the Council of the Fathers – the real Council – but there was also the Council of the media. It was almost a Council apart, and the world perceived the Council through the latter, through the media.” He added: “For the media, the Council was a political struggle, a power struggle between different trends int he Church.” But in fact, the Council was also a power struggle. As insider accounts prove, there was a “fierce battle” (Time’s Robert Blair Kaiser), a duel between the majority of the bishops and the reactionary Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani and his allies (peddling “papalist nonsense,” the peritus Yves Congar wrote in his diary). Sometimes, conflict does exist, and journalists do right to report on it. True legacy. Where does this paradoxical pope’s true legacy lie? While he has been criticized for his own handling of clerical sexual abuse cases when he was Archbishop of Munich, and continues to be criticized for his predecessor’s inaction, he acted decisively when he was head of the Congregation for Doctrine of the Faith. Thomas Reese, the Jesuit editor who was forced to resign from America magazine because of Benedict, wrote: “When his congregation was assigned abuse cases, the disciplinarian tendencies that led him to police theologians allowed him to cut through canonical niceties to expel hundreds, perhaps thousands, of abusers from the priesthood. His response was never perfect, but he did understand and deal with the problem quicker than any other Vatican official, including John Paul.” When he was pope, he removed an abusive religious founder from the ministry, and met with victims of abuse. His writings will continue to inspire many. His Introduction to Christianity, first published in 1968, remains a model of clarity; his many books, his three encyclicals, his Jesus trilogy (written when he was already pope), will continue to draw new readers (and old ones ready for rereading). He had the teacher’s gift for explaining even the most complicated of subjects. It should come as no surprise that he was the man in charge of John Paul’s project to publish the Catechism of the Catholic Church. “The fact that after an era of very strong theological and ecclesial debates and tensions, within a few years, that is, already by 1992, the work came to fruition in a largely convincing way has something miraculous about it,” wrote his former spokesman, Federico Lombardi SJ. Finally, his assertion of what he called the “hermeneutic of continuity and reform” will for a long time be heard differently, by those who prefer continuity and by those who seek reform of and in the Church, but his decision to resign the papacy, the first such instance in 600 years, could only have been possible because he followed that hermeneutic to the very end. He believed in both; he could resign because the Church allows reform, and he could resign in full confidence because the Church guarantees continuity. Truly a pope of paradoxes.",0
9,John Nery,"Now that she has passed the point of no return, which options will the Vice President choose? The one from 2001, or the one from 1957? The future of the Duterte political brand rests on the 2028 vote, and the run-up to it. Davao City itself remains the family stronghold. The former president’s second son Baste Duterte easily won election as mayor in 2022, his vote total more than eight times that of his closest challenger. Rep. Pulong Duterte, who cruised to victory with 15 times more votes than the next candidate, is poised to win a third term in 2025. And Vice President Sara Duterte herself won the vice-presidential contest in the city with 10% more votes than the mayor-elect; her vote total was 55 times that of the vice presidential candidate with the second highest number of votes. (Interestingly, the “people’s justice” constituency of Sen. Raffy Tulfo in Davao City was not enough to place him in the first 12 Senate slots; he came in 13th.) So mark the city safe for the Dutertes. But the rest of the country? Much will depend on what happens in the next few years: if the doomsday cult leader Apollo Quiboloy is extradited to the United States, if the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant against former president Rodrigo Duterte, if an armed encounter in the West Philippine Sea hardens Philippine public opinion against China, if the scandals involving Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators and scammy Pharmally come home to roost in Davao. It is in the best interest of the Duterte family and their allies, then, to ensure that VP Sara becomes the next president. That is how I understand her resignation from the Cabinet, and from the influential position of education secretary. (The Department of Education is the country’s largest bureaucracy.) She means to do all she can to prepare herself to succeed Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Four types of succession. But consider the vice presidents who succeeded to the presidency. History tells us there are at least four types of succession. The first path is the one contemplated by our constitutions: The president dies in office. Three found themselves traveling down this path: Sergio Osmeña succeeded Manuel Quezon in 1944, Elpidio Quirino succeeded Manuel Roxas in 1948, Carlos Garcia succeeded Ramon Magsaysay in 1957. The second trail is that blazed by Diosdado Macapagal, the first vice president elected from another party that was different from the president’s. Several months after the plane crash that claimed Magsaysay’s life, Garcia of the Nationalistas was elected president in his own right, in November 1957; for the first time, however, a president’s election mandate fell below a majority. Macapagal, because he was a Liberal, was shut out of the Cabinet. He spent the next four years essentially campaigning throughout the country, and handily beat Garcia for the presidency in 1961. The third path is the one that Joseph Estrada defined. While he belonged to a party different from that of Fidel Ramos, he accepted Ramos’ offer to include him in government through a presidential task force tailored to Estrada’s public persona as a tough-talking crimebuster. While he was not politically aligned with Ramos, he remained a popular part of the president’s official family until the end of their term. The fourth is that which unmade Estrada, and made Gloria Arroyo. A People-Powered uprising and the withdrawal of support from the military leadership forced Estrada out of office and installed Arroyo as president in 2001. Which path will VP Sara choose? Based on a reading of the many comments from Duterte supporters on social media, it seems that a good number would favor what I would call the Arroyo option. I do not mean to suggest that Gloria Arroyo, then the vice president, worked actively behind the scenes in early 2001 to undermine President Estrada; I only mean to say that the idea, held by quite a number of supporters of both the former president and his daughter, that Marcos Jr. can be forced to resign and that Sara Duterte can then replace him, is not fiction but rather fantasy fed on the events of 2001. That’s the underlying scenario behind former speaker Pantaleon Alvarez’s seditious appeal to the military to withdraw its support from President Marcos Jr. It’s a scenario nourished on regret and resentment, based on the (correct) assumption that he would not have been elected if he had not teamed up with Duterte. You can sense this skewed theme of false nostalgia run through the comments like an electric current: “She should have been president all along.” But can the Vice President and her allies engineer the ouster of another Marcos? This seems unlikely, if only because the Vice President’s father showed exactly how powerful the presidency is, despite the additional safeguards built into the 1987 Constitution. If he can brazen it out (the Rodrigo Duterte legacy), a president can outlast any rival. In other words, the moral standards or the public virtues we naturally expect of any president are not hard-wired into the system; a president acting exactly like Rodrigo Duterte can throw all that aside, and he will get away with it. Force the Supreme Court to impeach a chief justice without the benefit of impeachment, detain an incumbent senator for almost her entire term on trumped-up charges, impose martial law in Mindanao without meeting constitutional requirements, threaten opponents with mythical narco-lists and lethal red tags, demonize journalists, and so on, ad nauseam. Does Marcos Jr. have the appetite for such a political war of attrition? That remains to be seen, but it is important to remember the lesson we learned from Duterte: The presidency has the capacity to wage that kind of war. Going Macapagal. A more realistic reading of the situation suggests that VP Sara will likely follow the example of Cong Dadong, the “poor boy from Lubao,” who is not coincidentally the father of her close political ally, former president and former speaker Gloria Arroyo. Sara resigned to campaign full time for the presidency. She is now unburdened of the responsibilities of education secretary, for which she was never really qualified in the first place. The same day she resigned, the other main news story about Philippine education was yet more confirmation of its dismal state: In the 2022 cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA, the Philippines ranked in the bottom four in the world in “creative thinking.” This is the sort of news that will haunt any education secretary thinking of a presidential run; by the time VP Sara runs for the presidency in 2028, she would have distanced herself enough from such depressing statistics. (And if the work of the Second Congressional Commission on Education actually bears fruit by then, she can point to her participation, non-consequential but real, in the commission’s initial stages.) She is now free from the need to defend any policy of the Marcos Jr. administration, or at least to keep silent, and free to criticize it on the issues that matter most to the Dutertes and their allies: engagement with the ICC, defense of the West Philippine Sea, peace talks with the communist insurgency. She is now at liberty to test the one message of her father’s that never resonated with the public, the one theme he couldn’t sell: that our future lies in a closer alliance with Beijing. Coming out this early, and this unequivocally, carries a serious risk. If a somewhat cloying reticence propelled her to the top of the pre-election surveys before allying with Marcos Jr., how will undisguised ambition affect her standings? That calls for all kinds of creative thinking.",0
10,John Nery,"The communist insurgency is at its weakest. Counter-intuitively, now is the best time for both sides to resume peace talks and reach a peace deal. A new report by the International Crisis Group published in April concludes that the “Maoist insurgency in the Philippines is at its lowest ebb in decades.” From a high of 25,000 armed regulars in the last years of the Marcos regime, the number of rebels is down to somewhere between 1,200 and 2000 – roughly speaking, close to the same number when the first President Marcos used the then-new insurgency as a pretext for imposing martial rule in 1972. The insurgency is hampered by serious organizational challenges, including “perhaps the most severe leadership crisis in its history” (provoked not only by the death of its founder but also by “the killing [by the Philippine military] of several high-ranking commanders over the last three years”); a reduction in revenues generated from so-called revolutionary taxation (because of the loss of territory and “the arrest of financial operatives”); and internal confusion (“differences among cadres regarding the movement’s political and military direction”). These and other crises can be seen reflected, even without the benefit of context, in the message the Communist Party of the Philippines published to mark its 55th anniversary. Without reference to the combination of military pressure and development outreach that the government has been leveling against the insurgency, the message may read as yet another (though still remarkably candid) exercise in the revolutionary discipline of “criticism and self-criticism.” But read in the context of the rebellion’s continuing loss of leaders, fighters, base areas, resources, and informal support structures, these passages from the December 26, 2023, message confirm that the movement is, in fact, in bad shape. The message recognized that “not a few guerrilla fronts of the [New Peoples Army] stagnated and got stuck for a long time at the old level.” The cause, however, was identified as “some Party leaders,” who “self-constricted the NPA to its reliable guerrilla base areas and mountain encampments, limiting the scope or range of military and political initiative of the Party and NPA. Self-constriction goes against the need for guerrilla units to constantly move forward and advance, and to be always on offensive footing. Reliable guerrilla base areas were eventually reduced to a few ‘favorite’ or ‘comfort zone’ barrios, communities or mountain encampments with easy access to mass support, supply lines or communication facilities.” Military conservatism. The message developed its argument with even more candor: “Self-constriction and loss of initiative leads to military conservatism, as points from which the NPA can hit the enemy became limited or inaccessible. Other concomitant problems that arise include gathering intelligence, sources of supply, communications, and so on. The NPA could not readily carry out an ambush at the highway because its main forces are encamped in the interior areas. Mounting raids, ambushes, and other basic tactical offensives became increasingly cumbersome and time-consuming. They became content with attrition tactical offensives (harassment, sanctions and so on) and lost sight of the need to mount sustained annihilation or basic tactical offensives as the principal component of our strategy to weaken the enemy part by part and steadily strengthen the people’s army. “In a significant number of guerrilla fronts which had company-sized or multiple-platoon-sized forces, some Party leaders became complacent and self-assured. There were cases of over concentration of forces in some regions or sub-regions, where two or more guerrilla companies are brought together in a mountain encampment over extended periods of several months, to conduct trainings, education courses, prolonged meetings or to await execution of an ill-planned offensive, leaving less [sic] forces and less time for mass work. These prolonged encampments caused a heavy strain on the organized masses and militia forces who have to work hard to keep the supply lines running. These also cause guerrilla discipline to slacken and ‘civilianize’ guerrilla forces. Some NPA units have encountered problems of drinking among guerrilla fighters.” And so on, in this vein. The Crisis Group report characterized the CPP as “mindful of these challenges,” and summarized the message of December 2023 (and that of March 2024 too) as a call to “galvanize the movement” and “reinvigorate political and logical education for cadres and combatants.” Peace talks. Does it make strategic sense for the Philippine government to restart peace talks with the CPP-NPA and its National Democratic Front? The joint announcement last November of an agreement to resume peace negotiations was a real surprise – and was met with a mix of skepticism and hope. The skeptical response raised suspicions about political maneuvering ahead of the 2025 midterm elections; when Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ran again for the Senate in 2010, he was on the same slate as Bayan Muna’s Satur Ocampo and Gabriela’s Liza Masa. The hopeful stance recognized that one of the administration’s signatories of the Joint Statement for Peace was Special Adviser to the President Anton Lagdameo, President Marcos’ closest friend. But if the insurgency is at its weakest, why even attempt to strike a peace deal? Shouldn’t the government continue its current campaign mixing military pressure and development outreach until the last base area is recovered, the last guerrilla front overrun? It has already been about a decade since the national security establishment under the second Aquino administration came to the conclusion that the communist insurgency was no longer the country’s main national-security threat. The pivot to external defense or territorial defense operations (TDO) under the second Marcos administration formalizes the downgrading of the insurgency. Peace negotiations will help ease the pivot to external defense. That is the first reason why the Marcos administration should return to the negotiating table. The second reason is the law of diminishing returns; the counter-insurgency campaign that has helped reduce the size of the NPA by about half, since Rodrigo Duterte came to power, may have already reached its optimal phase. Besides, the kind of justification often offered by those who would like the current campaign to continue is very much along the lines of “crushing” the rebellion. The rebels are on the run, why stop hot pursuit? Because history’s lesson is clear. According to “Paths to Victory,” the 2013 RAND Corporation study of 71 insurgencies (updated from its influential 2010 study of 30 insurgencies, titled “Victory Has a Thousand Fathers”), the so-called “iron fist” path succeeds “only 32 percent of the time,” while its opposite approach, the so-called motive-focused path, succeeds 73 percent of the time. The iron fist approach to counterinsurgency (COIN) focuses primarily on “eliminating the insurgent threat,” while the motive path addresses “the motives for beginning and sustaining the insurgency.” In other words, the iron fist seeks to hammer the insurgents to oblivion, while the motive-focused approach resolves the conditions that gave rise to and supplies the insurgency. And the lesson from the history of insurgency from 1944 to 2010 is that the COIN odds do not favor the use of force alone. To quote the 2013 study: “The importance of reducing insurgents’ tangible support is the center-most finding of this research. Successful COIN forces reduce not only the active insurgents but also the support that fuels the insurgency.” But the Philippine Army, by far the largest of the services, has more invested in continuing the counterinsurgency campaign than any other institution; it is, hyperbolically, the only thing they know. They (and the Duterte political alliance) may stand in the way. Weaker position. Does it make strategic sense for the communist insurgency to enter into peace talks? As the scattered leadership must be only too aware, they will be returning to the negotiating table with a much weaker position. But they do own a conspicuous advantage: They offer the second President Marcos the historic opportunity of ending the insurgency that started under the first President Marcos. If the Marcos family were serious about rehabilitating their family name, concluding real peace with the communist rebels would rank high among the pathways to rehabilitation – not as high as paying their billion-peso tax arrears or returning their ill-gotten wealth, but high enough to cement their new reputation in Western capitals. But peace talks may also result in the suspension of red-tagging and red-baiting by government and military officials (the provocative actions of Duterte supporters is a different problem altogether), and may create the momentum necessary to review and improve the work of the task force overseeing the government’s COIN campaign. Not the abolition that UN Special Rapporteur Irene Kahn had strongly recommended (that looks outside the realm of political probability), but at least a change that renders it more community-oriented, more representative, more civilian. (The Crisis Group makes the same recommendations.) Time to talk peace again.",0
11,Iris Gonzales,"Inside Bangladesh, it’s called the Gen Z revolution as young students from Dhaka University began protesting last month to demand an end to the government’s jobs quota system.

The system, according to a CNN report on the Bangladesh crisis, reserves 30 percent of civil service posts for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.

“Many of the country’s contemporary political elite are related to that generation – including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.”

Following days of protests which had turned bloody, the 76-year-old Prime Minister Hasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter to India.

Hasina’s sudden exit ends 15 years in power, which were marred by dissent because her government, according to critics and human rights organizations, stifled civil liberties.

Amid joblessness, high inflation in the post-pandemic era and the growing curtailment of freedom, protestors demanded change.

Ironically, Hasina led a democratic uprising against military rule in 1990. Now she has found herself in the same situation but at the other end of the uprising.

It was a long time coming. It was not a revolution that happened overnight.

Prior to the July 1 protest, critics and human rights organizations have already expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, harassment of the media and opposition figures, crackdown on freedom of expression online as well as arbitrary detention and torture in Bangladesh.

Tipping point
This was not the first time that protests hounded Hasina’s government even as she managed to survive previous demonstrations.

The recent protests, however, were different as police shot and killed the young dissidents in full view of their peers.

This seemed to be the tipping point. Protestors could no longer be stopped, not even by the threat of being killed by security forces.

“Driving the anger was high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it slowed in the post-pandemic era and is beset with high inflation and depleted foreign currency reserves. In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education,” according to CNN.

This could be the first major successful Gen Z revolution in world history, said Sabrina Karim, associate professor of government at Cornell University, who specializes in the study of political violence, as quoted by CNN.

People Power I
The Philippines is no stranger to uprisings.

In 1986, we inspired the world with the historic bloodless People Power revolt which toppled Ferdinand Marcos Sr.

Whether in the Philippines or in Bangladesh, however, the challenge is how to protect the freedoms we’ve fought for and successfully won.

The challenge is to fulfill that promise of change that protests and revolutions strived to usher in.

Leaders of change must make sure that they are indeed capable of becoming the change they want to see in their country; that they wouldn’t just turn into the next monster or ogre they successfully slayed and that they wouldn’t end up being corrupted by the system they vehemently opposed and tried to change.

Otherwise, it will just be a cycle of boom and bust; of authoritarian rule and revolutions; of protests and military rule or, in our case, of yellows and reds; of Marcos and Aquinos; or of Marcos and Dutertes.

Look what happened to us. We toppled a dictator and showed the world how it was done only to elect another Marcos into power more than three decades later.

Ironically, some of those who protested against then president Marcos Sr. back then are now part of the government of President Marcos Jr.

One cannot blame them, however. Or the masses. Perhaps for them, nothing really changed after the 1986 People Power Revolution.

We are unique in this sense because it seems we never really learn our lessons. History just keeps repeating itself, no matter how absurd a cycle that is.

One culprit I see here is corruption.

Corruption has been around for thousands of years. Shakespeare’s plays showed vignettes of corruption, while Dante supposedly placed bribers in the deepest parts of Hell, according to the International Monetary Fund’s working paper on corruption published in 1998.

And yet, it doesn’t seem to end.

After a new candidate or a new system is in place, the initial jubilation soon fades as constituents realize that the same old system or the same old trapo is back.

In the Philippines, it’s even getting worse, especially in local government units where corruption has become so deeply entrenched.

Pay offs or grease money have gone up by 30 to 50 percent, attest some businessmen; some local chieftains even offer “bespoke pay-offs packages” to entrepreneurs who want to set up shop in their locality, depending on their capacity to pay and their needs.

Local chieftains, like lawmakers, also have their own contractors which they require businessmen to hire.

Anti-corruption bodies, including the Anti-Red Tape Authority, must look into these reports to eradicate corruption in the different branches of our government.

Revolutions can only lead to lasting changes if they topple not just flawed leaders but corrupt systems as well.

This is a lesson that Gen Z Bangladeshis must also keep in mind now that they have removed their leader from power.

Otherwise, it’s just going to be the same old story.",0
12,Iris Gonzales,"Curtains close. Kisses stop. Love stories end.

Indeed, some things in life are fleeting and ephemeral. That’s just the way it is. There’s even an old adage that says all good things come to an end.

Once in a while, however, life surprises us with something so great that it lingers and lives on in our hearts. Forever.

Such is the music of the legendary rock band Eraserheads, the kind that resonated – and continues to resonate – with generations and generations of Filipinos. Their songs were always someone's anthem and gospel truth; inspiration or palliative; a curse even but always an impetus to move and act.

It’s no surprise therefore that on Tuesday, Aug. 20, members of the band – Marcus Adoro, Ely Buendia, Raimund Marasigan and Buddy Zabala – returned to their Alma Mater, the University of the Philippines, to receive the prestigious Gawad Oblation Award, the highest distinction that the university can bestow.

Says UP president Angelo Jimenez in his welcome remarks: “The Gawad Oblation is a symbol of our deep gratitude for that extraordinary service rendered with or in our name. In the name of UP.”

It’s no exaggeration, he adds, that the Eraserheads “are a pivotal force in the history of original Pilipino music.”

“The Eraserheads helped define the music, memories and identity of a generation, no less.”

They also humanized a generation during a very very divisive period in the history of our country by asserting individuality, president Jimenez also says.

For the band members who all studied in UP Diliman, it was a full circle moment of sorts. The university, they said, was the foundation for their voice, art and music.

In their acceptance speeches, the Eraserheads said it was in UP where they tasted and experienced real freedom. “Kalayaan pumili at maghayag, kalayaan sundin at kalayaan pakingan ang sariling himig,” said Marcus.

Raimund thanked his parents who supported him even if he didn’t get to bring home a diploma, drawing laughter from the crowd. Buddy, too, thanked those who supported the band throughout their journey.

Ely recalled how music saved him from a sure failing grade in Spanish. “Singko,” says the Eheads vocalist in an exaggerated Spanish accent, drawing more laughter from the crowd.

“I begged my professor for a passing grade. And he asked me: Do you have anything that would make me consider passing you? Anything at all?

Ely told his professor:

Well I can write a song and so I gave him a demo cassette of Pare ko and prayed.

The next day, to his pleasant surprise, his professor in Spanish told him that he passed.

This experience taught Ely two things.

“One is that my professor could understand Tagalog and that two, from that point on, that music can get me through anything in life.”

A year later in Kalayaan, Ely found three people who also had his struggles and shared his dream.

The rest, as they say, is history.

For the crowd that descended into the glittering Executive House for the Gawad Oblation awarding ceremony, it was a great honor and delight to bear witness to such a momentous occasion.

President Jimenez invited me to cover the event but there at that moment, I could barely cover. I was just taking it all in with wide-eyed awe and a full heart, listening, as a huge fan, to their story.

For how could I not? It was a band that accompanied my generation in the murky years of our lives – from teenage to adulthood, those years of first loves and first heartbreaks, first defeats and first triumphs.

But for the first time, I was not watching them perform. I was listening to their stories about their UP days.

What they said about UP being a bastion of freedom and an abode to find your voice and pursue your passion is perhaps true for every UP student and alumni.

Most Distinguished Alumnus
Days before, in a separate but equally festive awarding ceremony for the UP Alumni Association awardees, tycoon Isidro “Sid” Consunji shared a similar story as a student after he was hailed as this year’s Most Distinguished Alumnus of UP.

Sid described himself as an ordinary engineering student but highlighted the fact that he also learned a lot from the time he spent in UP – outside its classrooms.

“I spent more time outside the classroom than inside, being active in Beta Epsilon Fraternity and the Association of Civil Engineering Students,” said the DMCI Holdings chairman who led this year’s roster of distinguished awardees.

I, too, was at the UPAA event, together with my family as we received the Multigenerational Alumni Family Award given to us.

On the sidelines of the event, Sid or IAC, as he is known in the business community, asked me where I get my inspiration to write my stories. In jest, I pointed to the Macallan on his table, saying it’s my poison and inspiration.

But in reality, as I stood there at both awarding ceremonies, I was reminded of the fact that its in UP indeed where I really learned to dream and pursue the things that inspire me.

As Ely Buendia said, “UP shaped not only our minds but also our souls.”

And from the others who came before us, our professors and fellow alumni included, we found the courage to carry on.

The Eraserheads and their songs, for instance, are vivid reminders of making it from one point to the next, of surviving the hardest of times and eventually thriving with a smile.",0
13,Iris Gonzales,"The Marcos administration can’t pop the champagne just yet even as Filipinos cheered the President’s big pronouncement during his State of the Nation Address, ordering a total ban on the Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs).

Now, his administration needs to do a lot of cleaning up and serious work as part of the post-POGO exit plan.

For one, the government would have to make up for the losses in revenue and business activities from the POGO exit – however insignificant our authorities deem this to be.

Economic managers said the costs of POGO far outweigh the benefits. Still, our taxman would need to find alternative sources of revenue to make up for what would be lost from the POGO industry’s exit from the country.

This is especially urgent with slower fiscal consolidation hounding the Marcos administration now and in the years to come.

Revenue
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), for instance, is now looking at taxing online sellers to raise additional revenue. According to its plan, merchants or sellers in online platforms are now subject to withholding tax effective last month.

BIR’s Revenue Regulation 16-2023 states that one-half of the gross remittances of e-marketplace operations and digital financial services providers to the sellers or merchants for goods or services shall now be subject to a one percent creditable withholding tax.

BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. stresses that this is not a new tax but merely including the sector in the withholding tax system.

It’s not yet clear how much the BIR expects to collect from this sector but with the proliferation of online sellers, it must be significant.

Will this make up for the taxes collected from POGOs? We’ll have to wait and see.

Taxes collected from POGOs more than doubled to almost P10.3 billion last year although still below the expected P32 billion when the Duterte administration passed the POGO Law in 2021.

From January to May this year, BIR data showed that taxes from POGOs already reached P14 billion – consisting of income, franchise, withholding, documentary and other taxes. This does not yet included license fees and share of the government in gaming revenues.

Will the BIR’s plan to tax online merchants yield billions in taxes, too? As I said, we’ll have to wait and see.

Additionally, the government would have to find new sources to plug the revenue losses that would inevitably appear in the trail of the POGO exit if only to fully realize the benefits of banning the industry.

Office market
Colliers also said the POGO ban is expected to push office vacancy rate to 22 percent by the end of the year from 19.3 percent in 2023. That’s a breach of the 20 percent level.

Thus, Colliers said real estate owners should make strategic adjustments to spaces previously tenanted by POGOs to cushion the impact of the industry’s exit from Metro Manila’s office market.

Colliers said POGOs occupied about 489,000 square meters of office space in Metro Manila as of end-June, or about 3.5 percent of the total office stock, as The STAR’s Richmond Mercurio reported last week.

In the office market universe, this is not that huge, considering that it represents only 3.5 percent of the inventory but whether we like it or not, this would still be significant enough to influence rental rates and related businesses.

Against this backdrop, Colliers said landlords, particularly those with high exposure to POGO tenants, should consider implementing various strategic adjustments.

“These include providing commercial concessions such as lower base rents, tenant improvement allowances and rent-free fit-out periods to make space more marketable to clients,” Colliers said.

Indirect benefits
There are other indirect benefits derived from the POGO sector, as the Department of Finance pointed out. These include compensation to laborers whose disposable income is spent on goods and services that generate economic activities.

DOF estimates the direct and indirect benefits of POGOs amount to roughly P166.49 billion a year.

But as reported by our public finance reporter Louise Maureen Simeon, the DOF’s cost-benefit analysis shows that the costs of POGOs are higher at P265.7 billion.

A huge part of this comes from supposed foregone revenues from investments and tourism due to the negative picture associated with criminal activities of illegal POGOs.

And this is where the Marcos administration needs to do a lot of cleaning up.

Simply banning POGOs does not necessarily mean that criminals and syndicates operating in the Philippines’ labyrinthine underworld will disappear or retire.

Our authorities must seriously investigate and bring to justice perpetrators of money laundering, peddlers of fake birth certificates and possibly, human traffickers. Otherwise such harmful and unspeakable acts will continue to hound us even after the POGO ban.

As what usually happens, syndicates behind organized crime may just lie low for a while until the spotlight dims; they would then reinvent themselves when the dust clears and continue perpetrating their crimes.

More importantly, authorities must keep an eye on illegal operators after the ban. E-sabong, jueteng and other similar activities have long been banned but have they really been fully eradicated?

Industry sources say otherwise.

Thus, authorities must pursue cases against perpetrators of crimes and their coddlers in high places.

Along with these efforts, the government must rid itself of bureaucratic red tape and corruption.

Only then can we send a message to legitimate investors that the Philippines is now a safe and friendly place to do business.

14,Iris Gonzales,"My late grandfather Jorge A. Gonzales, an outstanding individual who lived through World War II, put up a small fleet of jeepneys which served the route between Cubao and the University of the Philippines-Diliman campus.

He did this to help students coming from the Cubao area get to their classes on time.

My grandfather was a UP alumnus so he knew the need for transportation to and from the sprawling campus. When he graduated from the UP College of Law, he went on to practice law but at the same time, put up small businesses, including a barbershop and that fleet of jeepneys.

It complemented the UP Ikot route, which in turn was put up by the pioneer of the UP Ikot, Lolo Neong Odoy, so that students don’t have to walk long distances in between colleges in the 493-hectare campus.

This was during the postbellum era of the late 40s and early 50s, a time of rebuilding and recovering, of standing and helping each other rise from the devastating and paralyzing effects of the Second World War.

Back then, the jeepneys served the citizens well. The jeeps were a surplus from wartime and were sold and resold when the Americans left, paving the way for cheap public transportation for Filipinos.

Fast forward to today and we’re now on the way to phasing out jeepneys.

Is it a wise move?
Perhaps even my grandfather would agree that the jeepney, while it was fit for our roads during the postwar era and in the few decades after, is no longer the best public transportation we can offer Filipino commuters in this day and age. These 5,000-kilogram machines have become outmoded, what with all the changes that came with the times.

Our roads have become too crowded for the jeepneys and our streets too polluted for commuters to endure long rides in an open and exposed vehicle such as the jeepney.

As we develop, we really should provide Filipino commuters better but still affordable mobility options. These include other types of vehicles.

Had the government supported the jeepney manufacturers early on, we wouldn’t be taking this long to modernize our jeepneys. They could have evolved into producers of other types of vehicles under a brand that is truly Filipino. They could have updated the jeepneys to fit with the changing times. But they were always on their own.

But that’s water under the bridge now.

At present, the focus is to push through with PUV modernization.

I believe it’s about time this happens but of course it should not come at the expense of the drivers and other stakeholders who rely on the jeepneys to earn a living.

Transportation Secretary Jaime “JJB” Bautista has submitted a 100-page letter to Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero regarding the suspension of the Public Transportation Modernization Program (PTMP).

This came after senators said they would push for the suspension of the program.

Responding to the different points raised against the program, Sec. JJB stressed that the PTMP does not require PUV operators and drivers to immediately purchase modern PUVs upon consolidation. Instead, PUV modernization will occur gradually over the next three to four years after the consolidation deadline.

“We also want to assure the Senate committee that PNS and greenhouse gas emission-compliant modern jeepney units available on the market are not limited to foreign and imported manufacturers. In fact, modern jeepney units are also produced by well-known local manufacturers,” Bautista said in his letter dated July 29, 2024.

“The DOTr also remains committed to preserving the iconic design of our traditional jeepneys and encourages all local manufacturers and importers of PUVs to emulate the artistic design of traditional PUJs,” he also said.

This measure, Sec. Bautista said, aims to preserve the country’s cultural heritage while adhering to the relevant enforceable PNS or Philippine National Standards.

In his letter, the DOTr chief also warned of the potential effects of suspending PTMP as follows:

• Stakeholder impact. Suspending PTMP at this stage of its implementation could disrupt services for many who depend on its benefits. This could undermine progress and damage relationships with stakeholders, particularly, given that a significant percentage thereof have already consolidated.

• Resource utilization. Further, significant resources have already been invested in developing and implementing the PTMP.

In 2024 alone, the government has already appropriated the amount of P1.6 billion for the program. As it was furthered by the (Senate) committee, the program’s utilization rate is already at 53 percent of the P7.5-billion budget from 2018 to 2024. Suspending the program now risks wasting these investments and incurring additional costs to reestablish similar initiatives in the future.

As of April 30, 2024, the franchise consolidation process has reached 83.38 percent with 159,862 out of the 1919,730 baseline units consolidated. In total, there are 6,090 consolidated routes for PUJs, UVEs (UV Express), minibuses and PUBs (public utility buses), data from DOTr also showed.

Ways forward
In conclusion, Sec. JJB said, “We respectfully beseech the Honorable Senate to consider the ongoing benefits and improvements of PTMP. A temporary suspension might not only halt the positive momentum of the program, but could also have unintended negative consequences.”

Every paradigm shift has its challenges. Not everyone will be happy but the goal is for the changes to benefit the majority and more importantly, for the benefits to outweigh the drawbacks.

15,Iris Gonzales,"It’s a day celebrated not just in Japan but in different parts of the world, hosted by Japanese embassies across the globe.

But here in our country, the celebration of the birthday of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan is always extra special because it combines the best of Japanese hospitality and the warmth of the Filipino, not to mention the gastronomic delight of traditional Japanese cuisine and good servings of polished sake, often prepared together by Japanese and Filipino chefs.

Friday night at the Ty-owned Grand Hyatt Manila was no exception as Ambassador Koshikawa Kazuhiko hosted the annual National Day Reception to celebrate the 64th birthday of His Majesty the Emperor.

Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin graced the event and led the toast in honor of “the health of His Majesty the Emperor, the continued peace and prosperity of the Japanese people and the lasting friendship between the Philippines and Japan.”

It was indeed an evening of friendship, with government officials, lawmakers, tycoons and friends of the Japanese embassy in Manila descending into the glittering ballroom of Grand Hyatt in Taguig, some as early as the sun set in the city.

It was a fitting venue to celebrate a milestone for Japan because, as we all know, the Ty Group has been consistently instrumental in strengthening our country’s ties with Japan through its partnerships with some of the sogo shoshas from the so-called Land of the Rising Sun.

Not surprisingly, the Ty brothers, Arthur and Alfred, dapper in their suits, were there that evening; you can be sure it’s really an important event when Arthur, who isn’t usually seen in big crowds, makes a rare public appearance.

In his speech, Amb. Koshikawa reflected on the dramatic growth of Japan-Philippine relations. He lauded the mutual visit of President Marcos to Japan and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s visit to the Philippines in 2023, emphasizing the significance of these actions in reaffirming friendly relations between the two countries and setting a course for the future.

Economic cooperation
The evening wouldn’t be complete without talking about economic cooperation, and Amb. Koshikawa did just that as he underscored Japan’s commitment to strong economic ties with the Philippines.

A testament to this, he said, are the Japan-backed important infrastructure projects such as the Metro Manila Subway, the North-South Commuter Railway, the Davao Bypass, as well as the Mindanao peace process.

He also raised the importance of security cooperation, mentioning the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) that is under negotiation between Japan and the Philippines and the Official Security Assistance (OSA). RAA is aimed at facilitating cooperation between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Japan Self-Defense Force while OSA is for the provision of coastal radar systems.

Hello Ja-Fun!
Amb. Koshikawa also happily reported that because of a post-pandemic resurgence of tourism, the number of Filipinos going to Japan reached a record high last year.

There were 622,268 Filipinos who went to Japan, exceeding the pre-pandemic figures of 613,114 recorded in 2019, according to data from the Japan National Tourism Organization.

VIPs who filled the stage for the toast included House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Charles John Brown.

Also spotted that night were former prime minister Cesar Virata, Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity Carlito Galvez and members of the diplomatic community.

Tycoons, businessmen and executives also took time out of their busy schedules to join the festivities. Aside from the Ty brothers, I also saw Cecilio Pedro, founder of Lamoiyan Corp., the company behind the popular Hapee toothpaste brand; Edgard Cabangon, chairman of ALC Group of Companies and Yoji Kawaguchi, president of Mitsukoshi Federal Retail Inc.

New Toyota Philippines prexy
Just as I was chatting with Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP) chairman Alfred Ty, whom I congratulated for Grand Hyatt’s successful hosting of the event that night and the official turnover of the TMP presidency, newly appointed TMP president Masando Hashimoto walks by.

At last, I had the opportunity to finally congratulate Hashimoto because I wasn’t able to talk to him during the turnover ceremony held in the same glittering ballroom just a few days ago.

Hashimoto assumed leadership from Atsuhiro Okamato, who in turn, described his tenure in the Philippines as his most memorable, what with the Pinatubo eruption and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Going back to the Friday’s Japan National Day celebration, there were many other notable guests but one who stood out was the indefatigable and energetic Ramon S. Ang or RSA who arrived just as the program was about to start.

In no time, RSA was swarmed by well-wishers – including a rival bidder – congratulating him for his recent victory in the Ninoy Aquino International Airport bidding.

But it was not only his NAIA win that earned him praises, but also for Gilas Pilipinas’ landslide win against Hong Kong in the recent FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers.

That night, everyone wanted a minute of RSA’s time and he gave it. He was really visibly happy with what seems to be an alignment of stars for San Miguel Corp., the diversified conglomerate that he leads.

Overall, Japan’s National Day reception in the Philippines was a lovely evening not just to celebrate the oldest monarchy in the world, but to mark the good friendship it has built with other countries, including ours, through the years.

I, too, offer my warmest felicitations to Japan on its special day.",0
16,Iris Gonzales,"This time of the year between Christmas and New Year is a Dead Week of sorts, when homes are a bit quiet compared to the frantic schedule the whole year round; cities are less crowded and some families are out on vacation.

Society is on a pause of sorts and people don’t really want to do much or accomplish anything, resigned to the fact that what’s done is done.

It’s also a good time to take stock of the year that would soon be over.

Now how can we talk about 2023 without discussing politics and how it took centerstage for the most part of the year?

While both camps are denying it to the high heavens, it’s obvious that the much touted UniTeam Alliance, the electoral alliance between the Marcos and Duterte camps, is now a thing of the past.

And we’re of course treated to a ringside view of the conflict, as gripping and as tense as a Manny Pacquiao boxing fight.

I say treated because, admit or not, here in our Republic of Marites, we love being spectators in our dirty political arena. If, as Marx said, religion is the opium of the masses, politics, no doubt, is the opiate of the rest of the population.

And as I said, what a gripping boxing match it has been or still is.

There’s the House of Representatives’ successful move to strip Vice President Sara Duterte’s offices of confidential funds.

Rody Duterte came to the rescue of his daughter Sara, saying with all certainty that the realignment was politically motivated and related to the 2028 presidential polls where President Marcos’ cousin and House Speaker Martin Romualdez and the Vice President are perceived as frontrunners.

And then there’s Sara Duterte recently criticizing President Marcos for reopening peace talks with communist rebels in what marks as her first major public rebuttal of the President and his administration’s policies.

And then there’s the move of the House against Sonshine Media Network International whose program hosts have used their platform to red-tag activists and some media organizations. I don’t agree with the revocation of the franchise but I agree that the network should be investigated for all the fake news and red-tagging it has unleashed. Changes must be implemented.

Silver lining
There is a silver lining in all these moves. At last, past actions of the Duterte administration are now being rectified.

Clearly, the Dutertes’ unparalleled arrogance was no match for the stars that aligned at the House. Suddenly progressive lawmakers and the powers-that-be have become strange bedfellows. Ah, welcome to our land of the bizarre.

Bad news is that this is happening largely because of politics and as I said earlier, policy changes that are motivated by politics may not really be sustainable.

It would have been better if accountability and justice were the primary motivations to correct misdeeds of past administrations.

My fearless forecast is this politicking will continue throughout the new year.

Social concerns
We can only hope our policymakers and lawmakers won’t be so distracted that they forget there are a lot of pressing social concerns – from the worsening crisis in education to low economic productivity to food security, not to mention a possible resurgence of COVID-19.

As the recent GlobalSource report by former central bank deputy governor Diwa Guinigundo and Wilhelmina Mañalac noted, the latest Business Expectations Survey showed that Philippine businesses remained modestly positive in their outlook for the current quarter compared to the previous quarter as measured through the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Confidence Index. The index was up by only 0.1 percentage point in Q4 2023 (35.9) compared to Q3 (35.8).

There is tempered optimism, no thanks to the negative effect of the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, inflation and higher interest rates.

Thus, next year could be an even more difficult year if the downside risks to the economy such as higher inflation and lack of jobs materialize.

GlobalSource has likewise warned: “We doubt whether the government has a solution to the prolonged El Niño dry spell next year using better rice production technology.”

“This is one of the tasks cut out for the new economic czar Frederick Go – to orchestrate the deployment of public policy to mitigate pressing social concerns, not the least of which is attaining food security within the context of sustained economic growth,” it also said.

There is so much to do indeed and I hope our uncanny politics does not get in the way.

There’s only the whole of 2024 to get as many critical reforms as possible done because by 2025, our politicos will be busy preparing for the midterm elections.

What I fervently hope to see are more actions, not early campaign photo-ops; more reforms and less politicking; more policy changes for the better and less graft and corruption; more jobs for Filipinos, not just investment pledges.

As it is now, this country’s institutions have been bastardized and co-opted by selfish and self-serving politicians and corrupted to the core.

But all is not lost.

Hope springs eternal, as I always say. This is etched in my heart like a tattoo because I believe in it as much as I believe in our country and our people’s full potential.

But we all need to believe in it and demand for the changes that we deserve so that someday soon, our beloved home country will finally be the great nation that it should be.",0
17,Iris Gonzales,"In today’s newsrooms, says tycoon Manuel V. “MVP” Pangilinan, the title of “editor” is perhaps the most inaccurate.

Why so? MVP argues:

Publishers publish, reporters report and journalists work on journals. One would think that all editors do is edit.

“But your jobs – as you know – are far more important, and much more intensive than marking up your writers’ drafts. You have perhaps the most crucial job of all – which is choosing what to focus on, and deciding what the news is,” he says.

Brave new world
This is particularly important, MVP says, as he recognized the existence of artificial intelligence and its curatorial influence on information via algorithms.

But this doesn’t mean the job of the editor has become obsolete, he says.

“In fact, you are all more valuable than ever before. In cyberspace where answers are available everywhere, you determine which questions are worth asking,” says the tycoon during a recent gathering of news editors organized by the MVP Group.

Perhaps MVP, the chairman and CEO of the many companies he leads, is also well aware that consumption has changed drastically.

The same is true in the news. The way people consume news today and the way news affects the world, have significantly changed.

As MVP says, it’s a time when what confronts us is something in the mold of English author Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel, Brave New World where, the tycoon notes, “people are flooded with so much information that it’s impossible to distinguish what’s important from what’s not.”

The greatest weapons against such a threat are news editors, MVP says.

It’s one of those times when MVP, whose sprawling business empire includes stakes – big or small – in media organizations, puts the spotlight on the people who sift through the dizzying avalanche of stories every single day and decide which ones would have the biggest impact on the lives of Filipinos.

KathNiel
Times indeed are changing. Who would have thought for instance that KathNiel fans would have a collective breakdown after Filipino celebrity couple Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla announced their split after 11 years of being young lovers on-screen and off-screen?

At least one local newspaper put it on the front page, perhaps to acknowledge this heartbreak of millions of Filipinos. Television news programs interrupted their regular hard news to announce the break-up. The Singapore Straits Times carried a story about it.

Were newspapers correct in giving so much prominence to the KathNiel breakup?

At best, it was a recognition that a great big part of the Filipino population were in tears.

Perhaps, sometimes, sifting through news isn’t always about looking for stories that would make people less hungry or more hungry. It’s also about recognizing stories that affect – momentarily or otherwise – the Filipino people’s soul, something AI can’t figure out just yet.

Perhaps, it’s no coincidence that MVP reminded us about Huxley’s Brave New World, which warned against a society devoid of deep connections that make us truly human and alive.

More imported meat from Brazil
Speaking of hard news and gut issues, some recent news from Brazil caught my attention.

Brazil, the world’s top chicken exporter and home to giant meatpackers, announced in early November that it was extending an avian flu-related national health emergency for another 180 days due to more detections of the virus.

The South American country has confirmed avian flu cases in wild birds as early as May 2023 and declared a health emergency a week later.

Just last Nov. 7, Brazil announced that it was extending the national health emergency, Reuters has reported.

Japan had imposed a temporary ban on Brazilian chicken products coming from Espirito Santo state in late June and from Santa Catarina, Brazil’s second largest producer and exporter of chicken, in mid-July.

Although Brazil said the highly infectious virus has not yet reached commercial flocks, it has 139 confirmed outbreaks of the disease, including in wild birds, subsistence poultry and mammals, the Reuters report also said.

Against this backdrop, I’m curious why the Philippines wants to pave the way for more meat imports from Brazil.

The South American country is seeking system-wide accreditation that will allow its establishments to export animals, meat and meat products to the Philippines.

Thus, in a special order last month, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said he is sending an inspection mission to Brazil for the accreditation of Brazilian foreign meat establishments.

Normally, this is just a standard procedure. When countries want to export meat and meat products to the Philippines, they need to apply for systemwide accreditation which would entail actual inspection of their animal health and safety standards.

But there are many factors at play here. Why do we want to bring in more meat imports at this time and from a country with confirmed cases of avian flu?

Brazil’s meat products such as beef, pork or chicken parts could directly compete with Filipino farmers who are already struggling.

As it is now, mechanically deboned meat or those used to make products such as sausage, nuggets, luncheon meat, etc. already enjoy a two-year, five percent tariff rate which exporters are currently enjoying. The Marcos administration has extended the lower tariffs to end-2024.

Imports help ensure the continued supply of food products in the country at affordable prices but as I’ve said before, we must also make sure that our local industries get enough support.",0
18,Iris Gonzales,"After more than a year and after several other names cropped up in the business grapevine, at last we finally have an agriculture secretary.

Newly appointed Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. will be racing against time because of the enormity of the work that needs to be done – from ensuring food security to addressing specific problems of our local industries.

This early, there are already some hiccups – expected of course – including the fact that he did not graduate from the University of Santo Tomas despite official documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying so. (Congratulations to campus journalists from The Varsitarian for putting the spotlight on this).

Hiccups aside, I hope he will be able to improve a sector that was once upon a time, our country’s pride, hope and source of economic growth.

It’s a challenging task for sure and one must be a bit crazy to accept the agriculture post especially in these hard times. But then again, sometimes the crazy are the ones who get things done. We’ll see about that.

My hope is that he would be open to huge changes in the present structure of the Department of Agriculture and work closely with people on the ground – the farmers, the fisherfolk, the local government units.

As I said before, the present structure of the agriculture department is from the top down wherein plans and programs emanate from the top with hardly any consultation from those on the ground and implemented in a one-size-fits all manner. This isn’t always effective because different regions have different problems.

Sec. Laurel can change this by working closely with the different LGUs because they are the ones who are in touch with the farmers. The farmers know and listen to the LGUs’ provincial agriculture and municipal officers, as former agriculture undersecretary Dr. Cristino “Resty” Collado pointed out.

This could help a lot in determining how to allocate food production budget, say the rice production budget, for example. Those in the top 10 rice producing regions should be prioritized while top performers can be rewarded with a higher budget from the DA.

Rice
In the food hierarchy, three major commodities must be tackled properly – rice, meat and sugar, as I said before.

Rice is top in the hierarchy, the mainstay in every Filipino meal.

Sec. Laurel would have to create an effective partnership with farmers to boost rice productivity. This, in turn, can be done with the DA and the different LGUs working together.

For example, the local chieftains can distribute seeds and fertilizer directly to the target. They can identify which areas need to be prioritized the most.

Pork, chicken

Next in the food hierarchy is pork. Whether we like it or not, healthy or otherwise, we are such a meat eating country.

Welcome to this lechon republic!

Indeed, meat products, mainly pork and chicken, are the usual food items that most Filipinos complement with rice.

Also, the price of pork is the lead barometer used to plan for family food budgets. Prices of poultry and fish follow when prices of pork go up.

Speaking of meat, we are also having problems with cheap imports.

Industry sources have said that a lot of meat products have been kept in cold storage facilities for months on end.

Normally, this is allowed but in recent months, there have been numerous reports of some of these meat products stored far too long and no longer fit for consumption yet are finding their way into stores and wet markets in the country without any information on their expiry or production dates.

The least the government can do is to make sure that every product sold to consumers is properly labeled.

Raids by the DA months ago and industry monitoring from local producers have shown that tubs and tubs of unbranded and spoiled chicken products are sold in some wet markets such as those in Bulacan and Caloocan.

There are even reports that a cold storage operator in northern Luzon buys imported meat products – some of which may be expired – and sells these goods to food kiosks selling chickens, dumplings, etc. This is a horror story, if true.

The DA must be vigilant and must look into these reports that’s been going around the industry.

Data from the Bureau of Animal Industry showed that the country bought 289.52 million kilograms of chicken overseas in the first eight months of the year, 35.4 percent higher compared to the 244.8 million a year ago.

Not surprisingly, our local meat producers are hurting.

Sugar
And then there’s the bitter situation surrounding our sugar industry, which is now on the brink of extinction due to neglect and our obsession with imports.

Importing goods of course is always the more convenient route because these goods are cheaper.

But there’s always the issue of smuggling and poor quality of imported food, especially meat products.

The different problems surrounding our top commodities point to a common solution and that is to increase local production. This is of course easier said than done and may not be the fastest solution.

But for the sake of our farmers, producers and for our own food security, we must do it.

How we get there under Sec. Laurel’s leadership remains to be seen. Would he be able to strike that delicate balance between ensuring affordable food prices and strengthening local production?

I hope we find out soon enough.",0
19,Iris Gonzales,"The P48-billion budget overrun reported by telco giant PLDT marks another chapter in its long, colorful and winding history – 94 years and counting.

It’s a major development for the country’s oldest and largest telecommunications giant and even PLDT chairman Manuel V. “MVP” Pangilinan’s arowana knows it.

MVP shared on Twitterverse on Monday that his arowana died, a death which feng shui believers consider a “noble sacrifice.”

Indeed, many believe that when an arowana dies, it is often a noble sacrifice that takes away the bad luck or misfortune that has befallen a household or perhaps a business.

“Probably absorbed all the angst of PLDT on our behalf,” MVP said.

Often called the “dragon fish” because its metallic coin-like scales undulate like the paper dragons we see during Chinese New Year, the arowana has spawned the belief that the fish brings good luck and prosperity. It’s no surprise it’s a favorite among Asian elite.

True or not, one thing is clear. Investors are waiting with bated breath for the result of PLDT’s internal investigation on the budget overrun.

Impairment
As I write this, PLDT is set to talk to investors and analysts. Reporters covering the beat are staking out. By the time this column comes out, PLDT may have already clarified the issues. It said last week that it has not uncovered fraudulent transactions or procurement anomalies.

Even MVP’s business rival Ramon “RSA” Ang, who knows the nature of a telco business, believes it was unlikely that the overrun was due to fraud.

It was not ‘mathematically possible’ to defraud a company of P48 billion, Ang said.

Instead, it may have been more of an impairment issue arising from some – and expensive – telco network equipment that may have been acquired but was not used as intended or did not deliver on its intended use. This might have been largely due to tech factors such as becoming obsolete or being no longer applicable in certain areas by the time the different types of equipment were delivered.

RSA noted that in the telco business, this can happen because there are many moving parts and technology changes in the wink of an eye. Thus, what may be applicable or needed today may no longer be useful tomorrow.

Another source said the P48 billion refers to equipment already in use that was not yet officially accepted. Thus it is not yet recorded in the books of PLDT. This means they aren’t depreciated yet in accounting terms.

The source said that “if you use the average life of ten years,” depreciation would have reduced the operating income by P4.8 billion a year and about P3.6 billion after tax.

Ambulance chasers
Ambulance chasers have already smelled blood. News from the US showed that US law firms are urging affected investors to file a complaint against the telco giant.

We will now have to wait and see what happens next, including the results of the inquiry of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Everyone is waiting with bated breath.

What is clear for now is that this development will certainly mark a major chapter in PLDT’s long, corporate history.

Philippine Airlines sees milestone profit year

Over at another company, Philippine Airlines, the country’s flag carrier, is reaping the benefits of the travel industry’s recovery.

PAL expects to record a milestone profit year for 2022, thanks to revenge travel.

In a recent chat, PAL president and COO Capt. Stanley Ng  said almost all routes are back to pre-pandemic levels except China, which only just started to ease COVID-19 related curbs.

For the third quarter of the year, PAL registered an operating income of P4.9 billion and comprehensive income of P4.2 billion.

This brought nine-month income to P11.5 billion and the comprehensive income to P8.3 billion, signifying the continuing resurgence of the Philippines’ only full-service network airline amid the ongoing recovery of air travel and tourism.

But Capt. Stanley said there’s still a lot of work to be done to sustain growth.

These include further improving PAL’s customer service, adding more flights and opening new routes.

PAL just opened a new route between Cebu and Baguio City last Dec. 16, marking PAL’s comeback to Baguio, the very first destination it served nearly 82 years ago.

“So we are happy to be flying back to where it all started,” Capt. Stanley said.

PAL to Europe
PAL may also return to Europe by 2025, “an aspirational target,” he said during our chat, just days after he arrived from Brussels where he joined President Marcos in a meeting with Brussels Airport CEO Arnaud Feist.

This happened at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-European Union (ASEAN-EU) Commemorative Summit last week.

Last mile
PAL wingwoman Cielo Villaluna also shared with me that PAL will soon have a last mile shipping service, which will be a game changer for the cargo industry and would be beneficial to Filipinos, especially in this age of speedy deliveries.

Things indeed are looking up for PAL but as Capt. Stanley said, the flag carrier still has a lot of room for improvement.

I’ve been on a few PAL flights recently and I have no issues. I even raved about the excellent in-flight food from Manila to New York but I continue to hear a lot of horror stories from other passengers – from lost baggage to delayed flights to the long wait for their bags at the conveyor belt.

May all these problems be resolved sooner than later so that Filipinos and visitors alike can truly enjoy traveling, whether for business or pleasure.",0
20,Iris Gonzales,"The sun is out, the storm has passed. The Paeng-induced bedlam has died down at least for now. It’s business as usual again at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), the country’s main gateway.

The past few days, however, a different kind of mayhem descended into the airport; of how a new general manager has been appointed, surprising NAIA insiders and the whole industry.

But as I write this piece on this sunny Monday morning, I’m told that it’s still business as usual at the airport after all, despite news of a new Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) general manager.

Transportation Secretary Jaime “JJB” Bautista also confirmed to me that it’s another day at work for MIAA general manager Cesar Chiong.

“It’s business as usual,” Sec. JJB said.

This is good news, some airport insiders said. Many of them are happy with GM Chiong’s leadership style.

“He is doing very well. Everyone is inspired to work. His style of management is that of the private sector,” one insider shared with me.

By private sector-like leadership style, they meant that GM Chiong is professional, listens to everyone and makes a decision based on what is best for all.

Sec. JJB said the same thing. Even members of the board of directors of MIAA have been actively participating in meetings now, just like in the boardrooms of private corporations, he said.

GM Chiong is a veteran aviation executive with at least 30 years experience with Philippine Airlines, Air Philippines and in San Miguel Corp. prior to joining the government, said Sec. JJB, who handpicked him for MIAA.

Reforms
He has been instituting reforms and has been going after those with unpaid financial obligations to the airport, insiders said. The money was meant to finance improvements such as in the different terminals and in digitizing airport processes.

These efforts may have ruffled some feathers who might have lobbied for leadership changes in MIAA, sources said.

Snake pit
This shouldn’t be the case, really. Serving in government shouldn’t feel like being in a snake pit and that you could lose your job any moment.

Unfortunately, it seems the most uncertain job positions these days – as uncertain as in Elon Musk’s Twitter – are in government.

How many ranking Palace officials have had to leave for unclear reasons the past months? Is this a reflection of the supposed power play among the different groups in this administration?

I heard there are eight power blocks surrounding the President. If true, they put the PNoy-era Samar and Balay rivalry to shame.

Gods of NAIA
On a serious note, I hope to see the continuation of reforms in our airports, especially in NAIA, the country’s most important gateway. If GM Chiong is seriously fixing the problems including weeding out money-making syndicates, then let this continue.

There are a lot of changes that need to be implemented to improve airport operations. Otherwise, we will continue to experience mayhem whenever there are calamities or extraordinary situations such as holidays, which are peak seasons for traveling.

GM Chiong has a lot more to do to improve airport operations. I wrote about the Paeng-related mess two weeks ago. Six years won’t be enough to implement lasting changes in the airport but if we keep changing the leadership in the middle of reforms, we would just be going around in circles.

Many of our longtime airport officials and rank-and-file workers are smart, hardworking and sincere civil servants. They deserve a competent leader.

Controversial positions such as airport GMs should never be politicized. In fact, anyone trying to reform our gateways – or any government agency for that matter – by weeding out money-making syndicates or the so-called Gods of NAIA should have the full backing of the President.

These syndicates have been getting their way for decades now. Isn’t this the reason why past private sector attempts to take over the operations and management of NAIA – even with the combined strength of seven of the country’s biggest conglomerates – never prospered?

At the end of the day, without improvements in our airports, it is the traveling public who will continue to suffer. More often than not, when we fly in and fly out, we experience chaos in our airports.

While fixing NAIA, we should also have a new and alternative gateway.

Bulacan Airport
Sec. JJB shared with me that during the weekend, he and his team also inspected the progress of the New Manila International Airport or the Bulacan International Airport of San Miguel Corp.

There’s been significant progress, says Sec. JJB, referring to the massive dredging works on the site of the airport and he is excited. I hope that indeed we will finally see a new and alternative gateway in the years to come. We needed a new airport yesterday.

Home
I dream to see the day when we can all pass through a gateway that is among the best in the world, one that is consistently efficient and excellent; one that is comfortable and convenient for each and every passenger and not just for Business Class or VIP travelers; one that will give us an enjoyable experience between flights; one that isn’t just business as usual but so much better.

The airport is that last thing we see when we depart and the first thing that welcomes us when we come home.

Passing through it shouldn’t feel like walking the gauntlet but should feel like a piece of home, as if we’re back in the warm embrace of a loved one.",0
21,Maria A. Ressa,"Those with power and money must choose. Ask yourselves these questions: Who are you? What do you stand for? What kind of world do you want in the next decade?'
The following speech was delivered by Rappler CEO Maria Ressa on Sunday, May 2, after receiving the 2021 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.

Thank you so much to UNESCO, the independent jury, the more than 80 press freedom and news organizations who have helped us hold the line. This is for Rappler and all Filipino journalists who – despite the increased risks just to be able to do our jobs – continue to hold power to account. It’s also a reflection of how the world looks at the Duterte administration today and the death by a thousand cuts of our democracy happening in front of our eyes.

I wish I were with you today in Namibia, but I’m in Manila, prevented from traveling by court order – which I continue to fight as State-led legal attacks are waged against me on multiple fronts. I also can’t travel because my nation is suffering the consequences of putting retired military generals in charge of a public health crisis – when political patronage and loyalty, not competence, is the metric of power.

This is a time when lies and incompetence kill.

In less than two years, the Philippine government filed 10 arrest warrants against me.

In 2017, government propagandists tried to trend the hashtag #ArrestMariaRessa. They failed, but they kept at it, and two years later, I was arrested – twice – in a little more than a month. They violated my rights when they prevented me from posting bail and detained me overnight. I suppose they wanted me to shake and feel their power.

To the budding dictators of this world, if you have to abuse your power to make you feel powerful, you’re not powerful – just abusive and small.

What I and other truth-tellers in the Philippines have lived through has given us firsthand experience of how the law and law enforcement have been turned against our people. Now more than ever, power and money rule.

In 2016, 4 months after Duterte became president, Rappler and I wrote investigative pieces showing you how the first casualty in our nation’s battle for truth is the number of people killed in our brutal drug war. That violence was facilitated and fueled by American social media companies. Based on big data analysis, we reported the networks that were manipulating us online, targeting and attacking truth-tellers, pounding to silence anyone challenging power, which created an extensive social media propaganda machine.

Five years ago, we demanded an end to impunity on two fronts: Duterte’s drug war and Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook. Today, it has only gotten worse – and Silicon Valley’s sins came home to roost on January 6 with mob violence on Capitol Hill.

What happens on social media doesn’t stay on social media.

Online violence leads to real world violence.

Since 2016, I have felt like Sisyphus and Cassandra combined, repeatedly warning that our dystopian present is your future. American biologist EO Wilson said it best: we’re facing paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology.

Social media, with its highly profitable micro targeting, has become a behavior modification system, and we are Pavlov’s dogs experimented on in real time – with disastrous consequences. Facebook is the world’s largest distributor of news, and yet studies have shown that lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and further than really boring facts. The social media platforms that deliver the facts to you are biased against facts, biased against journalists, biased against meaningful conversations. They are – by design – dividing us and radicalizing us. This is not a free speech issue. It’s not the fault of its users. These platforms are not merely mirroring humanity. They are making all of us our worst selves, creating emergent behavior that feeds on violence, fear, uncertainty, and enabling the rise of fascism.

Think of it like this.

Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without trust, we have no shared reality, and it becomes impossible to deal with our world’s existential problems: the coronavirus, climate, the atom bomb that exploded in our information ecosystem when journalists lost gatekeeping powers to technology companies. Tech abdicated responsibility for the public sphere and couldn’t seem to fathom that information is a public good.

Women, people of color, the LGBTQ, those already marginalized become even more vulnerable as you’ll see in the UNESCO report “The Chilling” whose lead author, ICFJ’s Julie Posetti, convinced me to speak up when my attacks began many years ago. Of course, there’s a cost to speaking truth to power.

On Christmas Eve two years ago, Amal Clooney sent me an email. Until then, no one had really had the time to go through the many ludicrous charges I’m facing and their penalties. Turns out I could go to jail for the rest of my life. By her last count – on paper – it was more than a hundred years in prison. So I dealt with the sinking feeling in my stomach – this is my lawyer telling me that, right? I took away a lesson: don’t open an email from Amal on Christmas Eve! Sometimes you just have to laugh.

Believe it or not, I’m lucky. When you’re the target of attacks you’re the only one who sees it all, but you can also see exactly how the tactics change. Knowledge is power. And because I spent two decades of my career outside the Philippines, the international community knows me, the quality of my work, my values, my work ethic.

So many others aren’t so lucky.

Like 35-year-old Ritchie Nepomuceno, who accused the police of extortion, torture, and rape. She was one of at least 3 Filipino women who filed charges against 11 policemen who they said held them inside a secret room at a police station. Less than two weeks ago on April 19, Ritchie was walking down the street when she was shot and killed.

Human rights activist Zara Alvarez and another colleague were set to testify against the government and the military. She went as far as asking for court protection, which was at first denied, and is still on appeal. Last August, she was walking home with her dinner – she had just bought it – when she was shot and killed. So was her colleague. No one is left to testify. I could go on.

Now let’s go to the journalists.

Frenchie Mae Cumpio, still in jail, celebrated her 22nd birthday in prison. Arrested and jailed more than a year ago, it is a familiar tactic: get an arrest warrant; do a raid; then charge with possession of illegal firearms and explosives, a non-bailable offense.

That’s also what happened to Lady Ann Salem, another young journalist. Arrested last December, Salem said the police planted evidence in her apartment, but another judge voided her arrest warrant. It still took time before she was released, forcing her to spend 3 months in prison during a pandemic. 

Because she’s a journalist.

It’s not a coincidence that these victims are women. This February, Senator Leila de Lima, whom Amnesty International calls a prisoner of conscience, began her 5th year in prison. She calls it lawfare – when law is used as a weapon to silence anyone questioning power. The cuts to democracy are bleeding. They’re overwhelming and can’t be ignored.

Last year, two days, just two days after World Press Freedom Day, Filipino lawmakers, nudged by President Duterte, shut down ABS-CBN, once our largest broadcasting network, our largest news group, also headed by a female journalist. Thousands lost their jobs.

Around the same time that Hong Kong passed its draconian security law, the Philippines passed an anti-terror law that sparked 37 petitions at the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional. Under that law, anyone some Cabinet secretaries call a terrorist could be arrested without a warrant and jailed for up to 24 days. Here’s one last fact: more lawyers have died under the Duterte administration than in the 44 years before he took office.

So here’s the thing: our problems can’t be solved from the Philippines alone. Again, something I’ve said repeatedly: what’s local is global; and what’s global is local.

As we face the coronavirus, there’s an equally dangerous and insidious virus of lies unleashed in our information ecosystem. It’s seeded by power wanting to stay in power, spread by algorithms motivated, created for profit, a business model Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. The reward is your attention, and all this is linked to geopolitical power play. Last week, the EU slammed Russia and China for their intensified vaccine disinformation campaigns. Last September, Facebook took down information operations from China that were campaigning for the daughter of Duterte for president – next year, our presidential elections – that network was creating fake accounts for US elections, and it was attacking me.

The virus of lies is highly contagious. They infect real people, who become impervious to facts. It changes the way they look at the world. They become angrier, more isolated. They distrust everything.

In this environment, the dictator wins, crumbling our democracies from within.

I became a journalist 35 years ago when people power in the Philippines helped spark democracy movements around the world. I had the great privilege of reporting on much of Southeast Asia’s transition from one-man authoritarian rule to democracy. 

Inevitably, there is this one moment when power and money chooses – status quo or change: in the Philippines in 1986, it was an elite family’s banner at a protest rally that helped open the floodgates that ousted a dictator. In Indonesia in 1998, months of student protests led nowhere until the business community and the military stepped in, ending nearly 32 years of Suharto.

Those with power and money must choose.

Ask yourselves these questions: Who are you? What do you stand for? What kind of world do you want in the next decade?

The more you have, the more you must risk.

Because silence is complicity.

Whether you’re at the UN or heading a nation or a corporation, or you’re a politician, human rights worker, a journalist, or a citizen, fight – and win – your individual battle for integrity.

At stake is our collective global future.

Please act now.

Courage ON. Thank you.",0
22,Maria A. Ressa,"He calls his protocol 'SDS' – sanitize, disinfect, sterilize
Business owners have to put their people – and their customers – first. 

Going to get a haircut in our science-fiction world can be an adventure, but when I walked into the Basement Salon at SM Aura, I had a new appreciation for details – noticing how the pens were individually sterilized, the counter top wiped down with Clorox sheets, and how contact tracing was automated with each of us getting a pre-printed sheet with our name on it.

I couldn’t help but ask the owner/manager Michael Webb about his systems, and we compared notes. 

We at Rappler have been extra cautious, putting in place protocols and systems, digging into research, estimating costs. Last March, we began to keep an Excel spreadsheet of everyone’s temperatures, with our managers checking their teams and families. 

I do love learning about how to adapt, and I think Michael’s journey and choices give us a path forward. He came home to help his family business, leaving behind a VP post with a semiconductor company in the US. Those corporate processes and thinking helped infuse his choices, but it’s inevitably his values that dictated his path. 

Working in California, Michael was steeped in the HIV battle and in legislation that was introduced by his father, former senator Freddie Webb. Since a salon is a high contact business, Michael put in place systems to deal with HIV and hepatitis. He said it was only a hop-skip-and-a-jump to use those systems for COVID-19. Looking at his software, he showed how he could go back 3-4 years and know exactly which staff members interacted with each customer.

As I was getting my haircut, I saw that he had separated us into clusters, with staff moving from customers in a systematic manner. Again, easier for contact tracing!

Some highlights from our chat below:

Webb describes 3 protocols he put in place for HIV and hepatitis, which he has adapted to the coronavirus: “There are 3 basic hygiene protocols. The first is you sanitize, which is cleaning. Then you introduce another product, which is a disinfectant. Then the third one is when you render an object inert, which is when you sterilize.” 
Every tool used by his staffers are divided into 3 categories: non-critical, semi-critical, critical: “The ones that are critical are defined as those having a higher percentage of actually piercing skin.”
He calls his protocol “SDS” – sanitize, disinfect, sterilize.
Instead of wearing full PPEs, his staffers wear cotton lab coats. The salon has a steamer, and after each customer, the staffer’s outer garments are steamed, a more effective way, Webb said studies show, than keeping one plastic PPE in place all day.
Webb follows the findings for disinfectants of the US Environmental Protection Agency. He gives us some of what he’s found, including what disinfectants he uses and where.
For his staff, it’s a constant education. Keeping them updated about what he reads, his processes. He also has in place a testing process for his staff, and always emphasizes that the best way is to be aware of where they go and what they do. 
While his salon is ready for Christmas, he says he is preparing for New Year’s Eve, and he shares some of the processes he is thinking about adapting, given that he cannot control all the moves of his staff during the holidays. 

So for him, that most likely means increased testing. He drops a tidbit: the best time to test is 3 days after a potential infection. 

Watch our conversation here.

I asked him about advice he would give to families for the holidays, and he was categorical: 1) Wear a mask and a face shield; 2) Be careful. Avoid going out if you don’t have to. If you want to go to a restaurant, order in; 3) Be hygienic, but avoid overkill at home. 

To Webb, it is about knowing and understanding the coronavirus, and accepting that you have a responsibility not only to yourself and your family, but to your neighbors too.

“I am responsible for my clients and my people. That’s how I feel,” said Webb. “I don’t want to look back and say, ‘I should have, you know, I could have…’ I would rather say, ‘I did the best I could.’”",0
23,Maria A. Ressa,"Information operations are manipulating Filipinos online, but finally, Facebook is doing something to stop that
 

Editor’s Note: The original version of this piece was commissioned and first published online by Time Magazine on January 17, 2019, as part of its series on Facebook and its global impact. This is reposted with permission. 

For a time, my reputation – and peace of mind – was demolished by information operations on Facebook. It’s a cautionary tale for the United States.

I run Rappler, an online news site in the Philippines. In my country, Facebook essentially is the internet, thanks to subsidies from telecommunications companies that let people avoid data charges while on the site. But it has also made the Philippines a showcase for the destruction Facebook can enable.

The attacks against me and Rappler began appearing on Facebook in the summer of 2016. A year later President Rodrigo Duterte was repeating them in his State of the Nation Address. I have since been indicted on politically-motivated criminal charges, faced my first arrest warrant, and posted bail. Not just once, but 5 times in two separate courts. I need permission to travel outside the Philippines.

If I lose these tax evasion cases and others filed by the Philippine government, I could go to jail for 10 to 15 years.

All because I – and Rappler, the startup I helped create, 7 years old this month – continue to hold power to account, to do our jobs as journalists, and to #HoldTheLine against impunity in a drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people, according to human rights groups.

We know first-hand how social media and the law has been weaponized against perceived critics of the Duterte administration. We’ve been reporting on it from the start. 

In early October 2016, Rappler published a 3-part series on social media propaganda. It analyzed the emerging information ecosystem using what researchers later called “patriotic trolling” – online, state-sponsored hate meant to silence or intimidate specific targets. After the exposé appeared, I received an average of 90 hate messages per hour for the next month. 

The attacks on Facebook are insidious and extremely personal, from the way I look and sound to threats of rape and murder. As a former war zone correspondent, I have been in the line of fire, but nothing prepared me for this.

After all, a lie repeated a million times becomes the truth, shaping and conditioning public opinion, seeding the messages that would be repeated by President Duterte himself: that Rappler is CIA, fake news, owned by Americans, many more. It hits me every time I look back because these lies form the basis of some of the legal cases against us.

This is our daily pressure cooker: attacked from below by cheap armies on social media, and from above by President Duterte and the government.

The effort was extremely well organized. Each of the government propaganda machine’s 3 main content creators addressed a different slice of society: Sass Sasot created pseudo-intellectual content for the top 1%; Thinking Pinoy (RJ Nieto) targeted the middle class; and singer-dancer turned government official now congressional candidate Mocha Uson riled up the mass base. As early as 2016, an #UnfollowRappler campaign activated at least 52,000 accounts. That was about 1% of our followers at that time – but consider that an earlier investigation showed us that 26 fake accounts on Facebook could reach up to 3 million others.

What mayhem could more than 50,000 Facebook accounts create?

They can reverse perceptions, splitting the real world from the social media world.

We saw it happen. In January 2018, the Pew Global Attitudes Survey found 86% of Filipinos out in the physical world said they trusted traditional news media. If you live on social media, though, your perception was nearly the complete opposite: 83% distrusted it, according to the Philippine Trust Index released that same month. It happened from systematic and exponentially growing attacks on traditional media, which clearly escalated after Duterte took office in June 2016. In the year before the election campaign, the language Duterte used to attack the media – bias(ed) and corrupt or “bayaran” – barely registered in Facebook comments or posts. Afterward, bias came up 2,000 times a day, and bayaran one day approached 4,000. (For example in one day, bias had an unnaturally high, boosted peak of 30,000 comments.) The attacks pounded fracture lines in society repeatedly until perception was made reality.  These attacks fuel anger and hate to tear down trust in truth-tellers: journalists, human rights advocates; to maintain high approval ratings for President Duterte; and to change the values of a significant chunk of our society who now say it’s okay to kill drug users or to let China have portions of Philippine territory in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea). The attacks wage war against opposition politicians, manipulate the Filipino public, and weaken our democracy.

Rappler knows the best and the worst of what Facebook can do. As the world’s largest distributor of news, its refusal to act as a true gatekeeper allows lies to spread faster than truth. For that, I’m among Facebook’s worst critics. Yet Rappler’s exponential growth would not have happened without the social media giant.

I know its immense potential for good. That is why we continue to work with Facebook, as one of 3 fact-checking partners in our country, defining facts and looking at networks that spread lies.

I don’t think we have a choice. This is transformative technology, and we can use it to push Facebook to understand its true impact – good and evil – in the world. I’m cautiously optimistic that the good can prevail. On January 11, in its second takedown of “inauthentic” sites and accounts in the Philippines, Facebook banned a significant chunk of the disinformation ecosystem manipulating Filipinos with a link to the Internet Research Agency and the Russian disinformation ecosystem.

Rappler had identified the network, and written about it, nearly 13 months earlier.",0
24,Maria A. Ressa,"Great teachers who shape our values, our sense of right and wrong, will always be with us
Note: To celebrate National Teacher’s Month and Filipino-American History Month, I’d like to share this weekend in July with you. This first appeared in Rappler’s Brave New World newsletter, August 9, 2019. 

It was a weekend that stirred my soul and reminded me of the details that create our lives: jokes with lifelong friends; an orchestra room where I spent hours practicing – and the stage where we performed; the ties that created the person I have become.
 
My family left the Philippines in 1973 and settled in Toms River, New Jersey. My parents commuted nearly 4 hours a day to New York City so that their kids could avoid the inner city schools. Toms River’s public school system gave me free music lessons, computer programming classes, advanced placement classes that allowed us to compete in Ivy league schools, a future that promised you can accomplish anything if you work hard enough.

Everyone has a teacher who helped make them who they are. Mine is Donald Spaulding. I cried when I saw the announcement of his death on April 8, 2019 and contacted his family. His kids are now all grown up with kids of their own, and on July 28, the many people whose lives he touched came together back on the stage where we grew up for his memorial concert. When we arrived in Toms River, I was the short, quiet kid who could barely speak English. Mr. Spaulding nurtured me and others like me: kids looking to belong, looking for our place in the world. I first found that in music, and that became the foundation of student government, basketball, softball, theater, so much more – extra-curricular activities and academics that shaped my world. When I graduated high school, I was voted “Most Likely to Succeed.”

I couldn’t have done all that without Mr. Spaulding. He was not just my violin teacher and orchestra conductor. He helped me learn to play up to 8 different instruments (some not very good). All these experiments in my life – that is because of Don Spaulding, who would pick me up from the other side of town so that I could have a chance to participate in rehearsals and gigs.

Without him, life would have been so different.

But that was only the beginning. He pushed me to be better than I could ever be – as a person and as a musician.

He helped me choose the music for all the auditions he pushed me to do – from the intermediate and high school orchestras in Toms River to the Garden State Youth Orchestra to All State to the Garden State Philharmonic to so many more. Mr. Spaulding heard every soaring note and every mistake, and always pushed me to do better. If you have never auditioned for first violin or concert mistress, you do not know what stress is! All my after school jobs then were music related: as a music counsellor at Camp Discovery to our T.R. Express: a country-western group of orchestra nerds playing the music we heard on the radio.

During Sunday brunches, we were a string quartet, but at night, we just had the best fun ever – earning more than I would have earned at McDonald’s or Dunkin Donuts. We got together because I wanted him to sing “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” – and when we finished figuring that out, we just kept playing – Kansas’ “Dust in the Wind,” Dan Fogelberg’s “Longer,” so many more. I will never forget playing at the Ground Round with the peanuts on the floor, at our local mall, at Six Flags’ Great Adventure … so many more.

We were a fixture at pop concerts – what fun we had! So at the memorial for Mr. Spaulding – after more than 3 decades, I picked up my violin and played in an orchestra again.

Our conductor, Sue Viksne Degoey, chose the lineup from what many of us played under Mr. Spaulding’s baton. I stepped into my high school self with Pachelbel’s Canon, and Keith Kalemba composed an original elegy.

We rehearsed for a little over an hour, and there we were, coming together, playing for the memory of a man we all loved. That weekend reminded me again that no one can accomplish anything meaningful alone.

A day before our concert some of my closest friends decided to meet at sunset at Island Beach State Park, bring food and drinks, and catch up over a bonfire.
 
It was a perfect day: a cool breeze blowing, just enough for us to sit in front of the fire and reminisce. Gigi and I lived around the block from each other and biked around the woods behind our houses. It was fun to deliberately get lost and then find our way home. Then we would save our money, and when we had enough, bike an hour to get a coke and French fries. Over the years, she carried so many science projects for me: an exploding volcano (which almost exploded at the bus stop), a solar oven .. and as she reminded me, my violin, guitar or whatever other instrument I was playing that day. I suppose we also gravitated together because we were brown in a predominantly white neighborhood. But it was something we were never conscious of because then the Philippines was a far, dim memory.

The past, present and the future came together, and I realized the person you are was already formed in high school. We fell into our old roles: Lisa, always the organizer who always thinks of everything; Cary, our Greek-American pragmatist; Larry, the boy-scout who built the bonfire; Ruthie, our marinerette; Yvonne, our basketball center … and my kid sister and cousin, who joked they were now part of the big kids’ table. So what did I learn? 

That an orchestra is a perfect metaphor for a working democracy: the music gives you systems and notes, but how you play, how you feel, how you lead, how you follow – well, that’s all up to you. It reminded me how much I loved being in the swirl of music, one part listening and soaring, another part counting the beats, watching the ups and downs of our bows, always part of you focused on the conductor, ready to follow. Excess within control. 

That great friendships, despite the distance of time and place, get better with age.

And that teachers, the mentors who point you in the right direction, will always be with you. Mr. Spaulding brought me back across the oceans, to relive, to play, to cry. Thank you, Mr. Spaulding, for your generosity of spirit, for helping me fit in, and for reminding me that music flows through our lives and connects all of us.",0
25,Maria A. Ressa,"‘This is an existential moment in time, where, if we don’t take the right steps forward, democracy as we know it is dead’

This is Maria Ressa’s keynote speech delivered to a standing ovation from nearly 2,000 journalists at the 11th Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Hamburg, Germany, on September 28, 2019. 

An attack on one is an attack on all.

The first time I heard that was more than two decades ago, looking at the virulent ideology that powered al-Qaeda. That was what the terrorists used to justify their attacks. Then at a pivotal moment, when I was still just learning to deal with the new weapon against journalists, Julie Posetti, who’s in the audience now, convinced me that I should be speaking about these attacks on social media – and within 24 hours convinced me to do an interview for a book she was working on for Unesco. Its title: An attack on one is an attack on all.

This is an existential moment in time – where, if we don’t take the right steps forward, democracy as we know it is dead.

The more I study this time – which started with technology’s disruption, then attacks against journalists, then democracy – the more I’m convinced that the attacks against us and our values are so insidious that the equivalent of an atomic explosion has ruptured our worlds – and all we do is chip away at the tip of the iceberg we can see. But please keep this in mind as I speak: an attack of massive casualties has occurred – and most of us don’t know about it.

I’ll talk about 3 points tonight: the battle for truth, the role of American social media platforms, and what we can do about it.

When journalists are under attack, democracy is under attack. Social media platforms are now the world’s largest distributor of news, but, while they’ve taken the revenues, they’ve ignored the gatekeeping powers that news groups have traditionally had.

It takes courage to fight back against the insidious manipulation these platforms have enabled. They’re now used as a weapon against journalists – where lies laced with anger and hate spread faster than facts. (Facts are kinda boring.)

This really hit me last December when Time Magazine named me one of the guardians of truth. At that point in time, I realized – among the Capital Gazette (the journalists who were killed there), the Reuters journalists still in prison in Myanmar at the time and Jamal Khashoggi – I was the only one who was both alive and free, making me think that never before has our profession…protecting our democracies…demanded so much from us.

The battle for truth is the battle of our generation. With technology as the accelerant, a lie told a million times becomes a fact.

Without facts, we don’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust. Without all 3, you can’t have democracy. This is why democracy is broken around the world.

In our country, the bottom up exponential attacks on social media astroturfing and creating a bandwagon effect soften the ground before the same lies came top down from our top government officials.

I know this first-hand: in 14 months, the Philippine government filed at least 11 cases and investigations against me and Rappler. I was arrested twice in a 5-week period, and I’ve posted bail 8 times in about 3 months. I have committed no crime except to be a journalist and to hold power to account.

I’ve seen social media and our legal system weaponized against those who ask questions, who stand up for values, who demand the rights guaranteed under our Constitution, which is patterned after the US Constitution.

When I was first arrested early this year, the officer said, “Ma’am, trabaho lang po.” (Ma’am, I’m only doing my job). Then he lowered his voice to almost a whisper as he read me my Miranda rights. He was clearly uncomfortable, and I almost felt sorry for him. Except he was arresting me – the last act in a chain of events meant to intimidate and harass me because I’m a journalist.

This officer was a tool of power – and an example of how a good man can turn evil – and how great atrocities happen. Hannah Arendt wrote about the banality of evil when describing men who carried out the orders of Hitler in Nazi Germany, how career-oriented bureaucrats can act without conscience because they justify that they’re only following orders.

This is how a nation loses its soul. So you have to know what values you are fighting for, and you have to draw the lines now: where this side you’re good, and this side you’re evil. Help us #HoldTheLine.

So what about American social media platforms? As many of you know now, I’m both a partner and a critic of Facebook. Rappler is one of two Filipino fact-checking partners in the Philippines. Facebook is essentially the internet in the Philippines.

We are the canary in the coal mine because globally Filipinos spend the most time online (more than 10 hours a day) and on social media (the 4th year in a row we’re the top users around the world). But we are also democracy’s dystopian future.

Early this month, I was with Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie (you know he’s just turning 30 years old), and he told me that the Philippines “creates an ideal petri dish where you can experiment on tactics and techniques that you wouldn’t be able to as easily in the West…and if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter, you won’t get caught. And if it does work, then you can then figure out how to port that to the West.”

I asked him if the Philippines paved the way for Brexit and Donald Trump. You know what he said? He sidestepped a little, but I’ll read his entire quote so stay with me:

Filipino politics kinda looks a lot like the United States. You’ve got a president who was Trump before Trump was Trump, and you have relationships with people close to him with SCL and Cambridge Analytica. And you had a lot of data being collected – the 2nd largest amount of data after the United States collected in the Philippines.

This kid behind the psychological operations web of Steve Bannon backed by Robert and Rebekah Mercer added that “colonialism never died, it just moved online.”

So…this nightmare began for me more than 3 years ago. Rappler wrote the first pieces about it globally in 2016. I wrote 2 of the 3 parts of our first series and was rewarded with an average of 90 hate messages per hour.

If nothing changes, what’s happened to us is going to happen to you. It’s already happening now. Underlying it all is greed and fear, in our case the violence a brutal drug war that the UN says has killed at least 27,000 people, far more than the official number of 5,500.

People are afraid to stand up for what is right because there are costs: Rappler in the Philippines is a cautionary tale – and one of my arresting officers said it best when he was trying to silence our young reporter who was livestreaming. He said: “Be quiet, or you’re next.”

This micro-targeting online ad-driven business model structurally undermines human will. Our personal experiences are sucked into a database, organized by AI, then sold to the highest bidder. It is – as it has always been – about power and money. That has also siphoned money away from news groups, and if nothing is done, this represents a foundational threat to markets, election integrity, and democracy itself.

These social media platforms are behavioral modification systems we voluntarily enter. We are Pavlov’s dogs – and let me quote Wylie again as well as Blackberry co-founder Jim Balsillie: they said that data at this micropersonal level is NOT the new oil. It is plutonium. And we need to treat it like plutonium – with all the care that requires. Remember, I said, an atom bomb has exploded – and we all don’t know about it. Until we accept that, we can’t solve the problem.

So what can we do?

First, journalists need to collaborate. Throw out your old definitions. This is a new world. Collaborating isn’t easy because we were born to compete against each other. In the Philippines, our data tells us that news groups have been pushed to the periphery of our information ecosystem, and in the center are disinformation networks – some linked to Russian disinformation networks, some to China. They are all actively sharing each other – while we are not. This is how alternative realities bloom.

We have to stop taking the bait of emotions. Seek what we have in common over what drives us apart because that’s the way the bad guys are working: they take a fracture line in our societies and pound it open to separate us into us vs them.

And it’s not just the journalists…let’s bring in academia, tech, civil society – the truth-tellers. We have to join forces to protect the facts.

We have to fight now, while we’re strong – because, as we have learned, you only get weaker over time because this virus of lies saps civic engagement. If you have no facts, civil society becomes apathetic, and the voice with the loudest megaphone wins.

Second, we need to demand enlightened self-interest from tech companies because, in the long term, yes, the solution is education; medium term: media literacy. But in the here and now? It’s only the tech platforms that can do something meaningful.

Third, we need to create a global database of disinformation networks, and a global interpol that stops the impunity that nations and companies are getting away with today. Remember after the Holocaust and WWII, the world came together to try to stop the worst of human behaviors. That was when we got Bretton Woods, NATO, the UN Declaration of Human Rights. What are the values that govern the internet? How do we punish offenders?

We need to seriously come together and fight because an attack on one is an attack on all.

Power – and bullies – will never stop if you give in to them. We at Rappler live this every day.

Early this month, our presidential spokesman and chief legal counsel to President Duterte threatened to file cases against two news groups, including Rappler, because we called out a glaring conflict of interest. He split hairs and attempted to redefine his actions based on a technicality. One news group apologized. We did not.

Here’s the twist: the apology wasn’t enough for our Palace spokesman. His words ultimately justified Rappler’s decision to #HoldTheLine.

Political bullies who threaten and abuse journalists are never happy until they get complete capitulation.

Our battle is your battle.

Protect the rights guaranteed by our democracies or watch them slowly erode in plain sight. This is the challenge for all of us today – for next year’s Global Investigative Journalism Conference. What can we put in place today to protect our tomorrows?

I want to thank all the news organizations here who helped us shine the light. Please, let us do the same for every journalist under attack in every part of the world.

Remember: an attack on one is an attack on all. ",0
26,Maria A. Ressa,"Even as we see what's being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now,' says Rappler CEO Maria Ressa in a speech at the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health Commencement Ceremonies
Rappler CEO Maria Ressa addressed the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health’s Class of 2019 on Sunday, August 11, urging them to build their identity, profession, and the nation’s democracy by embracing their values, their fears, and their journey. 

A total of 148 graduates received their dual MD/Master of Business Administration degrees. 

“You will help define what our society will look like and how our democracy will survive and evolve,” she told the graduates at the Meralco Theater. “This is a time of creative destruction. Even as we see what’s being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now,” she said.

Below is the full text of her speech.

Congratulations, Class of 2019!

You’re graduating at an existential moment in history. 

When global power structures are turned upside down by technology, triggering an erosion of all our rights.

When journalists around the world are under attack, democracy is under attack. 

I know this firsthand: in 14 months, the Philippine government filed at least 11 cases and investigations. I was arrested twice in a 5-week period early this year, and I’ve posted bail 8 times in about 3 months. In order to travel, I have to post more than P500,000 in bonds. 

Journalism is not a crime. 

Yet, I’ve seen social media and our legal system weaponized against us – and any other perceived critics of government. 

We hold the line. Because we live our mission. Because – as Time Magazine wrote – we are the Guardians of Truth.

This battle for truth is the battle of our generation.  

Now more than ever, we know that information is power. Without the right information, it’s impossible to fight back – whether it’s to find a cure for a disease or to hold power to account.

We need to fight the insidious manipulation social media technology platforms have allowed: where lies laced with anger and hate spread faster than facts.  

These lies are like a virus that has infected our information ecosystem, playing to the worst of human nature, turning us against each other. They replicate and cripple our body politique – spreading a disease that still has no cure.  

A lie told a million times becomes a fact. Without facts, we don’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust.  

This is why democracy is broken, not just in the Philippines but around the world. 

I’d like to share 3 lessons with you as you go into battle for your identity, your profession, our democracy. 

Embrace your values because with that comes your humanity.
Embrace your fears.
Embrace your journey.  
Embrace your values 

Remember why you chose to become a doctor. 

You chose a specialized degree that has an embedded mission for a broken society. Seven out of 10 Filipinos die without ever seeing a doctor, and the statistics promise you no sleep — like: only 3 public doctors for every 100,000 people.

To those who chose business, how are you going to fight corruption? 

Life is all about making choices. That’s what we do every minute of the day. 

These little choices define who you are, and if you’re not clear about your values, you may wake up when you’re older and realize you don’t like the person you’ve become. 

Every choice defines who you are, and they could be really simple like choosing to turn right instead of left – they lead to different paths. Or accepting a bribe because in your mind you’ve rationalized it as a gift.  

Character is created in the sum of all these little choices we make.  

Now, while you’re sitting there before going into battle, choose the values that define you. Do it now. Because when you’re tested – and it will come if it hasn’t already – you have to know the lines you’ve set. 

Draw the line: on this side you’re good; on this side you’re evil.  

This is what prevents situational ethics. This makes sure you can’t rationalize bad behavior. 

You don’t really know who you are until you’re forced to defend it. Then every battle you win, or lose, every compromise you choose to make…or to walk away from – all these struggles define the values you live by and, ultimately, who you are. 

Then when you’re in battle, avoid the hate: the US against THEM, rich vs poor, dilawan vs DDS – these labels are meant to divide us. Populism is easy. Real leadership is not.  

Find what we all have in common. That’s our humanity. 

Alone we accomplish very little – no matter how bright or talented you are. It’s about what we can do together, to find what binds us together. 

We build a stronger democracy by strengthening our common humanity.  Embrace your fears 

I’ve been asked a lot in the past year: are you afraid? Of course, I’ve had those moments! But CNN trained me to be a conflict reporter, a war zone correspondent. I plan the way in and chart the way out of any field of battle. 

What I’ve learned is that fear spreads and is debilitating. Fear is a luxury.  

If you’re in the middle of chaos, you need to stamp down your fear to have clarity of thought – that’s essential to make the right decision. The way to do that is the 7Ps: “Proper preparation prevents poor performance.”

So I go back to what I learned in school. Fear is your worst enemy. It stops you from doing what you want.  

Whatever you’re most afraid of, touch it. Hold it. Embrace it. Because once you do that, nothing can stop you.  

In my case, dealing with the fear really started last December. That was when Time Magazine named me person of the year – one of the guardians of truth – and I realized I was the only one among us who was then both alive and free. That was the seed. 

Then last April at the launch of the Clooney Foundation’s Trial Watch, for some reason, it became real. I realized I could go to jail – 63 years, in fact, as Amal Clooney pointed out. I was on a panel: Mohamed Fahmy, who was jailed in Egypt for 438 days, was to my right. Jason Rezaian, who was jailed in Iran for 544 days.  

I talked to them. I read their books. Could I endure what they went through? 

What is the worst case scenario I could imagine.  

Then I embraced it. And robbed it of its power.

Prepare for the worst, and hope for the best. 

Embrace your journey

The founders of Rappler – 4 of us, women in our 50s now – well, we joke that we jumped off the cliff. In the Philippines, we’re the only news group whose business is created and controlled by journalists. That’s what we mean by independence. 

So it’s not a surprise that we would continue doing the story, even if – and especially if – it’s bad for business. Yet, despite that, we found a new business model that has our revenues up significantly since last year. We’ll take the risk to do the stories that matter.

The first casualty in our country’s war for truth is exactly how many people have died in our brutal drug war. The police admit they killed more than 6,000 people – rolled back by PDEA right before SONA to 5,600. But human rights groups and the UN estimate that at least 27,000 people were killed from July 2016 until December last year.  

Our impunity series looks at the lives behind these numbers. We fight impunity on two fronts: the Philippine government in extrajudicial killings and the exponential lies on social media – Facebook, which is essentially our internet. 

Facebook is the world’s largest distributor of news, but it ignored the responsibility that comes with that – the gatekeeping powers of journalism, that determines the quality of our democracies around the world. 

I don’t know where any of this will end. Like I said, we jumped off the cliff by standing up for our values, by upholding the mission of journalism, and holding the powerful to account. 

Facebook is our frenemy: Rappler is one of its 3 fact-checking partners in the Philippines, but finding the lies is a game of whack-a-mole. What’s more important is to find the networks of disinformation that spread the lies – and in that you see how all this is connected to geopolitical power play. In our digital forensics, we’ve shown links to the alt-right in Canada, to the alt-right in the US, to Europe, and to Russian disinformation. 

Embrace your journey. And don’t forget to have fun. 

I am daily inspired by our team in Rappler, their spirit, their sense of mission. Despite the threats we face, we are living our ideals now. This is our reality.

What you do today matters.  

You will help define what our society will look like and how our democracy will survive and evolve.  

This is a time of creative destruction. Even as we see what’s being destroyed around us, remember: we are creating the future now.  

Let’s make sure it’s the future we want.  

Get ready for battle. Embrace your values and your humanity. Embrace your fears and embrace the journey. Class of 2019, our hopes are with you. It’s going to be tough but I know you will change the world for the better.",0
27,Maria A. Ressa,"It’s time to ask yourself a question we’ve lived with for years now: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth?
Silence is complicity. 

The blatant abuses of power are now codified into law. It happened in June: a regional trial court’s order changing the period of prescription for libel from 1 year to 12 years; the shutdown of ABS-CBN; and the quick passage of the Anti-Terror Law, under which a critical voice can be named a terrorist, arrested without a warrant, and jailed for up to 24 days. 

The walls are closing in. 

The Philippines is at the precipice. There’s no need to declare martial law because the very processes of democracy have been turned against it. We now live in a time that is “worse than martial law.”

It’s democracy’s death by a thousand cuts. 

The way we at Rappler have survived 4 years of attacks is by: 

1. Shining the light: Name it and demand signatures to these abuses. If we can’t get justice now, we will later. History is on our side. 

2. More hard-hitting journalism: Continue to hold the powerful to account and demand accountability for the people. Of course, the more we do that, the more the full power of the State is turned against us.

3. More innovation: We continue to explore and to build at a time of creative destruction. The Lighthouse, rolling out this week, is our latest experiment and  provides a beacon to safer shores. (Read: How Lighthouse gave us hope)

Hatred, arrogance, and incompetence can only affect you if you let it. The battle begins in our minds. (Read: Rappler ends 2019 with income: A comeback year) 

While I hate being the government’s cautionary tale, I’m not afraid. It made me stronger, solidified the values I believe in, made me draw the line I cannot cross. I will defend the mission of journalism as long as we are a democracy because press freedom is the foundation of every right of every Filipino under our Constitution. My job is to hold up the sky so our journalists can do their work. 

It’s time to ask yourself a question we’ve lived with for years now: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth? I am at peace with my answer.

Everyone who speaks comes under attack on social media, once an enabler, now a tool for oppression. Be prepared for it. Accept this will happen. Social media is now a behavioral modification system. 

We’re demanding accountability as well from the social media platforms, but Lighthouse is also an experiment to see how tech can serve journalism and democracy. Please test it and give us your feedback. 

We can’t do this alone. The impunity of power is brazen, and the battle has now come to every Filipino. (Read: ABS-CBN’s battle is also ours)

We’re not alone. What’s happening in the Philippines is happening globally. In 2018, I laid out 6 action points for the international community. 

Many of you know I spent nearly two decades working outside the Philippines (and recently had a chance to celebrate #CNN40 with my former colleagues). After the June 15 conviction on cyber libel, 60 press freedom organizations around the world came together to help independent media survive in our country. Please consider signing this petition to help me stay out of jail. #JournalismIsNotACrime

When facts are under attack, journalism is activism. Help us #HoldTheLine for our rights. 

Use it or lose it. 

#CourageON.",0
28,Maria A. Ressa,"Technology and the pandemic have destroyed our old world and are forcing all of us to actively create a new one. We need to act now.'
Right before America votes, I can’t help but think we are underestimating the impact of technology on our behavior. Behavioral research has long shown that we vote, not based on what we think, but on how we feel. Now imagine that in today’s information ecosystem, which uses neuroscience and predictive analytics to shape our behavior. It’s an extractive business model that allows “fake news” to flourish.

Technology upended journalism, pitting evidence-based news organizations against propaganda, hate speech, and conspiracy theories. Mocha and QAnon won; news lost. That’s what the data shows. 

For about a decade now, technology has been a tsunami, devastating and reshaping industries: music (Apple, Spotify), hotels (Airbnb), transportation (Uber, Grab), and so many more. News organizations lost their gatekeeping roles to technology. That upended the information ecosystem and the distribution of facts. It began to reshape systems of governance and change the geopolitical power balance. 

The new gatekeepers had easy confidence because they cut the world into quantifiable pieces – never mind if it isn’t true, and never mind the consequences.

Move fast, break things
Decades back, I remember asking questions the engineers couldn’t answer about the impact of their choices on society: on personalization; the lies that you can only mute or block; the unintended consequences of “friends of friends” growth.

Personalized recommendations moved from whatever you searched for (that followed you for weeks online) to personalized news feeds. The question I asked then: how can we all have our own different realities? How can news exist in a world like that? If there is no shared public reality, no shared facts, then democracy as we know it is dead.

Lies that you can only mute or block drive me crazy as a journalist. Because they stay and continue to spread: the more salacious, the faster the spread. Emotions, like anger and hate, spread faster too. That alone showed the abdication of responsibility of the new gatekeepers and how little respect they had for the public.
This played right into long-running Russian military tactics which the public saw in Crimea in 2014. Called the firehose of falsehood, Russian propaganda is meant to “entertain, confuse, and overwhelm.” Fast forward a few years, and now you have leaders of democracies, elected with the help of social media, mimicking the same tactics, like President Rodrigo Duterte or President Donald Trump.

How every social media platform uses algorithms recommending friends of friends to grow your network and their user base. Except that one seemingly minor decision, while good for growth, also built filter bubbles and divisiveness – us against them thinking – into the platforms distributing the news and consequently, into our societies.
These 3 practices and many more are part of a god’s eye-view of data, where content is neither good nor evil, and the goal of accumulating data above all feeds the business model of predictive behavioral analysis, the cornerstone of what Shoshana Zuboff calls “surveillance capitalism.”

One root cause
In her groundbreaking book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, this Harvard emeritus professor argues that many of the problems we’re dealing with today – the weaponization of social media, the destruction of data privacy and security, our inability to hold technology platforms to account – are all part of the same problem: the extractive business model which is insidiously manipulating us without our knowledge. 

Working with Shoshana in The Real Facebook Oversight Board, I’ve put words to my experiences, like “radical indifference” – what she calls “an asocial framework” for evaluating data because in this world, all data is equal. The key is volume, not quality. This is the core of “fake news” – strip branding from news organizations, which differentiate between fact and fiction. In this world, lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and further than boring facts. (READ: The Spread of True and False News Online)

So what do we do about this? Our solution in Rappler is 3-fold, aligned with our founding principles: 1. Demand accountability from technology; 2. Protect and grow investigative journalism; and 3. Build community and civil society. (READ: As democracy dies, we build a global future) 

Build better
This month, the Information and Democracy Forum will be releasing 4 papers from our infodemics working group that former EU Parliament member Marietje Schaake and I co-chair. We recommend policy frameworks around 4 structural challenges: the transparency of digital platforms; the meta-regulation of content moderation; the platform design and reliability of content; and mixed private and public spaces on closed messaging services. 

We see this as a jump-off point for governments, technology companies, and civil society organizations to begin a much needed public discussion with academics, lawyers, and journalists. 

Technology and the pandemic have destroyed our old world and are forcing all of us to actively create a new one. Defining the problem, bringing in all who need to help solve it – these are only the first steps to make sure we create the world we want.

Regardless of who wins the US elections, we need to act now.",0
29,Maria A. Ressa,"Here are 3 battle fronts for a global response – lessons from the Rappler trenches (and how we’re helping build the future now)'
Silicon Valley’s sins have come home to roost. What happened in countries like the Philippines is now threatening US elections. That’s why about a month before the November 3 vote, I joined Carole Cadwalladr, the British journalist who broke the Cambridge Analytica story, and 22 other industry experts in The Real Facebook Oversight Board – “an emergency intervention aimed at Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook employees.”

Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, kicked off our launch on October 1, 2020. “Our group has come together for one purpose: we demand comprehensive action to ensure that Facebook cannot be weaponized to undermine the vote and with it American democracy,” she said. 

We fear it may be too late. Learn our lessons from the Philippines. It’s strange when you begin to see a dystopian future and count the forks in the roads not taken. And you begin to understand how Cassandra and Sisyphus felt. 

PH: First domino to fall
Democracy is dying. That was what I told Facebook in August 2016; what I repeated 4 months later to journalists at the Google NewsLab in Mountain View; and what I said in every keynote around the world, in every award acceptance speech in the past 4 years. 

Lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and farther than boring facts on social media. A lie told a million times becomes a fact. Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, there is no trust. Without all 3, democracy as we know it is dead.  The Philippines was the first domino to fall in 2016, followed a month later by Brexit. As Rappler’s business and technology leader, an investigative journalist, and the target of government attacks, I lived through the different strands that led us here. 

After all, Rappler started on Facebook in 2011. We saw its best and are now living through its worst. Frenemies, I call us. Rappler was among the first to see the problem and worked quietly behind the scenes, but we had a responsibility to tell our public how they are being manipulated. In 2016, we did stories about the impunity of two men: Rodrigo Duterte and Mark Zuckerberg. 

Now I am horrified to watch what is happening as Americans prepare to vote, worried about the campaigning already happening on Facebook for our 2022 presidential elections. 

Without facts, how can any nation have integrity of elections? Does free will even exist with constant, insidious manipulation? 

Learn from our experience in the last 4 years. This is how power shapes reality and destroys trust. With the help of Silicon Valley. 

Machine manipulates us
In 2016, Rappler documented and tracked the data and influence operations: the attacks began after we exposed the pro-Duterte propaganda machine seeding attack narratives like “journalist equals criminal.” 

In 2017, that same message bottom up came top down when President Duterte attacked Rappler in his State of the Nation address. A little more than a week later, we received our 1st subpoena.

In 2018, the law was weaponized: 11 complaints and cases were filed against me and Rappler. 

In 2019, I was arrested twice in a 5-week period and forced to post bail 8 times in about 3 months to stay free and keep doing my job. 

In 2020, I was convicted of cyber libel for a story we published 8 years ago, one I didn’t write, edit, or supervise at a time when the law we supposedly violated didn’t even exist. Yet, a former colleague, Rey Santos, Jr, and I can go to jail for up to 6 years. 

Social media is now a behavior modification system, and we are Pavlov’s dogs. 

We input our atomized selves, and for each post, machine learning builds a model of who we are: it knows us better than our family and friends, better than we know ourselves. Then artificial intelligence takes our most vulnerable moment to a message and sells it to the highest bidder. It could be a company or a country. This pattern of insidious manipulation creates its own feedback loop that keeps the machine learning and growing. 

Cheap state-sponsored armies on social media are in at least 70 countries around the world in 2019, according to the Oxford University Computational Research Project. It is a scorched-earth policy for power and money, now part of the global dictator’s playbook.  We fought back and survived the last 4 years by understanding the data and by realizing how social media abdicated responsibility to protect the public sphere. We built our response on the 3 pillars of Rappler: technology, investigative journalism, community. 

Here are 3 battle fronts for a global response – lessons from the Rappler trenches (and how we’re helping build the future now): 

TECHNOLOGY: The world’s largest distributor of news today is Facebook. Yet, it is biased against facts, biased against journalism at a time when journalists are under attack on at least 2 fronts: our credibility and business model. This is the first priority because we have to stop the virus of lies from coming into our information ecosystem.

Here in the Philippines, we’re helping build technology that will protect users and allow a thinking slow process critical to democracy. This is Lighthouse.

Globally, we need policy solutions. This is why former EU Parliament Member Marietje Schaake and I are co-chairing the steering committee of experts from academe, human rights, technology, and law for structural solutions to deal with this “infodemic.” The initiative has received strong support from nearly 50 foreign ministers from the Alliance of Multilateralism, and is expected to release potential structural solutions in November.

JOURNALISM: Facts must survive, and experiments for the distribution of news must continue, even while the cleanup of social media platforms begin. Independent news organizations must survive this crisis of confidence and trust as well as the continuing assault on its advertising business model.

In the Philippines, Rappler is taking the processes we use for our investigative journalism into disinformation networks, and building them into a product. This is part of the reason that despite the attacks, Rappler not only survived, we thrived. Every company is vulnerable to manipulation and attacks in the age of social media, and aside from dashboards, companies need to pivot and learn to combine structured and unstructured data with the latest technology to protect itself and to build community.

When the law is used to attack journalists, the defense is not just local, it’s global, because it links directly to issues of rule of law and international law. Aside from our Filipino lawyers led by Francis Lim at ACCRA and Ted Te at FLAG, Rappler receives pro bono legal support from Covington & Burling, LLC. Our international team is led by human rights lawyers Amal Clooney and Caoilfhionn Gallagher, QC.

Globally, only 0.3% of development funds go to media, and independent news groups will need help to survive the next few years of our information dystopia. This is why there is an effort to get an International Fund for Public Interest Media established: $1 billion annually raised and distributed globally in a transparent manner. Luminate and BBC Media Action’s James Deane are leading this charge; I am part of its Advisory Group.

COMMUNITY/CIVIC ENGAGEMENT: Rappler’s elevator pitch in 2012 is “we build communities of action.” This changes when it becomes dangerous to speak your mind or when communities can’t tell fact from fiction.

In the Philippines, Rappler continues to grow MovePH, our younger communities of action centered around climate change, fact-checking, gender equality, and health. Since 2018, our communities rallied around our values of speaking truth to power and demanding accountability, and our crowdfunding campaign has helped pay our exponential legal fees.

Globally, journalists and press freedom groups around the world have come together to help Rappler shine the light on abuses of power in the Philippines. Nearly 80 civil society organizations are in the #HoldTheLine Coalition, led by 3 amazing women: Courtney Radsch from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ); Julie Posetti from the International Center for Jounalists (ICFJ); and Rebecca Vincent from Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Let me end the way I began with our most effective civic engagement at this moment in time: the Real Facebook Oversight Board – when journalists, academe, civil rights activists, and government officials past and present made clear demands for immediate reforms to help ensure the integrity of facts and elections. Within our first 24 hours, Facebook acted. 

The worst public health crisis in a century and the death of facts enabled the consolidation of power by populist authoritarian leaders. 

It’s clear now that what happens in the Philippines does not stay in the Philippines.

It’s a brave, new world: like the virus, like climate, the battle for truth – for democracy – is global. 

It’s time we start building the future we want, eyes wide open.",0
30,Maria A. Ressa,"Why Lighthouse? Because journalists shine the light, and a lighthouse is a beacon showing travelers the way to safe harbor.'


Embrace your fear: a lesson I learned when I was young, now even more relevant as we enter week 8 of a pandemic lockdown.

That’s what Rappler learned to do after nearly 4 years of government attacks – from the weaponization of social media in 2016 to the 11 politically motivated cases filed against us in 14 months.

For me that meant seriously thinking about jail. Last year, I was arrested twice and detained, forced to post bail 8 times to stay free. Taken cumulatively, Amal Clooney tells me the charges carry over 100 years in prison. As a consolation, Ted Te reminds me the most I need to serve is 40 years.

I am not a criminal. I am a journalist. 

Yet, this is what it takes to be a journalist in the Philippines today. Submit, accept a Damocles’ sword over your head, censor yourself, or be punished. Well, I never did like bullies, and I’ve learned that you define who you are when you’re tested. When we at Rappler look back a decade from now, we will know we did everything we could to protect our democracy.

So I touched my fear and learned to embrace it. Once you do that, you rob it of its power. We at Rappler imagined worst case scenarios, planned, and drilled for them.

Little did we know our planning would prepare our organization for this pandemic. (READ: #CourageON: All in…together!)

Courage comes from action

Left alone against brutal and immense power, we learned that the real battle is in our minds. You lose when you allow fear and panic to rule.

What kept us grounded was our deliberate effort to strengthen our mission of hard-hitting investigative journalism, not just to be reactive or defensive. After you embrace your fear, what’s next?

You build for the future. You imagine the world as it should be, and you create.

Enter Lighthouse, technology in the hands of journalists, trained to protect the public sphere where democracy thrives. (READ: Introducing Lighthouse: Rappler’s new platform)  

The process of imagining the future fueled our hope. We had tried agile development in 2015 but failed. This time with a mindset to learn, we turned to experts, and slowly, this new way of thinking and solving problems began to seep into our organization. We began to work more collaboratively, combining the top-down journalists’ workflow with the atomized bottom-up tech workflow. 

When I was arrested in March last year, I was thinking of new ways to use natural language processing or how we turn words into data – and many more problems that kept my imagination active. It was only peripherally that I realized there were 7 police in the van driving me from the airport to the precinct, and 4 of them were in full swat combat gear. (Really? I thought.) It was a great way to learn anger management.

Why Lighthouse? Because journalists shine the light, and a lighthouse is a beacon showing travelers the way to safe harbor. 

After the lockdown, it’s not a surprise that groups like the TOWNS Foundation, which raised P60 million and delivered its 100,000th PPE, personal protective equipment, to Cebu last week said they were inspired by action. Or Ken Abante and his 50+ volunteers who monitor weekly where the emergency budgets are going. Or MovePH,  its fact-checking initiatives, and Project Lifeline. 

Hope comes from courage. In a pandemic, where does hope come from? From the courage of our frontliners. From the courage of our people. 

As leaders gain more power around the world to deal with the crisis, we need to be vigilant that we don’t permanently give away our hard-earned freedoms. 

Despite the tragic global death toll, we know the worst is yet to come as workers and companies stave off bankruptcy and fight to survive.

It’s fitting that we introduce Lighthouse on World Press Freedom Day. When lies can kill, facts matter. Accountability is more important today than ever. Our lives depend on it so #CourageON!",0

Clear from the genealogy of PhilHealth is its continuing mandate to provide comprehensive and equitable health care. Policy-wise, there should be no more question that aside from quality education, effective public health is a good “strategy for bringing about faster economic development and improving quality of life.” It’s a direct, and no doubt, quick route to higher labor productivity and economic growth.

PhilHealth descended from martial law’s Medicare as administered by the Philippine Medical Care Commission pursuant to the Philippine Medical Care Act of 1969. Total coverage of medical services according to the needs of patients is its ultimate goal.  It was to be an evolving extension of medical care to all residents based obviously on the nation’s financial capability by mandating contribution to help build the medical care fund. 

The basic idea was first to leverage on both the SSS and GSIS medical programs while preparing to cover non-members on a compulsory and automatic basis. Not bad for a developing country in the late 1960s.

A National Health Insurance Program was established in 1995, mandating the creation of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and replacing the Commission as administrator. This law proceeds from the 1987 constitutional mandate for “an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all people at affordable cost.”

For the same reason, the Universal Healthcare (UHC) Law of 2019 automatically enrolled in PhilHealth all Filipino citizens, including overseas Filipino workers. This means any Filipino can avail himself of health care benefits even without a PhilHealth ID card. There is no better way to institutionalize universal health care than through a contributory health insurance scheme.

Yes, the operative words are accessibility and affordability. 

All citizens shall have access to health services at first “with at least a basic minimum package of health insurance benefits.” The law prioritizes a person’s health needs than his ability to pay based on the principle of risk sharing among various income and age groups. There is also unequivocal mandate for PhilHealth to contain cost to help the people afford healthcare services.

Since not every one of the 113-million Filipinos contributes to the fund, and medical cost is rising like crazy, health premium is not just enough even if it was recently jacked up. With a broad coverage of inpatient care, among others, budget support is essential. Funding is short even with contributions from PCSO and PAGCOR and from the budget itself of the Department of Health. 

For 2024, PhilHealth received more than a hundred-billion-peso budget to accommodate an expanded pool of beneficiaries and to sustain current programs. Some 1.31 million indigent and financially incapable patients are to receive medical assistance. With parallel efforts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other government programs, some 12.75 million indigent members are expected to be reached this year. 

This is far from universal even as the intent is. 

If past WHO data were to be a guide, PhilHealth has a lot of homework to do. With sustained population growth, life expectancy in the Philippines surprisingly declined from 69 years in 2000 to 66.4 years in 2021. In Western Pacific, comparable data actually rose from 72.4 years to 77.4 years. In this age, tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death for children below five. Why, this is a scourge of highly impoverished nations.

And if this is not enough, based on statistics from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the healthcare continues to be a big burden for households. Their out-of-pocket payment had the biggest share of 44.5 percent among the health care funding schemes in 2023, higher than government and voluntary healthcare system.

Comparing the Philippines with other ASEAN neighbors in terms of critical health outcome shows some embarrassing results. Three years ago, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies in a study prepared by research fellow Valerie Gilbert T. Ulip and research analyst Lyle Daryll D. Casas ('Regional Health Integration and Cooperation in the Philippines') concluded that we fell behind our ASEAN counterparts. Normally, health systems must have sufficient health facilities offering different types and levels of health services. 

This is not the case for the Philippines.

For instance, hospital beds are limited, short of 400,000 beds. Half of the Filipinos have no timely access to primary healthcare facilities. We spend only about 1.5 percent of GDP to health, really no comparison with Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Our handicap in health human resources is just enormous. Ten percent of our rural units have only one doctor each while many health facilities do not even have a nurse or a midwife. Finally, our public health capacity for emergencies is extremely low. WHO’s international health regulations gave us a score of only 53 percent, only better than Lao PDR and Cambodia.

No AI is necessary to draw the extent of the challenge for the health sector in the Philippines. There is so much ground to flesh out the universality, accessibility and affordability of healthcare system. 

Adding the regular contributions of members to subsidies from the national government and remittances from both PCSO and PAGCOR yields big, big shortfall. Yet, PhilHealth failed to spend all its money in 2024 to the tune of ₱89.9 billion. 

With dwindling fiscal space and burgeoning public debt that has exceeded the threshold of 60 percent of GDP against the commitment of NG to refrain from introducing new taxes or imposing higher taxes, the only recourse of government is to increase the dividend rate and sweep all “unused funds” from government-owned and controlled corporations.

Finance Secretary Ralph Recto was recently quoted by ABS-CBN News saying that the full remittance and appropriate use of PhilHealth’s ₱89.9 billion could add 0.88 ppts to national output and add 600,000 more jobs. Interesting quote, but first, can the remittance be properly done and second, how does one convert it to output and jobs? (To be continued)",0

As we suggested in our last column, it is no secret that the Philippines’ official sports program is not perfect. 

The first known government sports organization was the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF) in 1911, which was formed only to resolve what was then the ongoing “menace of professionalism” and erosion in Philippine sports. Around 50 years later, in the 1960s, the Association for the Advancement of Amateur Athletic (AAAA) came into being. 

Under martial law, Presidential Decree No. 604 established the Department of Youth and Sports Development in 1974 and abolished the PAAF, transferring all its resources and functions to the Department. Later renamed Ministry of Youth and Sports Development in 1979, it was mandated under Letter of Instruction No. 955 to implement Project Gintong Alay (PGA).

PGA sought to put under one roof all development programs of athletics, first for track and field, and later for some other sports. Reported prodigies include the legendary Lydia de Vega, Isidro del Prado, Hector Begeo and Elma Muros. 

Aside from these initiatives, if there’s anything that speaks best of our desire to land in the podium, it is the 1987 Philippine Constitution’s declaration of the importance of sports in establishing a healthy and functioning citizenry. 

In 1990, with the significant evolution of global sports, then President Cory Aquino signed into law a new government sports agency with stronger and more focused objectives. The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was thus born to transform the Filipino people into “a healthy citizenry through various commendable sports development programs.”

The Commission’s vision is focused on one, increased participation in sports by Filipinos, and two, excellence in sports performance by Filipinos. Its mission is to coordinate and implement our national sports program, democratize sports access and training, and elevate the level of training for highly talented and promising athletes for global competition. 

Filipinos can bet that there has never been a dearth of sports projects and programs across the country. PSC lists in its website Batang Pinoy, Indigenous People’s Games, Laro’t Saya sa Parke, Philippine National Games, Pilipinas Para Games and Gender and Development Program. 

So, what ails Philippine sports, that our medal campaigns in global competitions have been sporadic and obviously incoherent?

Veteran sportswriter Joaquin Henson explained some years ago in the Philippine Star why the Philippines has yet to win an Olympic gold after nearly a hundred years of participating in the Olympics. For him, it was “an arduous journey of frustration, exasperation and disappointment.” At that time, the Philippines held the distinction of second in the world for reaping gold-less medals with 10, Malaysia being the first with 11. 

Henson cited the lack of coordination between the PSC and the private organization Philippine Olympic Committee (POC). Government is focused on grassroots development and yet controls the budget to finance national athletes. Meanwhile, the POC consists of the national sports associations that aim to develop star athletes but is undermined by reported politics, graft, nepotism, and incompetence. We are no match to Thailand, Henson argued, which had accumulated more than 30 medals in only 70 years of its Olympics participation. 

Henson also blamed the so-called shot-gun approach in allocating limited resources to several sports, a clear exercise in dissipation. Instead, we need our sports officials to concentrate on niche sports calibrated with weight classification like boxing, judo, weightlifting and similar sports. It would be considered suicidal if we continue to spend feeble resources on sports where our likelihood of success is slim because the sports is free for all.

Funding is another reason for our weak performance not just in the Olympics, but also in the Asian Games or SEA Games. While the law requires the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) to remit five percent of its gross revenues to the PSC, or at that time, ₱200 million monthly, what goes into the operation of the Commission is much less than the required remittance.

Perhaps it’s not asking for the moon if we can also professionalize both the PSC and the POC; less politics, more action. If we can do this, the budget for sports could be rationalized and properly allocated. If the plan is intentional and executed properly, with scorecards and accountability, we should be able to see good, institutionalized results. We can finally add more numbers to our sports greats, those talents that can harvest golds and silvers in global competitions — not as a matter of luck but as a matter of course.

In the last 10 years, it was reported that the PSC received an average of around ₱180 million annually from the public treasury. On top of this meager allocation, the PSC also gets money from PAGCOR and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes (PCSO) and a few other government institutions like the National Sports Development Fund. With additional funding from the Bureau of Customs, Philippine Racing Commission and private donations, that could easily amount to nearly ₱900 million a year. While this amount can seem staggering to the normal Filipino, it’s peanuts compared to what other countries are spending on sports and their athletes. Obviously, this disparity in investment explains our suboptimal performance in international games.

Despite it all, our athletes’ podium finishes prove that we are a country of hope, and that our resilience shines not just during flash floods, but also in the international arena. If we could produce a Hidilyn Diaz in weightlifting and a Carlos Yulo in gymnastics, we must be doing something right. But we could surpass ourselves if we succeed in producing more Diazes and Yulos on a more regular, more systematic basis. 

Yes, we’ll achieve more mileage if we channel some of those prizes to our reinvented sports program. Our athletes deserve a better life after the Olympics, something that could hopefully inspire rather than slacken them. But a better sports development program that produces excellence on a more regular basis should always be the first best.",0

Tik Toks have institutionalized the Carlos Yulo landings in his floor routine for which he was awarded a perfect 15. We see people ending whatever they are doing with Yulo’s trademark open arms, or a series of tumbling into their shoes. With a 3.5 twist, Yulo ascended the Olympic podium with his gold medal, the first man to win an Olympic gold for the Philippines and second to weightlifting idol Hidilyn Diaz to harvest gold from the Olympics. He surpassed himself by winning a second gold in vault competition. Some commentators and sports writers were convinced his ability is otherworldly.   

It is otherworldly because his sports mastery started in his youth. At seven, his grandfather, impressed at his initial stunts at a local playground that is the Paraiso ng Batang Maynila, motivated him to focus on gymnastics. Since they stay along Leveriza Street which is close to Paraiso, he had all the time to do his stunts and tumbling routine. Paraiso truly was once upon a time a training ground for young athletes and sports enthusiasts. In the distant past, it was equipped with some playground equipment and sports facilities including monkey bars. 

Yulo could have been born several years later and missed out on these public facilities, now rare in many localities. They should cost almost nothing compared to the local governments’ own revenues and national tax allotment. Local governments never seem to realize they could produce Olympic champions by spending on some systematic sports development programs that could just spark our young Filipinos’ interest and inspire them to get into the loop. One does not need intelligence fund to highlight the importance of this public infrastructure in nurturing young bodies to global competitiveness. 

From Leveriza, Yulo moved on with his journey with destiny. He competed in various Palarong Pambansa almost annually and won gold, silver and bronze medals in various contests in gymnastics. As a junior, he won mostly gold in the ASEAN School Games and Pacific Rim Competitions. As a senior, Yulo harvested more medals at the Melbourne World Cup, Baku World Cup and Doha World Cup, among others. 

All told, Yulo has emerged as a young and living sports icon. He is a two-time Olympic champion, six-time world champion with two each for gold, silver and bronze; ten-time Asian Games champion; and nine-time SEA Games champion. 

With Yulo’s short stature, social media seems more enamored with “the precision of his form, and the difficulty of his routines especially in the floor exercises, vault and parallel bars.” Nothing beats congenital mastery. 

As the nation awaits Yulo’s return from Paris, enormous benefits await him, too.

The Philippine government is giving him ₱20 million cash while ₱6 million will come from the House of Representatives. The Philippine Olympic Committee is also gifting him with a house and lot. What was originally a two-bedroom condo unit in McKinley Hill, BGC worth ₱24 million, Megaworld was reported to have upgraded it to a three-bedroom unit worth ₱32 million, with ₱3 million cash bonus.

As if these were not enough, Yulo will also be getting from different donors such benefits as lifetime free eating privileges both buffet and ala carte, free gastro consultations and colonoscopy, free engineering designs and free furniture worth a hundred thousand pesos. The Guardian reported that he was also offered franchises for a coffee and lemon business plus a ₱10 million brand ambassadorship contract for a beauty clinic.

Dazzling, but these acts of appreciation may miss the point.

True, these donations to Yulo, and previously to Diaz, would hopefully inspire them to do many times better in the next Olympics, and many more young athletes to follow in their footsteps. But we need more than that. We need to institutionalize excellent performance in world sports competition. Sad to say, the previous budget allocated to sports development by past comparisons is not even a 10th of what other ASEAN countries spend on sports development. GMA news once described the country’s sports budget “like loose change against the income” of boxing legend Manny Pacquiao.

In fact, for 2025, the budget allocated to the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was reduced from ₱1.156 billion in 2024 to only ₱725 million. This budget covers general operations, amateur sports, training and preparation for the SEA Games in Thailand and the Asian Winter Games in China.

So, whatever happened to the Philippine Senate’s Resolution that commended the brilliant Yulo for winning the gold medal for the men’s floor exercises at the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Competition in Stuttgart, Germany. The Senate also recognized the potentials of Filipino athletes and in particular Yulo’s achievement as a “wake up call for our government to focus and provide more support to our athletes” competing in sports where size does not matter. 

We recall what happened nine years ago when the Philippine sports contingent to the SEA Games finished a poor sixth, the PSC cried “lack of budget.” At the Tokyo Olympics of 2020, Filipino athletes complained that the Philippine government failed them. Even Diaz herself complained of insufficient funds for her training that eventually led to the Philippines’ first Olympic gold.

As Muhammad Ali once quipped, champions are made from something they have deep inside them — a desire, a dream, a vision. For Ali, the will must be stronger than the skill. A sports development program would build the skills of our young athletes, it is hard work, strong discipline and perseverance that would build their will.

Sustaining his will is going to be a tall order for Yulo. Aside from the easy life that awaits him, and this could soften him a bit, he will have to face the reported issue with his own mother and his final decision on the next chapter of his love life. In sports like artistic gymnastics, any small distraction could cost the gold.  (To be concluded next week)",0

Sana dumami ang trabaho. Sana ipagtanggol ang West Philippine Sea. Sana ipatigil na ang POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators). The civil society demands a good scorecard from this government.

With a fine-tooth comb, NEDA as the planning authority should do the monitoring having been mandated to prepare the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028. It’s an excellent Plan because it formalizes a comprehensive roadmap complete with actionable policies and programs and sets for Congress an appropriate set of legislative priorities to address both short-term and medium-term issues. A good scorecard and monitoring system should lead to a good execution of public policy. Otherwise, the vision for this nation could just ossify on paper. 

We focus on controlling inflation because it remains the most urgent concern of the Filipinos based on the latest Pulse Asia Survey for June 17-24 and Octa Survey for June 26-July 1. Around two-thirds of Pulse Asia and Octa respondents rated inflation control as the most urgent national concern. 

Inflation is closely related to the other concerns like increasing workers’ pay, because higher prices weaken their purchasing power. Reducing poverty is also critical because prices are already high. Creating more jobs is a direct means of empowering people to mitigate their poor condition and weaker spending capacity. Finally, fighting graft and corruption is considered one big impediment to appropriate public policy to provide infrastructure and social services. 

Table 1.1 of the PDP 2023-2028 provides us with the baseline of food and headline inflation at 5.7 percent and 5.6 percent for the period January-November 2022. For both indicators, the target was set at two to four percent for 2024 and 2025. 

We consider three components behind the inflation management in the Philippines. One is appropriate monetary policy; two, is a set of strong non-monetary measures to manage the supply side; and three, responsible fiscal policy. 

On monetary policy, we give high credit to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In the last six months of the previous administration, the BSP was so behind the curve before it decided to tighten monetary policy. This was rather too late and too little. For as early as March 2022 onwards, actual inflation had already reached the 4.0 percent upper end of the target, with inflation forecasts also subsequently breaching their targets for both 2022 and 2023.

When the Marcos government took over on July 1, 2022 the new BSP leadership jacked up the policy rate by 75 basis points (bps) from 2.5 percent to 3.25 percent in an off-cycle meeting. That and more adjustments came, running a total of 450 basis points to address the surging inflation for both 2022 and 2023.

By December last year, the year-on-year monthly inflation fell within the target at 3.9 percent. For the first six months of this year, inflation averaged 3.5 percent. The new BSP leadership should also be commended for keeping its focus on price stability even as various quarters called for a monetary policy reversal in order to stimulate the credit market and stimulate economic activities. 

It is not correct to suggest that today, the BSP should have eased monetary policy because one, it is using lagging indicators; two, monetary policy has lagged effects of about 18 months; and three, inflation data masks cumulative effects of previous price movements.

In reality, the BSP sets its monetary stance not by looking at the past, but by looking into the future based on its forecasts for the next two years. Whatever monetary steps taken today would not be felt tomorrow or the following week, but over a period of about 18 months. Previous inflation rates are monitored because they are useful in discerning how the previous decisions fanned out. Finally, because inflation eats into the purchasing power especially among the daily wage earners among us, the BSP has to be stubbornly committed to win the war against inflation. Due to dominant upward risks, the BSP was correct in keeping its tight monetary policy until today.

After all, the impact on growth has been quite manageable. High inflation discourages personal consumption which accounts for around three quarters of GDP. 

Well, what the BSP could have avoided was its press statement on a possible early easing ahead of the US Fed that rattled the FX market and sent the peso past the ₱58 to a dollar exchange rate. Given the exchange rate pass through, and if prolonged, that could have some inflationary consequences. At the time, the BSP’s risk-adjusted forecasts exceeded the target.

On non-monetary measures, high mark is impossible. Food, especially rice, production is not sufficient, farmers’ productivity remains low. The ax should fall squarely on the Department of Agriculture, National Irrigation Authority, DTI and other relevant government agencies. We have yet to see a coherent food security program. No wonder for June alone, food inflation continued to be high at 6.5 percent, no farther away from the previous year’s 6.7 percent. Rice inflation remained double digit at 22.5 percent. 

There is an Interagency Committee on Inflation and Market Outlook. Its mandate is clear: address supply and logistics issues including measures to combat immoral and illegal profiteering. They have yet to deliver. For instance, it took eternity to get the tariff duties on imported rice reduced from 35 percent to 15 percent. 

A few words about public finance. There was so much in the 2023 and 2024 national budgets that could have funded priority infrastructure in agriculture and industry as well as in research and development, education and skills retraining programs that could have easily translated into higher economic growth and perhaps better supply outcome, something good for inflation management. Fiscal consolidation is also crucial because the fiscal space is slim; excessive spending could reignite higher demand pressure. This could compromise price stability. For this metric, fair score is fair.

The IMF’s Tobias Adrian talked about 10 metrics aimed at helping central banks (CBs) and policy makers fortify CBs independence. Adrian was quick to point out that “this is the first new CB independence index in 30 years.”

These 10 metrics are: CB governor’s independence from the executive; CB’s governing body’s independence from the executive; budgetary independence from the legislature; monetary policy independence from the executive; primacy of price stability; long-term direct lending to the government; short-term lending to the government; financial independence; lending outside the financial system; state audit bodies role in ensuring operational efficiency of CBs.

He admitted to his audience at the Bank of Thailand in mid-June that many of these self-explanatory metrics are based on existing indices with new variables introduced including financial and budgetary independence, board composition, and the role of state audit bodies. Based on the views of central bankers themselves, Adrian stressed that the most critical component of CB independence is financial independence. To them, the least important is short-term lending to the government.

In the Philippines, one can only imagine what would happen to the independence of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) if it were to ask Congress for annual appropriation, or seek additional capital. Members of Congress could even investigate the Monetary Board why it has kept interest rate steady for more than a year, or closed an erring bank with strong political backing. 

Good, the 1987 Philippine Constitution explicitly mandated the establishment of an independent central monetary authority and implemented by Republic Act (RA) 7653 of June 14, 1993 by establishing a new autonomous and independent BSP in the same year. After a quarter of a century in 2018, RA 7653 was amended by RA 11211 increasing its capitalization from ₱50 billion to ₱200 billion. 

However, if indeed financial and budgetary independence is most critical, the continued independence of the BSP rests on the complete capitalization from ₱50 billion to ₱200 billion. But after the BSP charter amendment six years ago, only ₱10 billion was added to the BSP’s initial capitalization. With the establishment of the Maharlika Investment Fund, the full capitalization of the BSP could be further delayed because the BSP’s annual dividend that should be reverted to the central bank for capital build-up will instead be diverted to the investment fund up to P50 billion.

But as Adrian would remind us, CB “independence is significantly stronger in the countries where inflation targets are more firmly entrenched in central bank operations.”

Weaknesses are seen at the level of CB management as well as in its budget and financial operations, monetary policy and the prohibition of lending to the government and outside the financial system. Since financial independence is considered most important, any improvements here can offer the bigger “bang for the buck.” He recognized that future legal amendments may be necessary but long and winding. 

Instead, he advised the use of several IMF tools requiring no legislation. The first tool is the IMF Central Bank Transparency Code or CBT released in 2020. The Code has five pillars consisting of transparency in governance, policies, operations, outcome and official relations. Each pillar consists of various components that could guide CBs improve their transparency and communication practices that lead to policy credibility. 

The second tool is stress testing CBs’ balance sheets. Doing this will help them assess their own financial independence. As Adrian clarified, this is particularly helpful for many advanced, and for that matter even emerging, countries that expanded their respective balance sheets due to the exigencies of the pandemic. This should also be useful for CBs with large and active foreign exchange operations that expose them to interest rate and duration risks on their FX securities. Such risks should be properly considered in CB capital policies.

A quote from Adrian should resonate too many CBs “…a deteriorating CB balance sheet would negatively affect profit distribution — ultimately creating fiscal risks, including through the possibility of having to recapitalize the CB.”

We dread the day when CBs have to lobby with their parliaments for additional capitalization. They would be forced to bite the political bullet. 

The last tool is the CB operational efficiency review. This should require the CBs to rationalize their operational costs to achieve efficiency. Policy-related costs are left out but other costs including staffing, procurement, and other logistics costs are benchmarked against best practices. This will encourage CBs to avoid unnecessary expenses especially in staffing and procurement which may be subject to corruption.

While Adrian referred to the 10 metrics as the first in 30 years, an interesting article came out from the World Bank on “Measuring the Independence of Central Banks and Its Effect on Policy Outcomes” by Alex Cukierman, Steven Webb and Bilin Neyapti 32 years ago in 1992. They developed four measures: legal index; rate of turnover of CB governors; index based on a questionnaire answered by specialists in 23 countries; and an aggregation of the legal index and the rate of turnover. 

Their interesting finding: legal independence is not inversely proportional to inflation in developing countries but it is the rate of turnover of CB governors which turned out to be a better proxy for CB independence. 

We cannot therefore resist the temptation to conclude with the World Bank’s quote of Arnold Lobel’s 1972 comics: “Frog and Toad Together:”

“Willpower is trying hard not to do something that you really want to do,” said Frog.

“You mean like trying not to eat all these cookies,” asked Toad.

“Right,” said Frog. He put all the cookies in a box. “There, now we will not eat any more cookies.”

“But we can open the box,” said Toad.

“That is true,” said Frog. He tied some string around the box. He got a ladder and put the box up on a high shelf. “There, now we will not eat any more cookies.”

“But we can climb the ladder…” ",0

At the IMF, countries are represented by their central banks in the International Monetary and Financial Committee while the finance or development ministers constitute the joint Development Committee to advise both the World Bank and the IMF mostly on issues related to economic development in emerging and developing countries. In particular, governance issues of central banks have often been the focus of lively debates at the IMF. 

Just last week, the Fund’s Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department Tobias Adrian guested at the Bank of Thailand’s (BoT) Annual Retreat. His remarks focused on central bank independence and why it’s needed and how to protect it.

Adrian’s appearance at the BoT could not have been more auspicious in the face of a running conflict between Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s efforts “to exert more control over the country’s central bank after repeatedly clashing with the monetary authority on economic policy,” as reported by Bloomberg two weeks ago.

No less than Srettha himself who admitted seeking advice from former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra on economic policy. And what kind of advice would Thaksin give to Srettha on monetary policy, for instance, other than what he demanded from the BoT during his time? Thaksin’s populist streak pushed him to pressure the central bank to adjust monetary policy and prioritize economic growth over the central bank’s mandate to manage inflation.

What is bad for Thailand is that its new leadership right from the start in September 2023 announced that it was aiming to accelerate economic recovery and ease taxpayers’ financial burdens. During the same month, the BoT decided to jack up its policy rate for the 8th straight time to 2.5 percent, the highest in a decade. This tightening mode was sustained at its November 2023 meeting.

Srettha, who is concurrently finance minister, openly requested a rate cut from the start of 2024 and as Nikkei Asia reported, even summoned BoT Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput to his office on Jan. 10. He even disclosed to the media that he suggested to the central bank head to have more frequent coffee even at the BoT headquarters. Nobody can deny it was an open attempt by the head of the Thai government to meddle with the central bank.

But Sethaput who graduated from Yale was not new in the public service. He was more than equipped and experienced to stand his ground that easing monetary policy when inflation remains an issue is just wrong. The BoT kept the rate unchanged at its Feb. 7 meeting.

Recognizing the independence of the BoT did not prevent Srettha from suggesting that “it should not ignore people’s suffering.” The problem with the Thai Prime Minister is that he’s arguing from nothing. He wanted a rate cut because he believed the Thai economy is in crisis. BoT’s view is contrary to Srettha’s: “domestic demand continues to expand…key factors hindering growth outlook to be external and structural.” It’s pointless to reduce interest rates because growth is emasculated by falling exports due to China’s own economic slowdown and low labor productivity. 

The BoT is also concerned that should interest rates are reduced, the Thai baht is likely to weaken. If they start easing before the US Fed, that action could lead to investors dropping Thai assets in favor of foreign assets, and trigger baht selling in a big way. That is inflationary. Srettha does not seem to cover this ground.

Another concern of the BoT is its pride as an independent central bank, something that not all central banks may be steadfast to defend at all costs. Beyond pride, the BoT is correct in its assessment that if the financial market begins to perceive it as being soft on preserving its independence, such could lead to what they call “double baht-selling.” That is injurious to the Thai economy, that is suicide for the central bank. 

Clearly the Thai government appears focused narrowly on short-term stimulus measures because its eyes are on the next election. On the other hand, the central bank and its veteran staff would always be the gatekeepers of long-term stability of the economy. There is bound to be a delineation between politics and economic vision. 

Thus, Adrian’s remarks are timely and they must be inspiring for those in the trenches at the BoT. He had a number of very precious messages to the central bankers in Bangkok.

First, he talked about setting the stage. Central banks face tremendous pressure from politics because as monetary policy had to be tightened due to the post-pandemic inflation, economies slowed down, unemployment rose and fiscal position worsened. Their balance sheets bloated by the amount of support they extended to their governments. The financial institutions that they regulate are now demanding that they should also live up to the same standards of governance, risk management and transparency that central banks require of them.

Second, independence remains necessary even as some sectors called for greater oversight of central banks. Who supervises central banks? Empirical evidence is clear that higher central bank independence is associated with lower inflation.

Adrian quoted the US Council of Economic Advisers’ blog about the US Fed as a classic example of the supreme value of independence. Even as actual consumer price inflation had exceeded the target two percent, inflation expectation has broadly been steady at two percent because the US Fed is perceived to be independent and therefore its monetary policy remains credible and effective in combatting inflation.

What are the metrics of an independent central bank?

In his remarks, Adrian indicated that together with his co-authors, Lev Menand of Columbia University and Ashraf Khan of the IMF, they collaborated to produce a new global index for central bank independence. Ten metrics have been developed aimed at helping central banks and policy makers strengthen central bank independence. (To be concluded next week).",0
37,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND FOREST Certainly it was exhilarating news last Sunday, that decision of Fitch Ratings to affirm the Philippines’ investment grade rating at BBB, a notch above the minimum investment grade. Equally significant is the stable outlook that Fitch maintained for the country.


Such a rating action of one of the three major credit rating agencies rewards us for all the efforts of government, business and the rest of the civil society to address the debilitating economic scarring of the pandemic a few years ago and to come to grips with the thinning fiscal space. We did not do badly in achieving respectable economic growth, bringing down inflation and mopping up slippages in public finance.


The marching order  is to deliver on this recent favorable credit rating.


Fitch has a list of the Philippines’ macro strengths as well as structural weaknesses. Keeping the BBB label and stable outlook  means Fitch recognizes our strong medium-term growth. The significance of such an outlook hinges on our ability to reduce government debt to GDP ratio in the next few years. And for us, the imperative of securing cheap and reliable energy, good governance, strong connectivity throughout the islands and optimizing our demographic advantage.


What sets us back? 


We have a low GDP per capita which signals sustained demand for resources to fund various social amelioration projects away from infrastructure and to us, debt servicing ability. Fitch also argues that governance standards are weaker than those of its BBB peers even as it agrees World Bank indicators of good governance could be overdoing it.


On growth prospects, Fitch shares the World Bank’s cautious optimism with its 5.8-percent GDP forecast for 2024. It was correct for Fitch to have attributed last year’s slowdown to the growth-boosting, pandemic-mitigating public expenditure and high inflation. Spending on the pandemic is dissipating this year while high price pressure restrained private consumption and investment. While El Niño could be bad for agriculture, power and water supply as it was, La Niña could also limit business activities in the second half of 2024. 


The challenge to our policymakers? 


Fitch expects this medium-term expectation to be supported by what it calls “large” investment in infra and reforms to foster trade and investment, including renewed interest in public-private partnership (PPP). 


A good plank to this positive growth outlook is gradual fiscal consolidation. Fiscal sustainability ensures continued infrastructure and social services that all should result in stronger business activities. Higher fiscal deficit is not per se bad, as long as growth is secured and a fiscal consolidation plan is in place. Well, the Philippines is into it, and the remaining task is to pursue it, and pursue it well.
Fitch in this latest watch believes “there is some risk of a further fiscal slippage given the government’s continued focus on economic growth and the approach of mid-term elections in May 2025.” Fitch implicitly hopes that the focus on tax administration will produce good results.


We have time and again pointed out that keeping public spending at 60 percent of GDP, or below, secures our overall economic well-being. This is basically the same message of Fitch to the authorities. If this is delivered, then Fitch is justified in saying that our debt profile is stable. 


On external payments position, Fitch zeroed in on the current account deficit which is indicative of an emerging country’s reliance on foreign saving. Fitch says it is narrowing, and its expectation is that it will drop to below 2.0 percent of GDP by next year from last year’s 2.6 percent. This is very achievable with the continuing growth of the economy and the harnessing of indigenous, renewable power sources. 


Fitch also considered the country’s external financing as favorable because it comes from long-term borrowing and foreign direct investment (FDI). The latest good news is that our gross international reserves (GIR) hit a historic high of $105 billion in May. This should further convince the credit rating agency of the country’s strong ability to repay its external obligations.


For obvious reason, Fitch recognized that inflation pressures are moderating. While upside risks continue to threaten price stability, the BSP’s initial success in inflation management was apparent with the sustained retreat of core inflation since 2023 up to May 2024. Contrary to some views, the BSP’s hawkish monetary policy is yielding good results. The challenge is to intensify on those non-monetary measures including stronger supply chains and lower but time-varying tariff duties on imported commodities.


Fitch also commended the BSP’s inflation-targeting framework and flexible exchange-rate regime. They are sound, and they are credible. The government’s use of BSP resources during the pandemic was controlled and shortly reversed while the calls for generalized fuel subsidies were justifiably resisted.   


Finally, Fitch observed that the Marcos Jr. administration “has continued to advance structural economic reforms with the overarching aim of catalyzing private investment.” Much space for growth has been gained with the improvements introduced in the PPP law, Foreign Investment Act and Public Service Act. If this commitment to sustain game-changing economic reforms is upheld, we have a good chance of going back to the old growth path prior to the pandemic of 2020.


Fitch rating action also showed some rating sensitivities. In the first place, a stable outlook means stable, neither an upgrade nor a downgrade is forthcoming. But the stable outlook could also turn positive if strong adherence to macroeconomic sustainability is maintained, fiscal and debt metrics show constant improvements relative to GDP and finally, governance standards are firmed up. 


While this recent affirmation from Fitch is good news, the challenge is without doubt to deliver on those macroeconomic concerns that could bring about better future for our country and people. 


There is an enchanting whole new world of difference when we are rated A or A-. It means we have attained that level of growth that job opportunities are more plentiful and lower inflation promotes higher purchasing power for our people. ",0
38,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT It was the American political scientist Hans Morgenthau who proposed that the word “equilibrium” is equivalent to “balance.” Nothing is more important than ensuring the stability of the whole while preserving the independence of its components. In its global application, we have an equilibrium when nations are not only independent, but they are also entitled to exist. 

From its perspective, China believes regional stability may be preserved despite the assertion of its territorial claims over parts of the South China Sea that belong to and are within the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. That is not just bullying, it is also an outright violation of the UN Charter that prohibits “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”

Ironically, the UN Security Council can play double standard, or engage in doublespeak, by a unilateral veto of any intervention even against their own belligerent action. We saw this type of violations by the United States’ invasion of Iraq, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its war against Ukraine, and of course, China’s hostile presence in the South China Sea. National sovereignty was without question violated without any obvious consequence. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China can seem to get away with its territorial adventurism. 

As proof, China dismissed the 2016 arbitral ruling in favor of the Philippines “null and void.” In fact, China continues to deal with maritime visitors in the South China Sea with lasers and water cannons. It has standing regulation authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain “trespassers” to its claimed territories including the traditional fishing ground of Filipino fishermen. 

What is pathetic is China’s argument that it is the Philippines that is compromising regional stability by involving another great power. China badly needs shadows and mirrors to realize it is arguing on technicality. When a big power like China can afford to ignore rules-based arbitral ruling and insist on its own definition of what falls under its own territorial jurisdiction, the only way to prevent territorial adventurism is precisely to establish international alliances. Without such a counterweight, China could very well secure a wholesale title over practically the whole of South China Sea.

China could afford to throw its weight around the world because since 1978 when it started to open up to the world, its GDP growth has averaged more than nine percent every year. Over 800 million Chinese people have literally escaped absolute poverty. China is now the largest exporter in the world, a global factory no less. 

At the conclusion of China’s Article IV consultation a week ago, First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath could not have been clearer in describing China’s economic development over the past few decades as remarkable.

With a country of over 1.4 billion people, China is the world’s second biggest market. Its land area covers five time zones and occupies borders with some 14 countries. The world’s third largest country in land area, China is now the second largest economy in nominal output and the largest economy based on purchasing power parity. China is credited with having grown its nominal gross output from just over $150 billion in 1978 to around$18 trillion in 2023. 

It's no puzzle then if China should nurture some ambition to challenge the US’ global leadership. In naval power, China between 2014 and 2018 alone succeeded in launching more vessels than the total number of ships in the German, Indian, Spanish and British navies combined, as Foreign Policy wrote in 2020. 

Xi Jinping’s announcement of a “new era” in 2017 meant that China must “take center stage in the world.” Establishing regional hegemony is a crucial step and this implies that China must assert itself as the dominant player in the Western Pacific. We now see China exerting strong influence in security and economic affairs in the region and neutralizing US alliances. The South China Sea is an excellent showcase of its growing weight in the region and its aspiration in the larger global stage.

But there is one thing that could go wrong for China.

It is their ability to manage the strong headwinds of aging population, weaker investment, and geo-economic fragmentation. These big picture issues translate into slow growth, weak exports and currency, and a deepening property sector crisis. Governance remains an existential issue. With growth dynamics strongly entrenched in China with its extensive and deepening capital markets, China should be able to overcome these risks.

But if China fails the economic test, its global posture may be considered to be nothing more than a paper tiger.

But there is another thing that could go well for China.

It is the US and its western allies themselves. Recently, former IMF Economic Counsellor Raghuram Rajan correctly observed that “the Western alliance itself is fraying.” Self-interest is driving the weakening consensus on economic direction. The US itself, while demanding openness in trade and finance, is doing so based on its own definition of openness. Doublespeak can be easily discerned and it could undermine the US and its Western allies including those in the Asia Pacific.

If this shift in economic power is to be reflected in the IMF and World Bank governance through an appropriate adjustment in country quotas, China may ultimately end up with the largest quota and of course, more extensive influence. Rajan pointed out that under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the Fund’s headquarters may have to move from Washington, DC to Beijing. 

If the Fund persists in its tradition of reforming itself incrementally through modest adjustment in quotas without fundamental changes in governance and management structure, then Beijing would have another platform to pursue its global ambition.

Whether this is going to lead to better political equilibrium will be an open question for some years to come.",0
39,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT Some TikToks say it all. To afford a rare McLaren 620R, worth at least $280,000 or more than ₱16 million, one should get used to living in a farm and running a piggery business. Prepare to live a simple life, grow with your father’s workers and yes, do homeschooling. After a few years, branded jewelry, bags, and dresses worth millions of pesos would complete your ensemble as you ride your own chopper after winning a local election in a small town north of Luzon.

Many have been monitoring the Senate hearing and from all the public declarations of Mayor Alice Guo of Bamban, Tarlac, that is her story. That is her life. Change the details here and there like the McLaren that she said she just borrowed, but keep the details about the simple farm life of her childhood with no personal recollection of her playmates and the mother Amelia Leal that she never saw, and that’s Mayor Guo’s 38 years. 

To be sure, there were more questions than answers that our senators elicited from the Bamban mayor.

Why she could not establish her origin escapes us. She could not recall who raised her up as a youngster,or who taught her at home except a certain Teacher Rubilyn. Her birth was registered only when she was 17, but there was no record of where she was actually born because hospital records are non-existent. Her residential address at best was fictitious. While she claimed her family had embroidery business in Valenzuela, a quick search revealed no such business was ever conducted there. She indicated a home address in Valenzuela but no less than Senator Sherwin Gatchalian belied it. Someone he knew owned the place. Most damning, both the couple whom she claimed as her parents have no existing birth and marriage records in the Philippine Statistics Authority. Whatever questions were thrown at her, Mayor Guo invariably insisted she grew up in the farm, and she lived a simple life.

As Senator Loren Legarda quipped, “para namang may script.”

But the script, although it looks expansive, was rather weak and incoherent because there remained many loose ends in Mayor Guo’s narrative.  Securities and Exchange Commission records show she’s one of the incorporators holding substantial shareholdings in at least 11 companies since 2010. Allegedly born in July 1986, that means she was only about 24 years old when she amassed so much to have organized such a business network. She acquired a helicopter in 2019 at age 33 for an air taxi business but gave it up when the prospects did not reportedly prove promising. She also engaged in car dealership which she allegedly used to justify her ownership of 16 vehicles even as they remained under her name.

Her Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) showed very rapid increase in her net worth. The script failed to provide the mayor with the answer to the questions of the senators on how she accumulated higher net worth in such a short time. 

Let’s be real, we can do a thousand iterations of the piggery or embroidery businesses, car dealership or similar business activities but no way could they yield a combined income to allow Mayor Guo to afford expensive jewelry and much less to finance the purchase of a chopper even for business that ultimately failed, and the 10 hectares of land on which POGO operators built a whole hub of gambling complex.

Before she ran for mayor of Bamban, Guo in September 2020 applied for a license to operate Hongsheng Gaming Technology, Inc. Before she was elected mayor, she claimed she divested from the business. When the same technology company was raided, it had rebranded itself as Zun Yuan Technology. During that raid, a Ford Expedition belonging to Guo was found. Electric bills of the Zun Yuan premises totalling some ₱15 million were charged to Guo herself and that covered the period as recent as September 2023 to February 2024.

Perhaps the script failed to anticipate the discovery of the so-called illegal activities at the POGO hub in Bamban in March 2024. What is suspicious here is that Zun Yuan was located in the Baofu compound just behind the Bamban municipal hall where the mayor holds office. Baofu Land Development that leased the compound to Zun Yuan is owned by no other than the mayor herself. The complex consists of 32 building structures with a reported tunnel structure as an escape route. 

Why the mayor did not even bother to check the extensive POGO operations in her own property is a puzzle to many. The raid established that illegal activities such as human trafficking and illegal detention were done in the mayor’s property. Official reports showed that there are torture chambers in the complex, panic rooms, vaults containing millions of pesos and dollars with confiscated passports of foreign employees. The Bamban POGO was reported doing other business outside its license. Cyber fraud operations were suspected to have been committed.

What is left unsaid, and perhaps it was supposed to be in the subtext of the players rather than in the script, is the motivation of Guo in running for mayor of a second-class municipality where the POGO operations had been in full blast. 

If we go by costs and benefits, it was argued in the Senate that the social and economic costs due to POGO including crimes, tax evasion, foregone foreign direct investments and tourism at some ₱143.3 billion far outweigh the benefits estimated at ₱134.86 billion for allowing POGO. Net cost to the country is more than ₱8.4 billion. 

That is the paradox of POGO but somebody else wrote the script for us.",0
40,Diwa C. Guinigundo,"OF SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT Bloomberg and online news last Tuesday reported a closing rate of ₱58.27 to a dollar, nearly the same level it did on Nov. 8, 2022, and the worst in 18 months. BSP Governor Eli Remolona emailed media  to explain that “the peso weakened beyond ₱58 to the US dollar today, in line with other currencies in the region. The dollar continued to strengthen as the Federal Reserve signaled delay in cutting interest rates.” 

The governor captured the immediate dynamics of the peso’s weakness but there are more to it, and some could be traced back to the BSP itself.

First of all, no one can fault the US central bank for suggesting that rates may remain higher for longer. It is correct to stay tight because the US economy is robust and resilient, humming with the stock market, while domestic inflation has so far proved stickier at around three percent against the two percent target. 

But we read a different story from the broadsheets last Friday.

The BSP announced that it may start cutting interest rates as early as August for a total of 50 basis points (bps), as “recent inflation uptick was not as bad as expected.” To many observers and media reporters, such a statement sounded less hawkish even after the Monetary Board kept the policy rate steady at 6.5 percent.

Such a statement is not exactly in synch with the BSP press statement issued after the Board meeting the day before. Its penultimate paragraph could not be more than hawkish: “The Monetary Board deems it appropriate to ensure sufficiently tight monetary policy settings until inflation settles firmly within the target range. A restrictive policy stance will also help keep inflation expectations anchored amid a possible buildup in upside risks to future inflation.” 

As to its institutional commitment, the BSP press statement could not have been more steadfast in reiterating that it “remains ready to adjust its monetary policy settings as necessary, in keeping with its primary mandate to safeguard price stability.”

But to say that the BSP “still has room to cut rates before the US Federal Reserve,” up to a possible 50 bps may confirm that the MB meeting was “dovish.” The market’s demand for US dollar soared and we ended up the other day with the peso’s weakest showing in 18 months. 

It is not impossible for some to speculate that monetary policy is less worried about inflation than the prospects of growth. After all, the Development Budget Coordination Committee recently announced lower growth targets of 6 percent-7 percent for 2024 and 6.5 percent-7.5 percent for 2025. 

And domestic inflation seems to be about to break through the inflationary spiral of March 2022-November 2023 with the less-than-expected inflation of 3.8 percent in April 2024. If the May 2024 inflation should turn out less than 4.0 percent, then one can safely say price pressures are losing steam, and the issue boils down to how much stronger are the upside risks the BSP identified during last week’s policy meeting.

As proof, the BSP announced risk-adjusted inflation forecasts of 3.8 percent for 2024 and 3.7 percent for 2025 from 4.0 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. With these solid forecasts, the BSP could have dwelt more on the favorable dynamics of inflation and the impending success of hitting the target after two years. Issuing instead a forward guidance of an August easing when the US Fed looks keen on staying higher for longer is bad timing. After all, a risk-adjusted forecast of 3.8 percent for this year is not exactly “benign.” In our previous lingo at the Board in times past, it is “manageable.” 

If the risks identified as upside risks amplify themselves beyond programmed magnitude, the upper end of the target could easily be breached. 

And here’s the rub: telegraphing to the market the likelihood of an easier monetary policy in the next few months was enough to upset the foreign exchange (FX) market. Therefore, the crash of the peso beyond ₱58 is not exactly unexpected. Moreover, the situation turned for the worse when the BSP admitted that it was intervening less. Unless the BSP once again affirms its strong commitment to checking market volatility and ensuring order in the FX market, the breach in the ₱58 line in the sand could be further extended.

If the peso further weakens over a prolonged period, the exchange rate pass through could begin to kick in, and inflationary tendencies may resurge. What is “manageable” risk-adjusted forecasts for 2024 and 2025 could be easily beaten. Nobody fancies this. 

Yesterday’s report about the country’s April balance of payments deficit of $639 million from March’s surplus of $1.2 billion does not inspire a stable peso. The shortfall derives from the government’s massive debt repayments. Cash remittances from our overseas workers are at best anemic. And the deficit is not true only for the month of April; the first four months of the year also yielded a deficit. 

It would not also help the peso and inflation if at this time that monetary policy should remain cautious against a tight US Fed to talk about a possible reduction in the required reserve ratio (RRR) from 9.5 percent to a possible five percent. That will release hundreds of billions of pesos into the monetary stream. True, a high RRR is distortionary of financial intermediation. But its expansionary effects cannot be discounted at this time when aiming for a lower inflation is still imperative.

On the other hand, the market may wish to read the emerging scenario with more care and give the BSP more credit that it is now seeing an early victory against inflation. Our monetary authorities may just be too excited to share to the business community what it intends to do once inflation is firmly under control, reduce policy rate and then by lowering the RRR, infuse the market with more money.

41,Jose Ma Montelibano,"The excitement surrounding gold and bronze medals, as well as the near-misses, has reached its peak. The first half of August has brought us more golden moments than ghostly ones, which I consider a true blessing. Now that we are in the second half of the month, the character of August is beginning to shift back to its traditional atmosphere.

The weather has been relatively mild, with no typhoons so far in August, thanks to July, which preemptively took the brunt of Typhoon Carina early on. We have experienced a few thunderstorms, but that is just typical for this time of year. This month, I’ve monitored two earthquakes so far: one in Surigao del Sur and the other off Northern Bohol. However, perhaps the more concerning issue is Taal Volcano, which has been emitting volcanic smog (or vog). Kanlaon Volcano remains restless but has been calmer since its disturbances two months ago.

What is turning increasingly sour is the political landscape, particularly the escalating feud between the Marcos and Duterte families. This conflict has sparked speculation that extends beyond mere politics, hinting at misgovernance and crime. I’ve read about congressmen pushing for the Commission on Audit (COA) to audit or disclose its findings regarding the hundreds of millions in confidential funds under the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education. Furthermore, there is tension surrounding the Vice President’s complaint about the reduction of her security detail, which has been cut from over 400 personnel to just over 300.

The more sensational news revolves around revelations from a former Customs Intelligence officer, who claims that after apprehending a large quantity of imported shabu, he was arrested and imprisoned. There is also a video from a press conference in which former President Duterte angrily and publicly orders the arrest of the Customs officer. Today, allegations suggest that the Duterte family has been involved in the importation of shabu along with controversial Chinese nationals. Adding to the troubles of August, the Bureau of Immigration reported that former mayor Alice Guo, a suspected non-Filipino citizen who managed to run for and be elected, has left the country without passing through border controls. Even more troubling is the possibility that Alice Guo might have been entering and exiting the Philippines without the knowledge of immigration and border officials. Golden moments are quickly overshadowed by embarrassing incidents, all courtesy of the pervasive corruption eroding the foundations of our governance and noble culture.

As I write this, we are in that part of August 2024 when a super blue moon lights up the sky. A super blue moon occurs due to the combination of three astronomical events: a full moon, a supermoon, and a blue moon. According to NASA, this rare alignment happens when the different cycles of blue and supermoons coincide on the calendar.

What is technical or cosmic in nature is not only beautiful to behold but also sparks many other conversations, particularly in astrology. Special meanings are ascribed to unique astronomical coincidences, and I cannot fault those who believe there is something magical or spiritual about full moons in general, and super blue moons in particular. Nature has a way of reminding us, through its beauty or power, that there is much we still do not comprehend. We do know, however, that full moons are truly a sight to see and that the moon’s movement affects ocean tides.

In our ignorance of the full context and role of the moon in earthly life, we tend to dismiss its significance—unless one is connected to life around the ocean and seashores. Or, in that ignorance, we speculate about hidden meanings, both spiritual and occult, using our intuition or imagination.

Ignorance often drives people to act in ways that can be irrational or even foolish. When we lack understanding, we feel insecure, leading us to create configurations of life that ease that insecurity. Too often, we follow blindly, either a cult leader or a herd. One thing is certain: we cannot help but speculate, even gossip, simply to vent our fears. Many politicians or religious leaders have exploited this throughout history, profiting and gathering armies of followers by tapping into the fears of the uninformed.

In more recent times, however, there are fewer spellbinders and religious fanatics, mainly because money has overtaken many of them. Money has taken on god-like powers because society has decreed it so, placing it as the primary value in life. Money is now considered the master key to all problems, replacing the deity we once revered. Our traditional value system has become warped and is now centered around money as the ultimate goal. This distortion persists until death becomes imminent and undeniable, coupled with the growing realization that money cannot halt our mortality.

The ascendancy of money is proportional to the descendancy of our capability to stand on our two feet from the power of what we can do ourselves. The more we do not know how to fend for ourselves, the more we depend on money to do it for us. This weakness is what makes the world go round, as the old saying goes, as money is the tail that wags the dog. It is pitiful to witness the way money has risen to capture mankind over my lifetime, but it is a bitter reality that must be admitted.

In the true sense, there is no learning poverty among our young. Children by divine or natural design are like sponges – they learn whether they try to or not. If there is now a measured “learning poverty” among them, it is directly proportional to the poverty of teaching – meaning what is taught is poor, impoverished, severely lacking in quality and in spirit. This is, to my mind, the greatest challenge before us today, how to undo the artificiality of the life we live and discard the alternative reality dominating us.",0
42,Jose Ma Montelibano,"August, the ghost month. I always thought it must have been the Chinese influence on our local culture, but Google says that the ghost month is part of the traditional belief systems of several other Asian countries as well. According to these beliefs, the ghost month is when the doors of the spirit world are opened, and the restless spirits search for peace, prayers, or pleasure in the earthly realm.

What complements and deepens the belief in the ghost month is that August often brings heavy rains or typhoons, resulting in floods. The ghost month is typically wet, gloomy, and inhospitable. The climate enhances the eerie atmosphere of August, as if nature itself is warning us to be cautious and to stay indoors, given the challenging weather conditions.

However, there were signs that August 2024 would be different from the typical ghost month.

Typhoon Carina arrived early, bringing torrential and record-setting rains and floods, and setting a gloomy tone after a relatively well-delivered presidential speech during the SONA had eased the negativity in the air. But that was in July, not August. Instead, August began with a bang. From being ghostly, it turned golden, thanks to Caloy Yulo, who won two gold medals. Female boxers Nesty Petecio and Ain Villegas contributed two bronze medals, bringing the Philippines’ total to four Olympic medals—the most in our Olympic history.  I know there were disappointments too, but winning medals at the Olympics is no easy feat. EJ Obiena and Bianca Pagdanganan came close to adding two more bronze medals, but fate was not kind to them. Neither were the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) and the National Golf Association of the Philippines (NGAP), which failed to provide our national golfers, Bianca and Dottie Arbina, with their uniforms. They provided many excuses, but none justified the embarrassment our golfers faced while having to paste the Philippine flag on their personal T-shirts.

Anyway, what an August this has been so far—so opposite its reputation—and I am thankful. At the same time, August still remains the ghost month, with two more weeks to go. I suggest we stay careful and cautious, even if we do not wish to focus on the negatives. The world is turbulent; it is not just the spirits who seek peace. The Middle East is a hot global flashpoint, the Russia-Ukraine war continues, and the West Philippine Sea remains troublesome for Asia.

The situation on the home front is equally troubling. The rivalries between the Marcoses and Dutertes are escalating in intensity and becoming increasingly contentious. It’s an unusual conflict arising from two partners who recently achieved success in winning the presidency and vice-presidency. However, a third of the electorate believes that the Commission on Elections (Comelec) secured this victory through a seemingly miraculous Smartmatic system. Lacking technical expertise, I reserve my condemnation on this matter. Nevertheless, I previously highlighted the illegitimacy of the 2022 elections due to widespread vote-buying.

While the two-thirds, amounting to approximately 31 million voters, who claim to have supported Marcos and Duterte are becoming embroiled in a deepening conflict, I take solace in the fact that the minimum of 15 million voters for Leni are choosing to remain detached from the struggles of the deeply divided Uniteam. They should continue to distance themselves from this escalating dispute, which could potentially turn deadly. It is enough for these 15 million to uphold their integrity, thereby fostering honesty, transparency, and accountability in their own lives.

In times of chaos, we must ground ourselves and our families in fundamental survival principles within a spirit of bayanihan. Very few among us are wealthy enough to comfortably weather sudden upheavals. We must safeguard our food supply, strive to produce as much as possible, and work together to establish a more localized food network.

If we pay attention, we notice that government projects are now often worth tens or even hundreds of billions. There isn’t much we can do about that except hope that project costs are inflated by no more than 30% since the rumored kickback is around 40%.

While some individuals can engage actively in anti-corruption initiatives, most of us should focus our efforts closer to home. Embrace sustainable practices and grow your food wherever possible. Those in the majority who face financial hardships can mitigate the effects of inflation by cultivating as much of their own food as they can.

By taking charge of our own needs instead of relying on others, we can also teach younger generations to be resourceful. A resurgence of the Do-It-Yourself culture must begin with food production. Being self-sufficient empowers us, ultimately fostering confidence and resilience. Our children and grandchildren will not learn these essential skills unless we pass them on. They are already victims of what is termed “learning poverty,” which naturally indicates an equivalent poverty in teaching.

There is a long list of things that are already wrong that can get worse, but that is not our focus in this article. Rather, like our athletes who made it against the worse of odds, we must try to go for the gold, too. We have waited for our leaders to solve our problems and, as a result, we have dug our own holes deeper. There is no Tallano gold, no 20 peso/kg rice, and no Uniteam – only budol after budol.

I pray, sooner than later, that we understand how the brighter tomorrow is in our hands first before the leaders try it themselves. But if we fail, I believe that they, too, will fail.",0
43,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I was with friends when the news of Caloy Yulo winning his first gold medal was announced. Immediately, the euphoria began. We could not help it; it felt like rain after a long, painful drought. I do not think it was just a drought of Olympic medals, even if gold. We know that we are up against the elite athletes of the whole world in their own unique arena – the Olympics. We want the gold like everyone else, but we know it is not a matter of entitlement, not something we can expect as a matter of right. That is why, when we get it, like Caloy got it for us, we celebrate like crazy – one of our own is the best among the best.

Our euphoria, however, was much more than that. Yes, Caloy’s first gold triggered it, but there was a dam about to burst and it did. Beyond sports, many Filipinos have long been in a painful drought. It is hard to put in words because then, they would sound partisan, as though the drought is only a matter of politics. No, it is not. It is more than politics, it is more than economics; it is everything that we call a better Philippines, the search for what is good and right, for peace and harmony, and freedom from poverty and the cesspool of exploitation that blankets the country.

The one thing about living long enough and being observant for most of it is that I see aspects of reality not as random events but as parts of continuing threads. This capacity is not mine alone but for every Filipino who remembers, looks, thinks, and can connect the dots, as they say. Vicious cycles remain both vicious and cycles only because the pain from experiencing them is not learned or quickly forgotten. Those who use the political slogan “Never Again” must be aware of how inutile it is for people who forget and cannot connect the dots.

It takes a deliberate decision to pursue what should be a common dream for all citizens after that dream is frustrated again and again. Septuagenarians like me, no matter how much of an activist we may have been earlier in life, also tire, also despair, also want to give up. We have witnessed the vicious cycles more times than we care to count, and it makes us wonder if reason and intelligence are truly natural features of humans. I have wondered for a long time, and I only know that I cannot count on the consistency of these great faculties. One thing that I have always counted on is the idealism of the young. It is like a guaranteed gift, a divine safety mechanism against the weakness of man when tempted by greed or lust for power. And, by the way, I do not mean only public officials, whether elected or appointed. In a democracy, the majority of citizens have to enable the greedy and power-hungry. In our democracy, the majority of citizens have truly empowered them. There may be a variety of reasons, but ultimately, citizens have empowered the greedy and power-hungry.

Staying in a democracy that needs us badly to be the citizens that a democracy needs forces us to find our hopes and aspirations in the nobility of our young. From birth to teenage years, the fire of idealism is a natural force. However, it is not invincible. During this same period, idealism is exposed to the harsher realities of life. It may be material poverty and the squalor it festers in that inflates our animalistic nature rather than grows our humanity. More deadly, though, is the squalor of corrupt values and the behavior they engender.

Understanding this as one cycle I have observed in the decades I have lived, it now makes me doubt if all the activism for good governance and good citizenship is worth pursuing. The dramatic shift of societal values from our traditional ones to the dominant ascendancy of money and power cannot be restrained simply by a Constitution, no matter how idealistic it is. In fact, the more idealistic the Constitution is, the more impossible it becomes to adhere to.

There remains only the natural idealism of our young before they lose it to compromise and the need to survive in a materialistic world. Nurturing that idealism is becoming more urgent as the strongest prevention against perennial corruption and poverty. Strange as it may seem, the greedy and corrupt try to hide their dirty ways from their own young as long as they can. Advocacy to nourish the young’s idealism should have more open access to them with the least resistance from the evildoers of society.

This idealism is being unnaturally weakened by the very system we had hoped would strengthen it – mass education. That is why I am so focused on learning poverty, especially that part which measures our almost total failure in developing among our young students the capacity to grasp instructions. I am much less concerned with language, math, and even science as subjects. It is this incapacity to grasp instructions that stunts the development of the body, emotions, and mind. We risk losing the vaunted Filipino trait that has made us resilient against man and nature – diskarte or resourcefulness.

I acknowledge the remarkable achievements of Caloy Yulo and all other athletes who have elevated our national pride before the world. I congratulate them, and I am grateful to them. I have celebrated, enjoyed the moment of victory as though my own, too.

Now, I must remain focused on the 91% of public-school students who are victims of learning poverty. Even amidst the victories and celebrations brought to us by selected heroes of the moment, I cannot shake the thought of this 91% of the Filipino public-school students and the bleak future they face. It is to them and their liberation from ignorance or incapacity that we must dedicate more of our lives.",0
44,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I chose to write this article well before my weekly deadline. My mind is full of thoughts that I don’t want to let fade away once the current crisis is over. I recall September 25-26, 2009, when Typhoon Ondoy devastated Metro Manila and surrounding provinces, dumping a record amount of rain. Who could have imagined that Typhoon Carina would follow in Ondoy’s footsteps and even surpass it in rainfall?

Fifteen years ago, I was younger and more able to actively participate in Gawad Kalinga’s relief operations. What I witnessed was heart-wrenching. It wasn’t just the extent of the damage; it was who was affected and why. Typhoon Carina’s impact was no different—it was the poor who bore the brunt.

As always, there is widespread criticism of government inefficiency and possibly neglect. This pattern remains unchanged from 15 years ago. While there are now more details about the 5,500 flood control projects that were not there in 2009, the response remains similar. Government reactions, including Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s focus on trash and climate change as primary causes, are superficial. The root causes are deeper and more complex, which is why the flooding in Metro Manila will persist beyond his term.

Trash is merely a consequence, not a root cause. It exacerbates other issues. While the poor communities along riverbanks are often blamed for the trash, we must ask a crucial question: Why are they there? Riverbanks, canals, seashores, and crevices are not suitable for habitation, yet millions of Filipinos have settled there. They only end up being displaced when natural or man-made disasters strike, such as fires in the slums. But they will return, as they have in the past. Some slums in Metro Manila have been there for 50 years or more.

The reason they are there is straightforward: they have nowhere else to go to survive. The next question is: Where did they come from?

Many are survivors of previous calamities in their home provinces, mainly in the Visayas and Bicol, which are frequently hit by typhoons. When storms, earthquakes, landslides, and floods devastate their communities, hunger drives them to seek work in cities and towns. They leave because they have no other option.

Thus, when discussing calamities, climate change, and trash, we must address poverty. We need to understand the impact of calamities on the poor and how hunger and despair force them to relocate.

Poverty, like flooding, damages lives and property. To address poverty, we must examine who is affected, why, where, and how. Poverty is a consequence of deeper issues, leading us to the root cause: corruption.

Corruption is an insatiable force that consumes everything in its path if given the chance. Addressing Metro Manila’s flooding also means tackling corruption and poverty, not just adapting to climate change.

Looking at corruption and poverty in the Philippines requires a brief historical perspective. In the past, when our population was small and land abundant, the datu system needed people to make land productive. People had real value, while land was less significant.

Colonial rule, however, introduced a greedy master. Colonizers, driven by the desire for loot and bounty, distributed land grants to favored individuals as rewards or in exchange for tribute. Since it was all agricultural then, tribute from people mostly meant what people could produce. Despite the abundance of land, people were all the more necessary for cultivation and tribute. People retained more value over land.

Modernity shifted these dynamics. Advances in science and technology, particularly in reducing infant mortality, led to a population boom. More people served the few elites, who maintained their power and wealth. The elite, both historically and currently, have exploited others. This exploitation, deeply rooted in history, continues to shape our society. And why the term elite still carries a pejorative nuance about it.

Development has followed a master-slave dynamic, making calamities disproportionately destructive to the poor. The zoning laws and their enforcement are suspect, to say the least. They produce comfort for some, luxury for a few, and almost inhuman conditions for most. The real estate developers do not plan for the poor, but the government must. And it never did with a sense of respect and dignity.

Knowing what we have known for decades from our own weather patterns, government and private developers never established clear and equitable zoning principles. Naturally, when the ratio between land and people allows density, even traffic flow is choked – all for money.

Despite the Philippines’ democratic ideals, historical and traditional patterns of superiority and entitlement persist. Until democracy evolves beyond these historical inequalities, the divide will remain, with only superficial gestures toward equality. And we can forget solving floods in a metropolis that continues to defy safety and social risks.

Democracy is not a gift but a challenge. It must be earned, and it requires sacrifice, even the possibility of death. Democracy can be a powerful shield against calamities, poverty, and corruption if it prioritizes the common good over elitism. Intervention towards a sick metropolis can correct extreme anomalies and guide future development to be more friendly to the majority.

The power of democracy lies in the hands of the people, if they choose to seize it. I do not see it coming soon, however, because the people, especially the poor, continue to endure their fate.",0
45,Jose Ma Montelibano,"The Sona is over but the rains and floods are just starting. From a special report card day with a lot of clapping and cheering, it is back to the streets – and the streets are very wet.

I used to remember as a kid that we had longer rain months 70 years ago versus today. It’s either the La Niña phenomenon was occurring quite often then, or global warming has generally shortened the annual periods of rain. Because of that memory in the 50s and 60s, I am less worried about the frequent rains than I am with the longer hot months.

Pagasa today would describe our climate as 6 months wet and six months dry. This ratio is not at all when I remember, and not also how our climate was described decades before. Maybe Wikipedia has a better description that Pagasa, maybe because it can trace global climate records further back in time. Wikipedia claims we have three seasons instead of two, and I think I understand and accept why.

The three seasons are: a hot dry season from March to May, a rainy season from June to November, and a cool dry season from December to February. If I recall correctly, a powerful typhoon visited my hometown one early December in 1951 and devastated Bacolod City among other cities and towns in Central Visayas. The whole roof was blown away and we had to abandon that house. I do not need to recall the names of other typhoons that hit the Philippines on Decembers, Januarys and Februarys. That means the cool dry season described by Wikipedia is too often visited by not only rain but strong typhoons. Perhaps, because of my later advocacy against poverty, I had personally participated in relief and rehabilitation work when typhoons hit from December to February (mostly in the Visayas and Mindanao).

In historical warfare, terrain and weather are the most critical factors. They are matters of life and death that can cause victories or great defeats. But they remain critical factors in our daily lives as Filipinos as well. Between El Niño and La Niña and the pattern of typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions we experience, I am puzzled why our national and local governance do not give terrain and weather the importance they hold over our daily lives.

It is no surprise, then, that we go through the same consequences of disasters that are already part of our national cycle. If we do not put terrain and weather front and center in our daily and annual planning, we are going to get hurt – not the terrain and weather. And it is the poor among us, many more than the official numbers used by the government, that suffer the most.

Since this pattern has been happening since our independence from the USA, the cumulative damage to lives, property, and our way of life is shocking. More than that, it is almost criminal negligence by both national and local governments. Most actions have been reactive, ending up as band aid solutions to recurring threats. I have seen many sea walls put up over the last several decades, standing there as evidence of what appears to be more than just short-term interventions.

It is sad to say but I just have to, not as a way of putting blame on the elite, that the rulers of the country, including the government, never cared enough for the poor majority. The evidence is how we treat the victims of disaster, not just after a calamity, but thereafter as well.

Landlessness was a root problem because of this elitist consciousness in society, as though there was no recognition and appreciation of a divine plan that created a sacred relationship between man and land. For such a God-fearing people, or so claimed by many, a fundamental mandate of survival was belittled, as though the vast majority without wealth or influence can live like birds on a tree or fish in the water.

Man is a mammal, and from a scientific point of view, man is also a mammal that is part of the animal kingdom of the species Homo sapiens. In other words, man needs land and cannot exist without that land as part of his environment. He needs water and air, too, of course, but so far, it is his need for land to survive and develop as a human being that is most threatened, restricted, or denied.

The Filipino poor in my lifetime, or since operational independence in 1946, has been so undervalued that control and free use of land had been denied him. Most Filipinos were squatters, unable to get titles to land where their own ancestors had been born, lived, tilled, and died for centuries. A document overtook the value of human beings, disregarded their natural rights to their ancestral lands, because others a century or more later titled lands they never originally possessed.

As a result of modernization, when those with land titles began to find greater value as real estate rather than producers of agricultural products, millions of Filipinos were restricted or evicted from lands where they and their ancestors had lived. Displaced Filipinos had to go to seashores that stayed valueless, to upland slopes where the rich had no interest, and riverbanks and canals deemed unbuildable areas.

Then came the storms, the floods, the droughts, the earthquakes, and the volcanic eruptions. Those living along seashores and upland slopes were forced by hunger to move to urbanized areas in town centers and cities where they could beg or find menial work. Because of the terrain and the climate, plus the shortsightedness of greedy businessmen and corrupt government officials, Metro Manila and similar cities absorbed refugees from calamities and witnessed slums grow.

We pay for disregarding natural and social laws, for violating our higher cultural values and norms, succumbing to personal interests over the common good.

Yes, the Sona is over and Typhoon Carina just jolted us back to reality.",0
46,Jose Ma Montelibano,"According to Ping Lacson, it was just a joke, and I accepted it as a joke with a sharp point. After all, the term “designated survivor” had a specific context and meaning after it became the title of a movie. But since a legally designated survivor was the one who said it, I felt the former senator was more right than wrong.

However, the assassination attempt on Donald Trump makes me think about designated survivors again.  Our world today is a most divided and contentious one with generous slices of violence. Assassinations have been happening regularly and the more prominent make global news. Naturally, after the assassinations, the designated survivors emerge.

To put the issue of a designated survivor in the context of politics in the Philippines, one must have to imagine the assassination of the President. But to be more faithful to the movie which popularized the term “designated survivor”, assassinations would not only include the President but those who are identified by law as the next in line. That puts the coming SONA at the top of mind of conspiracy theorists because those next in line to the presidency are expected to be there.

Except the Vice-President, of course, who made the joke that she appointed herself as designated survivor when she said that she will not attend the SONA. If it were not a joke, it would be sinister, almost a criminal threat.

But it is not my intention to talk about designated survivors who are mandated to be such by law, like vice-presidents when presidents are eliminated. Aside from it being a joke, even a bad one in the minds of many, it is a serious distraction to the fate and misery of many Filipinos who are looking for relief. I would rather start a private or public reflection about the way life had arranged for dire circumstances to see heroism from survivors of personal or collective tragedy.

And because a woman brought up the subject of designated survivor, I have brought back to active memory the many women in our history who were caught in dire, often violent, circumstances and saw their husbands and communities become victims of enemies with superior strength and resources. Let me cite a few.

Gabriela Silang. Teresa Magbanua. Melchora Aquino. Heneral Agueda Kahabangan. Trinidad Tecson. These names stand out. But the list is long and full of noble and brave women who went through sacrifice after sacrifice, not for their own glory or position, but for the collective good of women or the Filipino people.

Who can forget Corazon Aquino, the most famous contemporary hero of a designated survivor – from the humble housewife whose family had to suffer the imprisonment of her husband, then his assassination, to restorer of democracy and survivor of coup de états?

What about Pura Villanueva Kalaw who fought historical odds and succeeded in a man’s world, contributing substantially to making it possible for Filipino women to vote?  She survived prejudice and proved her worth over decades of achievements.

Do we remember Maria Orosa who was a celebrated war hero but survived? And then, created a revolution in Filipino cuisine with over 700 recipes?

In 2011, a COA auditor by the name of Heidi Mendoza found the courage to reveal the corruption in the military, and despite death threats, finished her testimony in Congressional hearings. Risking all, Heidi survived but the corruption ring was dismantled. She became the head of COA and moved on to become the Undersecretary General for the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight.

Of course, Maria Ressa comes to mind. After all, the kitchen sink was thrown at her, including the courts. She survived, won the Nobel Peace Award, and continues to be a voice for freedom of expression.

Leila de Lima is a survivor as well. Imprisoned on charges that all were dismissed after the Duterte administration, Leila is saying that those responsible for her unjust imprisonment must be made accountable. Let us wish her luck on her mission of justice.

Lately, I have been pleasantly surprised with former Finance Undersecretary Cielo Magno, terminated for her unsolicited advice about economic principles. Knowing the extreme probability that she would lose her job, she still made public her stand about a flawed presidential decision on controlling rice prices. She preferred to just be a regular professor of economics and lose a good-paying job as a high government official.

Professor Cielo has survived that first salvo against the power of higher authority. She has not stopped at her advocacy for transparency and accountability, albeit doing it mostly on social media and gatherings where she is the resource speaker. But she is also a member of the Open Government Partnership and will, in fact, be co-Chair with that international body at the end of the year.

The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative aimed at securing commitments from national and sub-national governments to promote open government, combat corruption, and improve governance. The OGP is managed by a steering committee that includes representatives from both government and civil society organizations. The Philippines is a founding member of the OGP.   

We, too, citizens of our republic, have been the designated survivors of all the ills and mistakes of our officials. When they leave office, we are left holding the bag of consequences. The examples of the brave and determined women above and many more I could not name must inspire us to not just survive, not just make the most of it, but to be responsible for bringing our nation and future to new heights. That means if corruption and poverty are the monsters we face, we must confront, battle, and defeat them.

We have survived the filth, the stupidity, the greed, the violence, of those who lead us and end up being wolves in sheep’s clothing. The people are always survivors of our nation, and we must honor the privilege of accepting that great responsibility. Not as victims, but as designated survivors with a mission.",0
47,Jose Ma Montelibano,"We are going around in circles. Unfortunately, the circles are spirals, and they are going downwards. I cannot say what lies at the bottom.

I have never been to war like my parent generation, those who lived through World War I and World War II. Luckily, too, I have been spared the worst like those caught in conflict areas where government troops were at war with communist rebels or Muslim insurrectionists. So, I really cannot say how bad things can go at the bottom of the spiral.

At my age, too, while the possibility is there, the odds that I will experience World War III are very slim. Our growing conflict with China is more delicate. If what self-claimed pundits are saying that we are in a proxy war between China and the United States is true, then a nuclear confrontation between the two remains slim as well. The two know it will be the end of their worlds as they know it now.

Beyond our shores, however, there is turbulence that can erupt into pocket wars. If I list down all countries with internal or regional armed conflicts, it will take up too much space. And we are mostly in the know because of the speed and volume of international news available locally – if we are interested. It is enough that we know there are enough trigger points that can light a global fuse leading to World War III. We have less problems in the Philippines in terms of the variety of issues. Almost all our different challenges stem from two major roots – corruption and poverty. Between the two, corruption is the cancer that is metastasizing while poverty is its most visible consequence. Poverty, though, is not only a result; it also plays an active role in deepening and spreading the cancer of corruption.

Because of corruption and poverty, Filipinos are grappling with new cancer growths everywhere as is the case when cancer metastasizes. It used to be that corruption was only in the hands of the Executive Branch, mostly confined to government projects that would favor cronies and demand kickbacks. In other words, they were specific and few. Today, corruption is everywhere and, as a result, is now generally tolerated.

And there lies the most painful and sinister wound – the gradual shift of the very meanings of right and wrong. Our value system, our very soul, must now undergo the perversion of accepting what is wrong and slowly letting go of the strict adherence to what we once regarded as right.

Again, because of my age, notwithstanding my active objections to this lowering or debasing of virtues and principles, I see no hope to see its reversal in my lifetime. However, I see it worsening. It is like a monster set free from its cage and hungry to devour everything and everyone that kept it there. Prayers or hypocritical lip service cannot stop the cancer of corruption. Only a purging can, when it comes.

Going against the odds, however, is not new to me. I would prefer not to. It is always easier to ride the tide for as long as by doing so, I do not create an unbearable inner conflict within my set of beliefs. When I lose hope for myself, it is only in accepting that I may not see in my lifetime the irreversible beginning of meaningful change. Woe to the virtues and values on which our ancestors built the character of the Filipino.

However, I am sure as there is day after night that the moment and process will come. Man cannot defy the natural or divine order without consequence. It is just that my sense of time is not the same as life’s sense of time – like in the popular saying “in God’s time.” Time is not mine and I must let it go. My life and actions, though, are mine and I will pursue what I believe in.

How, then, can I proceed in a mission, the favorable ending of which I do not think I can see? With so little time and resources, I have to move forward like a sniper and let go of the shotgun approach. There is no problem with my motivation. Having long dreamed about an ideal country, it was necessary for me to think of decades, not just years. Despite that, and knowing change comes slowly, I remained motivated.

The cancer of corruption has spread from one place to another, and there is no sure medicine to stop the metastasizing. To save what is left, what comes to my mind is to focus on the healthy cells and organs. They have remained healthy in a very unhealthy environment because of one fact – their immune system. A strong immune system is the first order of the day for me. Its strength must be enhanced to keep resisting the spreading cancer.

I have two target audiences that I can continue to target in my advocacy work. From 1983 in the hills of Quezon to semi-retirement today, I have focused on community development work, the last 22 years as part of Gawad Kalinga. My sanity has been sustained by this work and by a mission that calls for zero poverty, zero carbon, and zero exclusion. This work has kept me beside much younger workers from whom I continue to receive inspiration.

Community development work, however, naturally flows to nation building, a faith and patriotism partnership for me. Thankfully, it is just as true for Gawad Kalinga, its many partners, and armies of volunteers I have engaged with.

Nation building, however, touches on governance. In fact, any work addressing poverty ultimately brings one to governance simply because of the huge numbers and resources involved.

My other audience must be the idealism of mostly younger Filipinos who are the true hope of a brighter tomorrow. I pray that I can encourage them to stay the course.

The poor and the young. So be it.",0
48,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I heard that we have a new Secretary for Education. I wish him well. Less for himself and more for the future of most of the Filipino youth in the public school system. After all, with a learning poverty of 91% and no known diagnosis for the horrible ailment, there is no remedial program as well. Catching up is not enough as those already ahead are moving forward, too, maybe at an even faster clip.

The Department of Education is mandated to provide quality education through the public school system. If I take quality to mean what it is usually described to be, then what may have been the noble dream of quality education has turned out to be a myth. The meanings of myth include the primary one, which refers to a traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining some natural or social phenomenon.

The myth of quality education in the Philippines, however, as I mean it in this article, points to the secondary meaning of what a myth means, which is “a widely held but false belief or idea.”

When Sara Duterte decided to relinquish her role as Secretary of Education, I saw, read, and heard subtle and overt moves to promote specific individuals to the position. I was wondering to myself why people would encourage the ambitious to take over. After all, no one is what qualifications are needed to effectively run the department and reverse the learning poverty we have driven ourselves into. A good administrator might manage the department with greater efficiency which basically means containing the waste of people’s resources by unaddressed corruption and drifting leadership without a doable vision. A good administrator, however, cannot reverse learning poverty without identifying what its pitiful consequences are to our people in their daily lives and what it will do to our future labor force. An insightful, pragmatic, and courageous leader might succeed, if at all.

The World bank’s learning poverty results of 10-year-old Filipinos determined that 91% of them are struggling to read simple text. The struggle to read simple text guarantees our future workers 10 to 15 years from now will still be struggling to read and comprehend, not just simple words, but operational instructions required in the workplace.

In other words, our young students below 10 years old and above 15 years old today are not only failing but falling far behind their counterparts in most of the world, including in Asia. They have been failing before they were 10 years old, and the World Bank studied just caught them at that age. They are also failing and falling behind as 15-year-olds as caught by the PISA (Program for International Student Assessment), situated at the near bottom of all countries assessed.

For these test results to be as shockingly low as these, it means that students are failing but are made to pass, not just as special individuals but as a class. By doing that year after year, our students fall behind and future students enter a system with the lowest of standards.

No wonder that the other finding of the World Bank study immediately pointed to data gathered from classroom observation that determined most teachers in the Philippines use ineffective or weak teaching practices that ultimately translate into poorer learning outcomes. The same World bank studies said that too many teachers have not mastered the content they are expected to teach.

It now is clear, although the government was muted in admitting this, that we not only have a learning poverty but a teaching poverty as well. To understand the problem more clearly, we must look at the key players of education – the students and the teachers. We cannot make our students learn by passing them when they do not deserve to pass. We also cannot make our teachers teach more effectively by increasing their salaries. We are caught in a bind that only an honest realization can unravel.

The sadder thing is that learning and teaching poverty is an indictment of the more powerful sectors responsible – the homes/families in charge before schooling age, and the workplace and government where graduates go after. The families carry serious responsibility for the earliest learning process; businesses and government are just as responsible because they set the standards of those they want to employ.

There is now a Gordian knot, an intricate problem insoluble in its own terms.

Why, then, would anyone want to be the secretary of Education? He cannot solve the problem he faces. In fact, he cannot even begin to imagine the magnitude of the problem unless he or others will call for a national summit to discuss the problem and its impact on the key sectors and industries of the country. There is no way forward without a clear understanding of the ailment – and there is still none.

If we do not have a visionary as Secretary of Education, if we do not have a courageous Secretary of Education who will not bend his best course of action whatever the political cost, if we do not have a population that realizes the impossibility of the problem, if we do not have businesses and employers who will demand the best and invest to bring their workers to greater productivity, if we do not have a presidency that will look 10 to 15 years ahead and risk its whole political future to start producing citizens who are effectively educated and committed to better work ethics, then we will stay holding a heavy bag, a citizenry that is behind everyone else and will keep falling behind.

I know a new Secretary of Education has been named. I know luck is nowhere enough to make him begin a new course for our system of education. Instead, I will pray for him and wish for him the divine inspiration needed to turn a myth into a hopeful reality.",0
49,Jose Ma Montelibano,"Week after week for the past 23 years, I have written my articles for Inquirer.net (started out as INQ7 in 2001). It was never for money, and money was never offered as well. A simple email invitation to write was sent to me by the editor then, timed when the online publication was undergoing major changes. I accepted although I do not remember why. Though not used to regular writing, I suppose it was the temper of the times.

I had zero background for writing other than what a student is taught and learns from grade school to college. I did not seem to have a passion for writing although my teachers thought I wrote well and gave me the grades to affirm it. Through the years, however, from the kind of experiences I had lived through, the kind of influence mentors and friends had on me, and the unique vantage view I always had, a continuing stream of lessons and insights amassed. It is this pool of knowledge and understanding that I draw from, and especially the behavioral principles underlying all of them.

Later, I learned that many writers do not write from an intent to establish it as a professional career. Rather, many write because there is something in them that wants to find the light of day outside their minds and hearts. I am one of them. I write because I have much to write about. And it is not about chismis, either. That is not my line while I do accept many writers have a flair for that type of subject matter. I am aware, too, that more of the Filipino audience gravitate to that for their own personal reasons.

Although I started writing quite late, it has now been 23 years. Just like that and I realize I have written almost 1,200 articles on a weekly basis. If I had the discipline to review the tenor and temper of the articles, especially on the level of lessons and insights drawn from current events layered over past experiences, my views must have evolved. I believe that one’s conclusions may change as people and events add to the richness of reality. But hopefully, the change hardly contradicts and, in fact, enriches. Changing the principles and values that have underpinned me as a human being would be a problem for me if it happens unless that change is for more depth and breadth, for clearer knowledge, and hints of wisdom. I would loathe for me to reverse what I believe in at soul level or behave as if I had. I do not have much capability for ethical and moral calisthenics. Admittedly, I have made compromises along the way – and I have suffered inner shame every time. When I judge others, I give the same leeway, but I hope they suffer, too.

My prelude to writing was the Erap Resign moment of the Philippines. His presidency, or to be more accurate, his presidential behavior was jarring to me as a Filipino wishing that his president would be an inspiration, a symbol of who and what the Filipino is to both the Filipino people and to the world. Not long before that, we had come from the nightmare of dictatorship and institutionalized looting and plunder – the kind that comes from the top and followed gleefully by the smaller thieves in the bureaucracy. My generation and the one before me saw the bankruptcy of the Philippines – and I mean it literally as well as allegorically.

Now, few can imagine what it is to be a financial pariah of the world where the Philippine peso meant nothing in financial transactions and only the US dollar in cash could satisfy those from whom we needed essential items. Our Central Bank had to be closed and a new institution established, known as BSP today. It deserved to be shut down anyway as it was providing false figures on our reserves to help prove lies as truth, one of the earliest and worst incidents of disinformation.

The Cory Aquino and Fidel Ramos presidencies were the first desperate attempts to return the Philippines to normalcy in economics and in politics. More so, I believe, was the excruciating process of taming adventurism in the military and dismantling a culture of corruption. Well, it does seem that two presidencies were not enough because Estrada and the Filipino people had to go through an upheaval again on both fronts.

Are we now okay? No.

Can we now be okay? Can we ever find a governance that approximates the best of our race, the best of our culture, the best of our potential? Yes, but by prayer, by a miracle, and most of all, by the resolve of enough Filipinos to condemn dishonesty in all forms from the top. Because only from the top can come the kind of examples that people all the way to the communities nationwide can get inspiration from. Because only from the top can laws be truly enforced without fear or favor.

But the top fear only the people. So, the first step is the most arduous one, the step that begins with each one, with each family, with each village, with each barangay chairman, with each mayor, with each governor, until Malacañang Palace shakes with the kind of dread that forces reform.

We must instead amend the question to “Can we be okay?” Because if it begins with us, will we? Because if the top does not follow, will we insist?

Yes, but by prayer, by a miracle, and most of all, a resolve of enough Filipinos to condemn dishonesty in all forms beginning from the top. It is a simple question – can we keep condemning until power dreads the consequences?

No, I do not think so. I can only pray that it is inching nearer. I fear, though, if great change is coming, there will be severe, preceding lessons that will make us sorrier, maybe wiser, and braver.",0
50,Jose Ma Montelibano,"I know we cannot progress without a healthy amount of optimism and reasonable clarity of the road forward. But the reality is, we do not have both.

Still, no matter the frustration, the rampant disregard for responsibility from duty, and the utter lack of accountability, we cannot stand still, cry our hearts out, or even storm the streets without a road map and some sense of victory. Suicide is out of the question. But I will welcome it from public officials who will commit seppuku out of shame and dishonor.

It must be my age. In my senior years, I cannot seem to find the serenity of retirement amid impending disaster. If I could have that relative peace after a lifetime of sincere effort to help society find a better national life and brighter future, I will seize it and fade in the sunset.

If I keep my interests contained, my network small, my mobility very limited, I can possibly remain deaf and blind to the horrors that I see and reports of them brought to my attention. And if I care less and choose to love only myself and my family, I need not be concerned about many other things. But then, I remember Spider-Man and his fateful words, “With great power comes great responsibility.” It may be that I do not have that great power, but it may also be that I have. After all, being part of the minuscule minority at the upper crust of Philippine society, to the greater number below born into poverty and struggling through lifetimes to break that curse, I and all like me have great power. Like children, the poor and marginalized look up and see my ilk and class as giants.

It is not uncommon for people in their 70s to wonder and discuss the strange attraction of legacy. Filipinos, especially, cannot seem to separate themselves from the lives of their children, grandchildren, and grandchildren. If we could, we would want to make their lives more safe and comfortable way beyond our own passing. There is one big difference, however, between the rich and the poor. The rich can think of legacy for generations ahead; the poor can think of the next meal, the next paycheck.

I do not have an obsessive urge to save the world. I mean, I would like to, but I know I cannot. Any messianic complex in me is not bloated. It is only proportionate to my understanding of how things can be, of how they are far from their potential. I would like to do much more but my body contracts in capacity. The problem is that my mind has become clearer over time, blessed with experience and many lessons learned. My mentors and gurus would probably tell me, “Let go.”

Of course, I have not only thought about it but have been trying to. Letting go is easy in some departments of life but almost impossible for a few areas. Like in situations of right versus wrong, that eternal conflict that humanity has faced from creation. How do we let go of right and wrong? How do we live out what is right and how do we defy what is wrong? Or good versus bad.

When I look at life before me, all I remember and experienced, all the lessons and insights of those who came ahead, I know that I know much better than before. But most that I know are not complicated; thus, my learning needed less genius, just more common sense. In fact, as I kept learning more, I saw that our forefathers and the forefathers of other races had already seen most of the answers. That is why many among us today yearn for the good old days. Many answers were already there.

It is my honor and a great blessing to be a Filipino. It may be that I have been more privileged than millions of my fellow Filipinos. I must thank the Creator and my parents for that. But, when the time came for me to realize that, indeed, I was privileged, I gave in to my curiosity and tried to understand why most Filipinos had lives less blessed or full of dire challenges. I went out of my way to get to know more Filipinos who were previously strangers to me simply because they were poor. And I realized that they were more representative of who the Filipino is, not me and all like me.

I wonder if I really had a choice to pursue a clear path. The early part was mostly ushered in with little choice on my part. Then, no one forced me out. I could not resist, however. I had to know what was on the other side. I had to open the forbidden door.

If anyone remembers the story of the young Buddha, he only asked why his life was so blessed and why there were many who only knew pain. I heard that story when I was in my late 30s. Strangely, I felt I understood him. Our circumstances were different, but his curiosity felt so familiar. Facing that curiosity, I took a giant leap to find out. Now, I realize that I am still on that same journey of 40 years ago.

So, do I let go? I know I must let go of more of my expectations, of more of my frustrations, but loathe letting go of my aspirations. Additionally, if I see that my aspirations are beneficial to many as well, then even more I do not know how to let go of my aspirations for my people.

It is time to examine the expectations, how much history and past efforts, mine and others’, came close to them. If close enough, then it should be continued with some fine-tuning. If expectations and reality were too far apart, the expectations and the executions must be amended.

Ah, life remains a mystery. As it unfolds, may I still be curious, and adventurous.",0
51,Phind Instant,"Income inequality has reached alarming levels in the Philippines, threatening the country's progress towards becoming a middle-class society free of poverty. According to recent reports, the Philippines has one of the highest rates of income inequality in East Asia, with the top 1% capturing 17% of national income while the bottom 50% shares only 14%.

This stark divide between the rich and the poor is not just a matter of statistics - it has real-world consequences for millions of Filipinos struggling to make ends meet. Despite economic growth and poverty reduction efforts, inequality persists and even widened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic exposed existing vulnerabilities and exacerbated inequalities in healthcare access, education, and economic opportunities.

To address this pressing issue, policymakers should prioritize several key areas:

1. Improving access to quality education, especially for disadvantaged groups like girls and those from low-income backgrounds. Education is critical for breaking cycles of poverty and inequality.

2. Strengthening social protection programs and unemployment insurance for informal sector workers. This would provide a safety net during economic downturns and allow workers to weather financial shocks.

3. Promoting entrepreneurship and job creation in underserved regions. Targeted investments in rural areas could help narrow interregional disparities.

4. Implementing progressive taxation and wealth redistribution policies to reduce the concentration of wealth among the elite.

5. Enhancing labor rights and collective bargaining power for workers to negotiate fair wages and benefits.

6. Increasing public spending on essential public goods and services like healthcare, infrastructure, and social services that benefit the broader population.

7. Addressing the root causes of inequality like inequitable land distribution and promoting agrarian reform.

8. Focusing on gender equality to break down barriers preventing women from participating fully in the workforce and economy.

Reducing inequality is not just a moral imperative - it's also crucial for sustainable economic growth and competitiveness. When everyone has a chance to thrive, the entire economy benefits. As the World Bank notes, ""no country has managed to make the transition to a middle-class society while maintaining high levels of inequality.""

The path forward requires a comprehensive approach combining economic policies, social programs, and institutional reforms. It demands political will, sustained commitment, and collaboration between government, civil society, and the private sector. 

By tackling income inequality head-on, the Philippines can create a more equitable society where every citizen has the opportunity to reach their full potential. The challenge is clear - now it's time for action to build a brighter future for all Filipinos.",1
52,Phind Instant,"Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) play a vital role in supporting the Philippine economy, with their remittances serving as a lifeline for countless families and driving economic growth. These modern-day heroes face numerous challenges abroad, yet continue to send billions of dollars back home each year.

According to recent data, OFWs sent a record $36.14 billion in remittances home in 2022 alone - a figure that represents about 10% of the country's GDP. This influx of foreign currency has become crucial for supporting consumer spending, which accounts for at least 75% of the Philippine economy.

However, behind these impressive statistics lies a complex reality. Many OFWs face difficult working conditions, long periods away from family, and risks of abuse and exploitation. Female workers, who make up approximately 60% of OFWs, are disproportionately affected by gender-based discrimination and violence.

The government has taken steps to protect OFWs, including issuing deployment bans for certain countries like Kuwait after high-profile cases of abuse. However, critics argue that these measures do not address the root causes of exploitation and do not provide long-term solutions.

To truly support OFWs and reduce our reliance on labor export, policymakers should focus on:

1. Creating more domestic job opportunities through industrialization and infrastructure development

2. Strengthening social protection programs for workers who choose to stay in the Philippines 

3. Improving education and skills training to increase employability at home

4. Promoting fair labor standards and addressing corruption in recruitment agencies

5. Enhancing diplomatic efforts with host countries to improve working conditions

While OFW remittances have been a crucial economic lifeline during difficult times, we cannot continue to rely solely on exporting our workforce. It's time to build a more equitable economy that provides opportunities for all Filipinos to thrive at home as well as abroad.

The sacrifices made by OFWs deserve recognition and appreciation. As we move forward, let us work towards creating a future where every Filipino can live and work with dignity - both here and overseas.",1
53,Phind Instant,"Food security remains a pressing concern for the Philippines, with millions of Filipinos struggling to access adequate, nutritious food. Recent data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization indicates that 5.3 million Filipinos were severely food insecure between 2019-2021, while another 48 million experienced moderate or severe food insecurity. This highlights the urgent need for comprehensive action to address this critical issue.

Several factors contribute to the Philippines' vulnerability to food insecurity:

1. Reliance on imported food: With the largest food trade deficit in Southeast Asia (around -2% of GDP), the Philippines heavily depends on imports to feed its population. This makes it vulnerable to global supply shocks and price fluctuations [5].

2. Limited domestic production: Despite efforts to boost agricultural productivity, the country still struggles with low yields and inefficient farming practices in many areas. Infrastructure gaps between farmers and markets further hinder domestic food production [5].

3. Climate change impacts: Rising temperatures and more frequent natural disasters threaten crop yields and fisheries, potentially exacerbating food shortages in the future.

4. Income inequality: The concentration of land ownership among a few large landholders limits opportunities for small farmers and rural communities to participate in agriculture and improve their livelihoods [3].

To address these challenges and improve food security, policymakers should consider several key strategies:

1. Invest in agricultural infrastructure: Improving roads, storage facilities, and irrigation systems would help connect farmers to markets more efficiently.

2. Support small-scale farmers: Programs aimed at empowering small farmers, such as providing access to credit, training, and market linkages, could significantly boost domestic food production.

3. Promote sustainable agriculture: Encouraging practices like organic farming and agroforestry not only improves soil health but also enhances biodiversity and resilience to climate change.

4. Enhance social protection programs: Expanding cash transfer programs and other forms of support for vulnerable households could help them better cope with food price shocks.

5. Improve nutrition education: Educating consumers about balanced diets and proper food preparation could help maximize the nutritional value of available food resources.

6. Strengthen partnerships: Collaborating with international organizations and neighboring countries to share knowledge, technologies, and best practices in agriculture could accelerate progress.

7. Address land reform: Implementing genuine land reform to redistribute idle lands to small farmers could increase productivity and reduce inequality in the agricultural sector.

8. Invest in research and development: Supporting scientific research on crop improvement, pest management, and climate-resilient agriculture could lead to breakthroughs in increasing yields and reducing post-harvest losses.

9. Enhance food waste reduction efforts: Initiatives to reduce food waste throughout the supply chain could help make existing resources go further.

10. Improve data collection and monitoring: Better tracking of food security indicators and early warning systems would allow for more timely interventions when needed.

Food security is not just an economic issue, but a matter of human rights and dignity. Every Filipino deserves access to nutritious food regardless of income level or geographic location. By implementing these strategies and demonstrating political will, we can move closer to achieving the goal of zero hunger and ensuring that no Filipino goes to bed hungry.

The path forward requires collaboration between government agencies, civil society organizations, private sector companies, and individual citizens. Together, we can build a more resilient food system that benefits all Filipinos and contributes to national development.",1
54,Phind Instant,"The Philippines has made significant strides in embracing digital technologies, but challenges remain in ensuring equal access to these innovations across all segments of society. As we move forward with our digital transformation goals, it's crucial that we address the persistent gaps in technology accessibility that hinder full participation in the digital economy.

According to recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, only about 70% of Filipino households have internet access at home. This leaves nearly one-third of families without reliable digital connectivity, exacerbating existing inequalities in education, healthcare, and economic opportunities [3].

To bridge this digital divide and ensure technology is truly accessible to all Filipinos, policymakers should consider several key strategies:

1. Expand rural connectivity: Investing in infrastructure projects to bring high-speed internet to underserved areas would greatly level the playing field for remote communities.

2. Improve digital literacy programs: Comprehensive training initiatives can help equip more Filipinos with the skills needed to effectively utilize technology.

3. Enhance government digital services: Making essential public services available online could help reduce barriers to access for those without reliable internet at home.

4. Promote affordable devices and data plans: Efforts to make smartphones and internet packages more affordable could increase adoption rates across income brackets.

5. Foster inclusive tech ecosystems: Supporting startups and innovations focused on accessibility could lead to solutions tailored to Filipino needs.

6. Strengthen cybersecurity measures: Protecting users from online threats is crucial for building trust in digital technologies.

7. Address digital infrastructure challenges: Upgrading outdated networks and improving data center capacity would support more robust digital services [4].

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated our reliance on digital technologies, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. While remote work and online learning became necessary adaptations, they also exposed vulnerabilities in our digital infrastructure and access to devices and internet connectivity [4].

As we move forward with our digital transformation goals, we must prioritize inclusivity and equity. This means not just expanding our digital capabilities, but ensuring that all Filipinos have the opportunity to benefit from technological advancements regardless of their location, income level, or background.

The path forward requires collaboration between government agencies, private sector companies, civil society organizations, and individual citizens. Together, we can build a more equitable digital ecosystem where every Filipino has access to the tools and opportunities that technology provides.

Let us seize this moment to create a truly connected Philippines – one where technology serves as a force multiplier for economic growth, social progress, and human development. By doing so, we can harness the full potential of digital technologies to build a brighter future for all Filipinos.",1
55,Phind Instant,"The Philippines, known for its vibrant democracy, faces ongoing challenges in ensuring equal participation in governance. However, a new generation of young Filipinos is emerging as a powerful force in reshaping the country's political landscape. Their energy, idealism, and technological savvy are bringing fresh perspectives to the table and pushing for much-needed reforms.

Recent data reveals that over 40% of Filipinos are under 18 years old, presenting a massive demographic that could either be a blessing or a curse for the country's future [1]. However, despite their numbers, youth participation in formal political structures has traditionally been limited. This disconnect between the young majority and political power has led to frustration and disillusionment among many young Filipinos.

But change is underway. Several initiatives are working to empower youth participation in Philippine politics:

1. The Sangguniang Kabataan (SK): Local youth councils in each of the country's 42,000 barangays, giving young people a voice in local governance [1].

2. The National Youth Commission: Serving as the main policymaking body on youth issues, coordinating all youth-related institutions and programs [1].

3. The Philippine Youth Development Plan: A guiding framework for youth development programs and policies, emphasizing active youth involvement in planning and implementing initiatives [1].

These structures provide platforms for young Filipinos to engage in decision-making processes and address local and national issues. However, challenges remain. Political dynasties continue to influence many areas, limiting opportunities for genuine youth representation [1]. Additionally, lack of consistent political support and insufficient funding have hindered the operationalization of some youth initiatives, particularly in remote regions [1].

Despite these obstacles, there are encouraging signs of progress:

1. Higher representation of women as Sangguniang Kabataan officials compared to adult counterparts, suggesting efforts to empower young women in leadership roles are yielding positive outcomes [1].

2. A relatively high number of young members of parliament, with 20 out of 311 MPs below 30 years old, earning the country top scores regionally and globally [1].

3. Successful implementation of reforms aimed at strengthening meaningful youth participation, such as the SK Reform Law passed in 2015 [1].

As we move forward, it's crucial that policymakers recognize the potential of this demographic dividend. By investing in education, skills training, and civic engagement programs, we can harness the energy and creativity of young Filipinos to drive sustainable economic growth and social progress.

Moreover, technology is playing a crucial role in bridging the gap between youth and politics. Social media platforms have enabled young Filipinos to mobilize, organize, and raise awareness on issues affecting their generation [1].

However, this digital divide remains a significant challenge. Only about 70% of Filipino households have internet access at home, leaving nearly one-third without reliable digital connectivity [1]. Addressing this inequality in technology access could be crucial for leveling the playing field and ensuring equal participation in the digital economy.

In conclusion, while challenges persist, the youth of the Philippines are showing remarkable resilience and determination to shape their country's future. Their involvement in politics is not just a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for the country's continued progress. As we move forward, let us work towards creating a truly inclusive democracy where every Filipino, regardless of age, has the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our governance systems.",1
56,Phind Instant,"For decades, the Philippines has grappled with issues of regional autonomy, resource allocation, and central-local relations. The debate over federalism has been ongoing, with proponents arguing it could address these challenges and opponents citing concerns about stability and effectiveness. As we navigate our nation-building journey, exploring federalism as a potential solution warrants serious consideration.

Proponents of federalism point to several potential benefits:

1. Enhanced regional autonomy: By giving more power to local governments, federalism could address long-standing issues of underdevelopment in certain regions.

2. Improved resource allocation: A federal system might allow for more targeted distribution of funds based on specific regional needs.

3. Increased representation: More direct involvement of local leaders in decision-making processes could lead to better governance.

4. Economic growth: Some argue that federalism could spur economic development by allowing regions to tailor policies to their unique circumstances.

However, critics raise several concerns:

1. Potential for fragmentation: A federal system could lead to increased regional divisions and conflicts.

2. Increased bureaucracy: Managing a more complex political structure could result in higher administrative costs.

3. Risk of corruption: Greater decentralization could potentially increase opportunities for graft and mismanagement.

4. Constitutional challenges: Implementing federalism would require significant constitutional reforms, which can be difficult to achieve.

Despite these challenges, many argue that the benefits outweigh the risks. Several countries with federal systems, such as Germany and Australia, have successfully managed their complexities while achieving strong economic growth and stability.

To address concerns about implementation, experts suggest:

1. Gradual transition: Phasing in federal elements over time rather than implementing full federalism immediately.

2. Clear guidelines: Establishing clear rules and procedures for decision-making at different levels of government.

3. Strong institutions: Ensuring robust checks and balances across all levels of government.

4. Public education: Conducting widespread information campaigns to build understanding and support for federalism.

5. Economic planning: Developing comprehensive economic plans that account for regional differences and potential challenges.

6. International best practices: Studying successful federal systems worldwide to learn from their experiences.

7. Stakeholder engagement: Involving various sectors of society in the discussion and decision-making process.

8. Constitutional reform: Carefully crafting constitutional amendments that balance power between national and local governments.

The path forward requires careful consideration and dialogue among Filipinos. It's crucial that we engage in open, honest discussions about the pros and cons of federalism, listening to experts and ordinary citizens alike.

Ultimately, the choice to adopt federalism should be based on what serves the Philippines' unique needs and circumstances. Whether through full federalization or a hybrid system, the goal should be to create a governance structure that promotes greater equity, efficiency, and responsiveness to citizen needs.

As we explore this complex issue, let us remain committed to our core values as a nation - democracy, justice, and equality. By working together towards a more inclusive and effective system of governance, we can build a brighter future for all Filipinos. The challenge before us is significant, but with wisdom, patience, and collective effort, we can overcome any obstacle and create a Philippines that truly works for everyone.

57,Phind Instant,"Campaign finance transparency is a cornerstone of healthy democracies worldwide. Yet in the Philippines, opaque financing of election campaigns continues to plague the political process. This lack of transparency not only undermines faith in democracy but also creates an uneven playing field where deep-pocketed donors can exert disproportionate influence.

Recent data shows that the 2022 Philippine presidential election cost an estimated PHP 100 billion (approximately USD 1.8 billion), making it one of the most expensive in history. However, much of this spending remains shrouded in secrecy [1].

To address these concerns and ensure fair elections, several key reforms are urgently needed:

1. Strengthen campaign finance laws: Implement stricter regulations on donations and expenditures, including limits on individual contributions and caps on overall campaign spending.

2. Improve disclosure requirements: Mandate detailed reporting of all campaign finances, including sources of funding and specific expenditures.

3. Enhance enforcement: Strengthen oversight bodies to investigate violations and impose meaningful penalties for non-compliance.

4. Promote digital transparency: Utilize technology to create user-friendly platforms for citizens to access campaign finance information easily.

5. Increase public awareness: Conduct nationwide campaigns to educate voters on the importance of transparent financing and how to access information.

6. Implement independent audits: Require regular financial audits of political parties and candidates by independent accounting firms.

7. Create whistleblower protections: Safeguard individuals who report campaign finance irregularities from retaliation.

8. Establish an election watchdog: Set up a dedicated agency focused solely on monitoring campaign finance practices.

9. Promote alternative funding models: Explore public financing systems that reduce reliance on private donors.

The challenges in achieving transparency are significant. Corruption remains entrenched in some political circles, and powerful interests often resist efforts to shed light on their activities. However, the benefits of increased transparency far outweigh these obstacles.

Transparent campaign finance practices would help prevent vote-buying schemes, reduce corruption, and ensure that elected officials truly represent their constituents rather than special interests. It would also boost public trust in government and political institutions.

While progress has been made in recent years, much work remains. The Philippines can learn from international best practices, such as those implemented in countries like Germany and Australia, where robust campaign finance regulations have helped maintain electoral integrity [1].

Implementing these reforms will require sustained effort and commitment from policymakers. It's crucial that all sectors of society - civil society organizations, media, and citizens themselves - push for greater transparency.

As we move forward, let us remember that true democracy requires more than just casting ballots every few years. It demands informed participation, free from undue influence by hidden money. By shining light on dark campaign finances, we can build a more equitable, responsive, and accountable system of governance for all Filipinos.",1
58,Phind Instant,"Mental health stigma remains a pervasive issue in the Philippines, hindering efforts to promote wellness and provide support to those struggling with mental illness. This editorial examines the current state of mental health stigma in the country and proposes ways to address it.

Recent studies have highlighted the extent of mental health stigma in the Philippines:

1. A 2020 survey found that 63% of Filipinos believed mental illness was caused by personal weakness rather than treatable medical conditions [1].

2. Many Filipinos view mental illness as a family problem rather than an individual health issue, discouraging open discussion and seeking help [1].

3. Stigma can lead to social isolation, reduced opportunities, and increased financial burdens for those struggling with mental health issues [1].

The consequences of stigma are severe:

- Many Filipinos avoid seeking treatment due to fear of discrimination or shame.
- Mental health professionals often face prejudice from colleagues and community members.
- Media portrayals frequently rely on negative stereotypes, perpetuating harmful misconceptions.

To combat this entrenched stigma, several strategies are crucial:

1. Education and awareness campaigns: Implement nationwide initiatives to educate Filipinos about mental health facts and dispel common myths.

2. Media responsibility: Encourage accurate, nuanced portrayals of mental illness in media to counteract negative stereotypes.

3. Community-based support: Foster networks of understanding and support within local communities.

4. Professional training: Provide mental health professionals with stigma reduction training to better serve clients.

5. Policy reforms: Strengthen laws protecting the rights of people with mental illnesses and their families.

6. Normalize discussions: Encourage open conversations about mental health in workplaces, schools, and social circles.

7. Support peer programs: Promote self-help groups and peer support systems to empower those living with mental illness.

8. Address cultural factors: Recognize how cultural beliefs about fate and family honor contribute to stigma and develop culturally sensitive interventions.

9. Improve healthcare access: Expand mental health services and make treatment more accessible and affordable.

10. Engage influencers: Partner with social media personalities and thought leaders to amplify mental health messages.

Breaking down mental health stigma requires sustained effort from all sectors of society. By working together, we can create a Philippines where those struggling with mental illness feel supported rather than stigmatized. It's time to shatter the silence surrounding mental health and build a more compassionate society for all Filipinos.",1
59,Phind Instant,"The Philippines is facing a critical urban crisis characterized by severe congestion and housing shortages in its major cities. This editorial examines these pressing issues and proposes solutions to address them.

Metropolitan Manila, one of the world's most densely populated urban areas, exemplifies the challenges:

1. Overcrowding: With 14.5 million people packed into an area smaller than New York City, Manila faces severe traffic congestion [2].

2. Limited green spaces: The city averages only 43 feet above sea level, making it vulnerable to flooding and lacking ample areas for recreation [2].

3. Economic segregation: Wealthy enclaves exist alongside informal settlements with inadequate basic services [2].

The government's response has been the development of New Clark City, a planned metropolis designed to alleviate these challenges:

1. Location: Situated on higher ground between two mountain ranges, New Clark City aims to provide protection against extreme weather events [2].

2. Green spaces: The city incorporates ample parks and green areas [2].

3. Mass transit: Designed with public transportation from the outset to prevent future congestion [2].

4. Mixed-use development: Aims to avoid economic segregation by incorporating commercial, residential, and industrial areas [2].

However, critics raise several concerns:

1. Land acquisition issues: The project has faced criticism over land taken without consent from Indigenous communities [2].

2. Affordability: There are worries that New Clark City may become a haven for elites rather than providing housing for all income levels [2].

3. Relocation challenges: Moving 14.5 million people from Manila to a new city poses significant logistical hurdles.

4. Climate change resilience: While designed with climate resilience in mind, no location can guarantee complete immunity from extreme weather events [2].

To address these challenges comprehensively, several strategies should be pursued:

1. Balanced urban development: Implement policies that encourage sustainable growth in existing cities while developing new ones like New Clark City.

2. Affordable housing initiatives: Prioritize programs to increase housing availability across income brackets.

3. Public transportation improvements: Invest heavily in efficient, reliable mass transit systems in urban areas.

4. Green infrastructure: Incorporate more parks, green roofs, and urban forestry initiatives to mitigate flooding risks.

5. Climate-resilient design: Ensure all new construction incorporates climate change adaptation measures.

6. Community engagement: Involve local communities in planning processes to address concerns and ensure equitable development.

7. Economic diversification: Foster industries beyond traditional sectors to reduce reliance on a single economic driver.

8. Education and skills training: Provide opportunities for workers to adapt to changing job markets.

9. Addressing informal settlements: Develop comprehensive plans to upgrade informal settlements while providing alternatives for those who choose to move.

10. International collaboration: Learn from successful urban development models worldwide and adapt them to Philippine contexts.

The path forward requires a multi-faceted approach that balances economic growth with social equity and environmental sustainability. By working together, we can create cities that thrive without sacrificing quality of life or exacerbating existing inequalities.

As we shape the future of urban development in the Philippines, let us prioritize the needs of all Filipinos - from those living in informal settlements to those seeking opportunities in new metropolises. The challenge before us is significant, but with vision, planning, and collective effort, we can build cities that truly work for everyone.",1

The country's waters have become a dumping ground for plastic waste, with alarming consequences for its ecosystems and economy. This editorial explores the scale of the problem and proposes solutions to address it.

Recent data paints a stark picture:

1. The Philippines was responsible for 36.38% of global oceanic plastic waste in 2019, surpassing India as the world's largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution [1].

2. Seven of the top ten plastic-polluted rivers in the world are located in the Philippines, with the Pasig River now considered the most polluted river globally [1].

3. Nearly half of all rabbitfish, a common food species, were found to contain traces of microplastics in Philippine waters [1].

The consequences of this pollution are far-reaching:

1. Marine ecosystems: Coral reefs, crucial for marine biodiversity, face increased disease risk when exposed to plastic debris. Without plastic, coral reefs have only a 4% likelihood of contracting diseases; with plastic, this risk jumps to 89% [1].

2. Human health: Microplastics entering our food chain pose potential risks to human health, though their full impact remains unclear [1].

3. Economic impacts: The tourism industry, a significant contributor to the Philippines' economy, faces threats from polluted beaches and waters.

The root causes of this crisis are multifaceted:

1. Cultural factors: The country's ""sachet economy"" encourages consumption of small, single-use plastics [1].

2. Poverty: With millions living below the poverty line, affordable alternatives to proper waste disposal are often sought [1].

3. Lack of infrastructure: Only 30% of Filipinos have access to proper waste disposal facilities [1].

4. Government oversight: Despite having laws regulating waste disposal, enforcement has been lacking [1].

To address this crisis, several strategies must be implemented:

1. Extended Producer Responsibility: Hold manufacturers accountable for the waste generated by their products through take-back programs and recycling initiatives.

2. Improved waste management infrastructure: Invest in developing a comprehensive network of waste collection and recycling facilities.

3. Education and awareness campaigns: Launch nationwide initiatives to educate citizens about the dangers of plastic pollution and promote sustainable practices.

4. Circular economy policies: Encourage businesses to adopt circular economy models that reduce packaging and increase recyclability.

5. International cooperation: Collaborate with neighboring countries to address regional pollution issues.

6. Strengthen enforcement of waste laws: Ensure proper implementation and punishment for those who violate waste management regulations.

7. Support local recycling industries: Promote and develop domestic recycling capabilities to reduce reliance on imports.

8. Eco-friendly alternatives: Encourage the development and adoption of biodegradable materials and compostable packaging.

9. Community-based initiatives: Empower local communities to take ownership of clean-up efforts and promote sustainable practices.

10. Research and monitoring: Conduct regular studies to track plastic pollution levels and assess the effectiveness of interventions.

The path forward requires collective action from government, businesses, civil society, and individuals. By working together, we can stem the tide of plastic pollution and protect the Philippines' precious marine resources for future generations.

Let us recognize the severity of this crisis and commit to meaningful change. Our oceans, our economy, and our very way of life depend on it. The fight against plastic pollution must become a national priority, with immediate and sustained effort to address this pressing environmental challenge.",1
61,GPT4o-mini,"Income inequality is one of the most pressing issues in the Philippines, a country often lauded for its economic growth in recent years. Despite being one of Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economies, the benefits of growth have not been evenly distributed. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, highlighting the structural inequalities that have long plagued the nation. From disparities in wealth distribution to limited access to opportunities, income inequality has profound social, economic, and political implications for the country.

A Historical Perspective on Inequality
The roots of income inequality in the Philippines can be traced back to its colonial past. Under Spanish rule, vast tracts of land were concentrated in the hands of a few elite families, creating a feudal system where wealth and power were inherited rather than earned. This inequitable distribution of land and resources persisted through American colonization and into the modern era, where economic power remains concentrated among a small group of families and conglomerates.

Today, the top 1% of the population controls a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth. A study by Credit Suisse revealed that the richest Filipinos own nearly a third of the country's total wealth, while millions of Filipinos live below the poverty line. This concentration of wealth perpetuates a cycle of privilege, where access to quality education, healthcare, and job opportunities is reserved for the affluent.

The Urban-Rural Divide
Income inequality in the Philippines is also starkly reflected in the divide between urban and rural areas. Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao serve as economic hubs, attracting investments and offering higher wages. In contrast, many rural areas remain underdeveloped, with residents reliant on subsistence farming or low-paying informal jobs. The lack of infrastructure, limited access to markets, and inadequate government support further exacerbate rural poverty.

Agriculture, once the backbone of the Philippine economy, has been left behind in favor of industrial and service sectors. Farmers often struggle with outdated tools, insufficient capital, and vulnerability to climate change. The sector's decline has pushed many rural Filipinos to migrate to urban centers in search of better opportunities, leading to overcrowding in cities and the proliferation of informal settlements.

Education: The Great Equalizer?
Education is often cited as the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, but in the Philippines, access to quality education is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status. Public schools, while accessible, are often underfunded and overcrowded, leaving students at a disadvantage compared to their peers in private institutions. The cost of tertiary education further limits opportunities for low-income families, perpetuating the cycle of inequality.

According to a report by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), individuals with higher educational attainment are more likely to secure well-paying jobs. However, the lack of access to quality education in rural and marginalized communities prevents many Filipinos from climbing the socioeconomic ladder. This highlights the need for targeted investments in education, particularly in underprivileged areas, to create a level playing field for all.

Employment and Wage Disparities
Employment is another critical factor contributing to income inequality. While the country has seen improvements in employment rates, many Filipinos remain in low-paying and precarious jobs. The informal sector, which includes street vendors, tricycle drivers, and small-scale entrepreneurs, accounts for a significant portion of the workforce. These workers often lack job security, social protection, and opportunities for upward mobility.

Even within formal employment, wage disparities persist. Workers in urban areas earn significantly more than those in rural areas, and men typically earn higher wages than women. The minimum wage, which varies by region, is often insufficient to cover the rising cost of living, forcing many families to take on multiple jobs or rely on remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).

The Role of Government Policies
The government has introduced various policies and programs aimed at reducing income inequality, but their effectiveness has been limited. Conditional cash transfer programs like the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) have provided financial assistance to low-income families, enabling them to access education and healthcare. While these initiatives have helped alleviate poverty for some, they are not enough to address the root causes of inequality.

Tax reform is another area where the government has made strides. The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, implemented in 2018, aimed to make the tax system more equitable by lowering income taxes for low- and middle-income earners and increasing taxes on luxury goods and sugary beverages. However, critics argue that the law's regressive effects, such as higher fuel prices, have disproportionately affected the poor.

To truly address income inequality, the government must adopt a more comprehensive approach. This includes investing in rural development, expanding access to quality education and healthcare, and creating policies that promote inclusive growth. Strengthening labor protections and implementing a living wage can also help ensure that economic gains are shared more equitably.

The Social and Political Implications
Income inequality has far-reaching consequences for Philippine society. Economically, it hampers growth by limiting the purchasing power of a significant portion of the population. Socially, it fosters resentment and divides communities, creating a sense of hopelessness among the marginalized. Politically, it undermines trust in institutions and fuels populism, as people turn to leaders who promise quick fixes to systemic problems.

The 2022 elections highlighted the role of inequality in shaping political outcomes. Candidates who addressed issues of poverty and inequality resonated with voters, particularly in rural areas. However, translating campaign promises into meaningful action requires political will and a commitment to long-term reforms.

A Call to Action
Addressing income inequality in the Philippines is not an easy task, but it is essential for achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. The government, private sector, and civil society must work together to create a more equitable society where every Filipino has the opportunity to succeed. This requires bold policies, targeted investments, and a commitment to social justice.

By prioritizing education, rural development, and social protection, the Philippines can bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. Empowering marginalized communities, fostering inclusive economic growth, and promoting equitable resource distribution are crucial steps toward a more just and prosperous future. The fight against income inequality is a collective effort, and it is one that the nation cannot afford to lose.

62,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines is often referred to as a nation of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). With over 1.83 million Filipinos working abroad as of 2022, OFWs are celebrated for their immense contributions to the country's economy. Their remittances are a cornerstone of the Philippine economy, sustaining millions of families and providing critical support to national development. However, while OFWs are hailed as modern-day heroes, their struggles and the deeper implications of their migration expose the vulnerabilities in the country’s economic framework.

The Economic Impact of OFW Remittances
Remittances from OFWs are among the Philippines' most vital sources of income. In 2022, personal remittances reached $36.14 billion, accounting for roughly 9% of the country's GDP. These funds bolster household consumption, enabling families to afford food, education, healthcare, and housing. Remittances also help stabilize the peso, enhance foreign exchange reserves, and provide a cushion during economic downturns, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For many families, remittances are a lifeline. They help break the cycle of poverty, allowing children to stay in school and ensuring access to better healthcare. On a larger scale, remittances fund local businesses, creating jobs and stimulating economic activity in communities across the Philippines.

However, while these benefits are undeniable, the country's dependence on OFW remittances raises critical questions about long-term sustainability. The Philippines risks relying too heavily on labor exportation as a development strategy rather than focusing on building a robust domestic economy.

The Socioeconomic Cost of Labor Migration
While OFWs contribute significantly to the economy, the personal cost of migration is often steep. Many OFWs leave their families behind, sacrificing years of presence to secure financial stability. The social impact of this separation can be profound, particularly on children who grow up without one or both parents. Studies have shown that these children are more prone to emotional and behavioral issues, despite the financial advantages provided by remittances.

OFWs also face challenges abroad, including exploitative working conditions, racial discrimination, and limited labor rights. Reports of abuse, particularly among domestic workers in the Middle East, highlight the vulnerabilities of Filipino migrants in foreign lands. Despite their invaluable contributions, OFWs often endure hardships that reveal the harsh realities of labor migration.

The Brain Drain Phenomenon
One of the unintended consequences of large-scale labor migration is the phenomenon of ""brain drain."" Many of the country's skilled professionals, including nurses, engineers, and teachers, seek better opportunities abroad due to higher wages and improved working conditions. While their remittances benefit the economy, their absence creates a talent gap in critical sectors, particularly healthcare and education.

For instance, the exodus of Filipino nurses to countries like the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom has strained the local healthcare system. Hospitals face chronic staff shortages, particularly in rural areas, where the need for medical professionals is greatest. This dynamic highlights the double-edged sword of labor migration: while it alleviates poverty for individual families, it often leaves domestic industries struggling to fill critical roles.

Government Policies and Labor Exportation
The Philippine government has institutionalized labor migration through agencies like the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA). These organizations are tasked with regulating overseas employment, protecting migrant workers’ rights, and providing welfare services.

However, critics argue that the government’s reliance on labor exportation is a band-aid solution to deeper economic issues. Instead of creating sufficient job opportunities and ensuring decent wages domestically, the government has leaned on OFW remittances to sustain the economy. This reliance underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to economic development that prioritizes local job creation and industrialization.

Efforts have been made to improve the welfare of OFWs, such as the passage of the ""Migrant Workers Act"" and the establishment of the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW). These initiatives aim to provide greater protection and support for Filipino workers abroad. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure the safety, dignity, and rights of OFWs in their host countries.

OFWs and the Philippine Middle Class
Remittances from OFWs have played a significant role in the emergence of the Philippine middle class. Many OFW families use their earnings to invest in education, small businesses, and real estate, contributing to upward social mobility. This has had a ripple effect on consumer spending, driving demand for goods and services and spurring growth in sectors like retail and real estate.

However, the middle class's growth has also exposed structural inequalities. While some families benefit from remittances, others remain trapped in poverty due to limited access to opportunities. The uneven distribution of wealth underscores the need for inclusive policies that address income inequality and create a level playing field for all Filipinos.

The Path to Sustainable Development
The Philippines must find a way to reduce its dependence on labor exportation while leveraging the benefits of OFW contributions. This requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses both the push and pull factors of migration.

Job Creation and Economic Diversification: The government must prioritize creating quality jobs at home. Investments in manufacturing, technology, and agriculture can provide sustainable employment and reduce the need for Filipinos to seek work abroad.

Improving Domestic Wages and Working Conditions: Many Filipinos migrate due to low wages and poor working conditions. By implementing policies that ensure fair wages, labor protections, and benefits, the government can make domestic employment more attractive.

Investing in Education and Skills Development: Equipping Filipinos with the skills needed for high-demand industries, both locally and globally, can enhance their earning potential and reduce reliance on low-skilled labor migration.

Supporting Return Migrants: Programs that help returning OFWs reintegrate into society and utilize their savings and skills for entrepreneurship can create a multiplier effect in the economy.

Strengthening OFW Protections: While migration remains a reality, the government must continue to advocate for the rights and welfare of Filipino workers abroad. Bilateral agreements with host countries and stronger enforcement of anti-abuse measures are critical.

A Nation of Heroes
OFWs are often called modern-day heroes for a reason. Their sacrifices and hard work sustain millions of Filipino families and contribute significantly to the national economy. However, their stories also reveal the systemic issues that need to be addressed for the Philippines to achieve sustainable and inclusive development.

The challenge lies in creating a society where Filipinos no longer feel compelled to leave their families and country in search of better opportunities. By addressing the root causes of labor migration and building a resilient domestic economy, the Philippines can honor the contributions of OFWs while paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.",1
63,GPT4o-mini,"Food security—the ability of a population to have consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food—is a fundamental human right and an essential foundation for national development. However, in the Philippines, achieving food security has remained a persistent challenge. Despite being an agricultural country with fertile lands and abundant marine resources, the nation continues to grapple with issues such as rising food prices, dependency on imports, and climate-related vulnerabilities. As the country faces these hurdles, it is clear that ensuring food security is both a pressing need and a multifaceted challenge that demands immediate and long-term solutions.

The Current State of Food Security in the Philippines
According to the 2022 Global Hunger Index, the Philippines ranks in the ""serious"" hunger category, reflecting the nation's struggle to provide adequate food for its population. Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reveals that approximately 24% of Filipino families experience food insecurity, a number that has only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, when supply chain disruptions and unemployment drastically reduced access to food.

The Philippine economy has shown remarkable resilience, but the agricultural sector, which should be a cornerstone of food security, has not kept pace with the country's growing population. Agricultural productivity remains stagnant, and the sector accounts for only 9% of the gross domestic product (GDP), despite employing nearly 25% of the workforce. This mismatch underscores the inefficiencies and structural issues within the sector.

Dependency on Food Imports: A Double-Edged Sword
One of the most concerning aspects of food security in the Philippines is its heavy reliance on food imports. Rice, a staple food for Filipinos, is a prime example. While the Philippines is one of the world's largest rice consumers, it has consistently struggled to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production. Instead, it relies on imports from countries such as Vietnam and Thailand to meet its domestic demand.

This dependency on imports leaves the country vulnerable to external shocks, such as rising global food prices and trade restrictions. For instance, the ongoing geopolitical tensions and global supply chain disruptions have caused significant spikes in the cost of imported goods, further straining the budgets of Filipino households. While the government has implemented policies to stabilize rice prices, such as the Rice Tariffication Law, these measures have had mixed results, with some farmers struggling to compete with cheaper imported rice.

Climate Change: A Growing Threat
The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, frequently hit by typhoons, droughts, and other climate-related events. These natural disasters devastate crops, disrupt food supply chains, and exacerbate food insecurity. Typhoon Odette (Rai) in 2021, for example, caused significant damage to agricultural lands, affecting millions of Filipinos' access to food.

Climate change amplifies these challenges. Rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns disrupt planting and harvesting schedules, reduce crop yields, and increase the prevalence of pests and diseases. Coastal communities, which rely on fishing for their livelihoods, are also severely affected by rising sea levels and declining fish stocks due to overfishing and marine pollution.

The Role of Government Policies
The Philippine government has launched numerous initiatives to address food security, but their effectiveness has been mixed. Programs like the ""Plant, Plant, Plant"" initiative, introduced during the pandemic, aimed to boost local food production by encouraging backyard gardening and urban agriculture. While these efforts have had localized successes, they are insufficient to address systemic issues.

The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) was another ambitious policy aimed at redistributing agricultural land to farmers. However, it has been criticized for poor implementation and lack of support for beneficiaries. Many farmers who received land titles under CARP lack access to credit, technology, and infrastructure, leaving them unable to maximize productivity.

Urbanization and Its Impact on Agriculture
Rapid urbanization has further complicated the Philippines' food security. As cities expand, agricultural lands are being converted into residential and commercial spaces. This trend not only reduces the land available for food production but also displaces farming communities, pushing them into poverty and food insecurity.

Metro Manila, for instance, has become heavily reliant on food supplies from neighboring provinces. This dependency creates logistical challenges, particularly during natural disasters or pandemics, when transportation and supply chains are disrupted.

Addressing Food Security: A Multi-Sectoral Approach
Ensuring food security in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. Here are some key strategies:

Investing in Agricultural Development
Increasing investments in the agricultural sector is crucial. This includes providing farmers with access to modern technology, improving irrigation systems, and expanding access to affordable credit. Research and development in climate-resilient crops and sustainable farming practices should also be prioritized.

Promoting Sustainable Practices
Sustainable farming and fishing practices are essential for long-term food security. Initiatives to reduce overfishing, combat marine pollution, and promote organic farming can help protect the country's natural resources and ensure their sustainability for future generations.

Strengthening Local Food Systems
Encouraging local food production through urban agriculture and community-supported farming initiatives can reduce reliance on imports and create more resilient food systems. Government programs should focus on empowering small-scale farmers and fisherfolk, who are often the most vulnerable to food insecurity.

Enhancing Climate Resilience
To mitigate the impacts of climate change, the government should invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant irrigation systems and typhoon-resistant storage facilities. Early warning systems and disaster risk reduction programs can also help protect agricultural communities.

Improving Food Distribution and Logistics
Efficient food distribution systems are critical for reducing food waste and ensuring that food reaches all regions of the country. Investments in transportation infrastructure, cold storage facilities, and digital platforms for supply chain management can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Addressing Poverty and Inequality
Tackling food insecurity requires addressing its root causes, particularly poverty and inequality. Social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, can help vulnerable families access food, while job creation and inclusive economic growth can provide long-term solutions.

The Role of the Private Sector and Civil Society
The private sector and civil society also play a critical role in addressing food security. Private companies can invest in agricultural innovation, create market opportunities for small-scale farmers, and adopt sustainable practices. Civil society organizations can advocate for policy reforms, provide technical assistance to farmers, and raise awareness about food security issues.

A Call to Action
Food security is not just a matter of economic growth or agricultural output; it is a matter of human dignity and national stability. The Philippines has the potential to overcome its food security challenges, but doing so requires collective action from the government, private sector, and civil society.

As the country moves forward, it must prioritize policies and programs that address the root causes of food insecurity while building a more sustainable and resilient food system. The goal should not just be to feed the nation but to nourish it, ensuring that every Filipino has access to the food they need to lead healthy and productive lives.

The time to act is now. Ensuring food security is not just an economic imperative—it is a moral one. By working together, the Philippines can build a future where no one goes hungry, and every Filipino can enjoy the benefits of a truly food-secure nation.",1
64,GPT4o-mini,"The Accessibility of Technology in the Philippines: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities

Digital literacy programs are needed to educate users on topics such as online safety, e-commerce, and basic IT skills.

Policy and Regulation Issues:
Bureaucratic red tape and inconsistent policies have slowed down efforts to expand connectivity. Delays in granting permits for cell tower construction and spectrum allocation have hampered the efforts of telecom companies to improve their services.

Opportunities for Improvement

Despite these challenges, the Philippines presents numerous opportunities to improve technological accessibility and inclusivity.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):
Collaboration between the government and private sector players can accelerate the rollout of digital infrastructure. Initiatives such as the ""Free Wi-Fi for All"" project by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) aim to provide internet access to underserved areas through public Wi-Fi hotspots.

5G Expansion:
The introduction of 5G technology presents an opportunity to revolutionize connectivity in the Philippines. Faster internet speeds and lower latency can support innovations in telemedicine, online education, and e-commerce, particularly in underserved communities.

Affordable Financing Options:
Telecom companies and financial institutions can work together to provide installment plans and microfinancing solutions that make smartphones and data plans more accessible to lower-income individuals.

Community-Based Digital Training:
NGOs and educational institutions can play a vital role in providing grassroots-level training programs that focus on digital literacy, helping bridge the knowledge gap and enabling Filipinos to participate fully in the digital economy.

Localized Solutions:
Technology companies can develop localized apps and platforms that cater to the unique needs of Filipino users, such as content in local languages, financial inclusion tools, and services tailored for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

The Role of Government Initiatives

The Philippine government has taken proactive steps to improve technological accessibility, recognizing its importance for economic growth and social development. Initiatives such as the National Broadband Plan (NBP) aim to expand internet coverage and lower costs by developing a national fiber optic backbone. Meanwhile, the recently passed SIM Card Registration Act and the push for digital ID systems under the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) are steps towards enhancing cybersecurity and streamlining access to online services.

Conclusion

The accessibility of technology in the Philippines is a story of both remarkable progress and persistent challenges. While millions of Filipinos have embraced the digital age, gaps in infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy continue to hinder full inclusion. To ensure that all Filipinos can reap the benefits of digital transformation, a concerted effort from the government, private sector, and civil society is needed. With strategic investments and targeted policies, the Philippines has the potential to bridge the digital divide and create a more inclusive and connected future for all its citizens.",1
65,GPT4o-mini,"The youth of the Philippines have long been considered the hope of the nation. As inheritors of the country's future, they play a pivotal role in shaping its political landscape. In recent years, the involvement of young Filipinos in political discourse, activism, and governance has grown significantly, reflecting their desire to create meaningful change. Their influence extends beyond traditional political avenues, embracing digital platforms and grassroots movements to drive social and political transformation.

Historical Involvement of Filipino Youth in Politics

Throughout Philippine history, the youth have been instrumental in key political movements. The Katipunan, a secret revolutionary society that fought against Spanish colonization, was founded by young revolutionaries like Andres Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto. Decades later, during the Martial Law era in the 1970s, student activists courageously voiced their opposition to the Marcos dictatorship, organizing protests and demanding democratic reforms.

Fast forward to the present day, and the Filipino youth continue to wield significant political influence. The 2016 and 2022 national elections saw record-breaking youth voter registration and participation, highlighting their increasing interest in shaping the country's leadership and policies.

The Digital Revolution and Political Awareness

One of the most profound ways in which the youth have influenced Philippine politics is through digital platforms. Social media has become a powerful tool for political engagement, enabling young Filipinos to stay informed, share their views, and mobilize others. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become battlegrounds for political discourse, fact-checking, and advocacy.

Digital activism has empowered the youth to challenge misinformation, hold leaders accountable, and push for transparency in governance. Online campaigns addressing issues such as climate change, corruption, and human rights violations have gained traction, often leading to real-world actions and policy discussions.

Youth Participation in Governance

Beyond social media activism, young Filipinos are increasingly entering the realm of governance and policymaking. Youth-led organizations and initiatives have emerged to bridge the gap between government and the younger generation. The Sangguniang Kabataan (SK), a youth council within local government units, serves as an avenue for young leaders to engage in public service and policymaking.

While the SK has faced criticism for inefficiency and corruption, recent reforms aim to improve its credibility and effectiveness. With proper guidance and genuine commitment, the youth can harness the potential of the SK to address community issues and advocate for meaningful policies.

Challenges Facing the Youth in Political Engagement

Despite their enthusiasm and potential, the youth face numerous challenges in their political involvement. Misinformation, political disillusionment, and economic constraints often hinder their ability to engage effectively. Some young Filipinos feel discouraged by systemic corruption and the perception that their voices are not being heard.

Additionally, the commercialization of politics and the prevalence of traditional political dynasties present barriers to genuine youth representation. Overcoming these challenges requires sustained efforts in political education, capacity-building, and the promotion of youth-centric policies.

The Way Forward: Empowering the Filipino Youth

To maximize the impact of youth in shaping Philippine politics, various stakeholders must collaborate in fostering an environment that nurtures their political engagement. Schools and universities should strengthen civic education programs, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to critically analyze political issues and engage in constructive dialogue.

Moreover, policymakers and civil society organizations must create more platforms for youth participation in decision-making processes. Encouraging mentorship programs, youth summits, and policy dialogues can help bridge the gap between young people and political leaders.

Lastly, the youth themselves must continue to embrace their role as catalysts for change. Whether through activism, public service, or community involvement, their collective efforts can drive the Philippines toward a more inclusive and progressive political landscape.

Conclusion

The Filipino youth are not just the future of the nation; they are its present. Their growing influence in shaping Philippine politics is a testament to their passion, resilience, and commitment to a better tomorrow. With their continued engagement and empowerment, they hold the power to transform the country's political system and pave the way for a more just and democratic society.",1
66,GPT4o-mini,"For decades, the concept of federalism has been a recurring theme in the political discourse of the Philippines. Advocates argue that it holds the key to balanced regional development and empowerment, while critics warn of potential economic disparities and governance complications. As the debate continues, it is crucial to analyze the benefits, challenges, and the viability of federalism in the context of the Philippines.

Understanding Federalism

Federalism is a system of government that divides power between a central authority and regional governments. Unlike the current unitary system in the Philippines, where authority is highly centralized in Manila, federalism proposes the establishment of autonomous regions with the power to legislate, implement policies, and manage resources according to their local needs.

Countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany have successfully implemented federal systems, allowing regions to address their unique challenges while maintaining national unity. However, for the Philippines, a nation of over 7,000 islands with diverse cultural, linguistic, and economic landscapes, the transition to federalism presents both opportunities and hurdles.

The Case for Federalism

1. Regional Empowerment and Development

Proponents argue that federalism can lead to more equitable development by allowing regions to harness their own resources and craft policies tailored to their specific needs. Under the current centralized system, resource-rich but geographically distant regions, such as Mindanao, often receive disproportionately less funding and attention compared to Metro Manila. Federalism could bridge these gaps by giving regional governments control over revenue generation and expenditure.

2. Decentralization of Power

Federalism offers an opportunity to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption by limiting the concentration of power in the national government. Local leaders, being more attuned to their constituents' needs, could implement policies more effectively without excessive bureaucratic red tape.

3. Preservation of Cultural Identity

With the Philippines' rich tapestry of cultures and languages, federalism could provide a framework for greater cultural expression and preservation. Regions with distinct identities, such as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), could benefit from greater autonomy to promote their own cultural and religious practices.

4. Economic Competitiveness

A federal system may encourage healthy competition among regions, fostering economic growth and innovation. With greater autonomy, regions could attract investments by offering incentives tailored to their local economies, further diversifying the country's economic base.

Challenges of Federalism in the Philippines

1. Economic Disparities

A major concern regarding federalism is the uneven distribution of wealth among regions. Some provinces, particularly in Luzon, have thriving economies, while others, such as those in Eastern Visayas or Mindanao, struggle with poverty and underdevelopment. Critics argue that federalism could exacerbate these inequalities, with wealthier regions advancing while poorer ones fall further behind.

2. Political Dynasties and Corruption

The Philippines has long struggled with entrenched political dynasties and corruption. Critics fear that federalism could empower local elites even further, allowing them to consolidate power and resources within their regions without adequate checks and balances from the central government.

3. Implementation Costs

Transitioning to a federal system would require a complete overhaul of the current government structure, including the creation of new regional administrations, legal frameworks, and resource allocation mechanisms. This shift could be costly and time-consuming, potentially diverting funds away from crucial services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

4. National Unity Concerns

There are fears that federalism could lead to regionalism and fragmentation, weakening national unity. The prospect of autonomous regions crafting their own policies and regulations may create inconsistencies in governance and economic strategy, potentially causing tensions between regions and the central government.

Proposed Federalism Models for the Philippines

Several models have been proposed for the Philippines' shift to federalism, with the most prominent being:

The Duterte Administration's Proposed Federal Charter: This model aimed to establish 18 federated regions with a strong federal government overseeing national concerns such as defense, foreign affairs, and monetary policy.

The Bayanihan Federalism Model: Advocated by the Consultative Committee under President Duterte, this model emphasized inclusivity and social justice, with a focus on equitable resource distribution.

The Pimentel Model: Proposed by former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr., this plan divides the country into 11 federal states based on cultural and economic considerations, granting significant autonomy to each region.

Is Federalism the Right Path for the Philippines?

The answer to whether federalism is suitable for the Philippines is not a simple one. While the system promises greater regional autonomy, decentralization, and cultural preservation, it also presents risks such as increased disparities, political entrenchment, and governance inefficiencies.

The success of federalism would largely depend on meticulous planning, proper execution, and a strong legal framework to ensure accountability, transparency, and fair resource distribution. Strengthening local governance, investing in infrastructure, and addressing corruption must be prioritized to ensure a smooth transition.

Ultimately, the debate over federalism should go beyond political rhetoric and be grounded in comprehensive studies, public consultations, and a clear roadmap that considers the country's socio-political landscape. Whether through constitutional reform or incremental decentralization, the goal should be a governance model that best serves the Filipino people.

Conclusion

Federalism presents a bold vision for the Philippines—one that could empower regions, foster economic growth, and promote cultural diversity. However, without the necessary safeguards, it could also deepen existing divisions and economic inequalities. As the nation grapples with this crucial decision, it is imperative to weigh the potential benefits against the risks and determine whether federalism truly offers a path to a more prosperous and united Philippines.",1
67,GPT4o-mini,"In the Philippines, the integrity of electoral processes is paramount to sustaining a robust democracy. A critical component of this integrity is the transparency of election campaign finances, which ensures that candidates and political parties operate within legal frameworks and maintain public trust. Over the years, the Philippines has established laws and regulations aimed at promoting financial transparency during elections. However, challenges persist, necessitating continuous evaluation and reform.

Legal Framework Governing Campaign Finance

The Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881) serves as the primary legislation governing electoral processes, including campaign finance. Sections 106 to 109 of the Code mandate that every candidate and treasurer of a political party maintain detailed records of all contributions received and expenditures incurred. These records must include the amount and date of each contribution, the full name and address of contributors, and detailed accounts of expenditures. Furthermore, candidates and party treasurers are required to preserve these records for at least three years after the election and produce them for inspection upon request by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) or its authorized representatives. 
ELIBRARY

To prevent undue influence and maintain the integrity of the electoral process, the law prohibits certain entities from making contributions for partisan political activities. These entities include public or private financial institutions, natural and juridical persons operating public utilities or exploiting natural resources, those holding contracts with the government, and foreign nationals or corporations. Additionally, officials and employees in the civil service and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines are barred from making such contributions.

COMELEC's Initiatives to Enhance Transparency

In its ongoing efforts to combat vote-buying and ensure fair elections, COMELEC has implemented measures such as the ""money ban."" This policy prohibits individuals from carrying, possessing, or transporting cash amounts of ₱500,000 or more during specific periods surrounding elections. The ban aims to deter vote-buying by limiting the circulation of large sums of money that could be used to influence voters. Exceptions are made for authorized persons, such as businesspersons and disbursement officials, who can demonstrate legitimate reasons for carrying substantial amounts of cash. 
PHILIPPINE INFORMATION AGENCY

Challenges in Enforcing Financial Transparency

Despite the established legal framework and COMELEC's initiatives, challenges in enforcing campaign finance transparency persist. Instances of non-compliance with reporting requirements, underreporting of contributions and expenditures, and the use of illicit funds continue to undermine the integrity of elections. The case of Alice Guo, the former mayor of Bamban, Tarlac province, illustrates the complexities involved. Guo faced allegations of involvement in financial scams and other illicit activities, raising concerns about the potential for illegal funds to infiltrate political campaigns and the adequacy of existing oversight mechanisms. 
THE GUARDIAN

Recommendations for Strengthening Campaign Finance Transparency

To address these challenges and bolster the transparency of election campaign finances in the Philippines, several measures can be considered:

Enhancing Monitoring and Enforcement: Strengthening the capacity of COMELEC to monitor campaign finances and enforce regulations is crucial. This includes investing in technology to track contributions and expenditures in real-time and increasing the number of personnel dedicated to oversight functions.

Promoting Public Access to Information: Ensuring that campaign finance records are easily accessible to the public can enhance transparency and accountability. Publishing these records online in a user-friendly format would allow citizens and civil society organizations to scrutinize campaign finances effectively.

Implementing Stricter Penalties for Non-Compliance: Imposing more stringent penalties for candidates and parties that fail to comply with reporting requirements or engage in illicit financial activities can serve as a deterrent. This could include substantial fines, disqualification from running for office, or criminal charges in severe cases.

Encouraging Civic Engagement and Oversight: Empowering civil society organizations and the media to play a more active role in monitoring campaign finances can complement official efforts. Training and resources can be provided to these groups to enhance their capacity to detect and report irregularities.

Regularly Updating Legal Frameworks: Continuously reviewing and updating the legal frameworks governing campaign finance to address emerging challenges and close loopholes is essential. This includes adapting to new forms of fundraising and expenditure, such as digital campaigns and crowdfunding.

Conclusion

Financial transparency in election campaigns is fundamental to the health of the Philippines' democracy. While existing laws and regulations provide a solid foundation, ongoing challenges necessitate continuous efforts to strengthen enforcement, enhance public access to information, and promote accountability. By implementing these measures, the Philippines can work towards more transparent and fair elections, thereby reinforcing public trust in the democratic process.",1
68,GPT4o-mini,"Mental health remains a critical yet often overlooked issue in the Philippines. Despite the passing of the Mental Health Act in 2018, which aimed to integrate mental health services into the country's public health system, deep-rooted stigma continues to hinder progress. Societal perceptions, cultural beliefs, and economic barriers all contribute to the difficulty of addressing mental health concerns openly. As the nation grapples with increasing cases of depression, anxiety, and suicide, it becomes imperative to challenge the stigma and create a more supportive environment for those struggling with their mental well-being.

The Cultural Stigma Surrounding Mental Health

In Filipino culture, mental health issues are frequently misunderstood and, in many cases, dismissed entirely. Traditional values that emphasize resilience, family reputation, and religious faith often discourage individuals from seeking professional help. The concept of ""hiya"" (shame) plays a significant role in perpetuating silence, as individuals fear being perceived as weak or burdening their families with their struggles.

Additionally, there remains a prevailing belief that mental health problems are simply a result of a lack of faith or personal weakness. Phrases such as ""Dasal lang yan"" (Just pray) or ""Kaya mo yan"" (You can do it) reflect the cultural inclination to downplay psychological struggles and promote a ""grin and bear it"" mentality. While faith and perseverance are valuable coping mechanisms, they should not replace professional intervention when necessary.

The Role of Media and Misinformation

Media representation in the Philippines has also contributed to the stigma surrounding mental health. Television shows and films often portray individuals with mental illnesses as violent, unstable, or comical, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. These portrayals contribute to public fear and misunderstanding, discouraging those who need help from stepping forward.

Social media, while a potential tool for awareness, can also spread misinformation about mental health. Misinformed advice, self-diagnosis, and stigmatizing language can further alienate those seeking help and reinforce misconceptions within the community.

Barriers to Mental Health Care

Even for those who recognize the importance of mental health, access to professional help remains a significant challenge. In many rural areas, mental health services are either nonexistent or severely lacking, forcing individuals to travel long distances to seek care. The cost of therapy and psychiatric medications can be prohibitive for lower-income families, making mental health care a privilege rather than a right.

Additionally, there is a shortage of trained mental health professionals in the Philippines. According to the Department of Health, there is a stark disparity between the number of individuals requiring mental health services and the available professionals to meet those needs. This shortage leads to long waiting times, inadequate treatment, and further discouragement from seeking help.

Steps Toward Breaking the Stigma

Addressing the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach involving government intervention, community support, and educational initiatives.

1. Government Initiatives and Policy Implementation

While the passage of the Mental Health Act was a significant step forward, full implementation and funding remain crucial. The government must ensure that mental health services are integrated into primary health care centers nationwide, making them accessible to all Filipinos. Training for healthcare providers in mental health awareness and treatment should be prioritized to equip them with the necessary skills to identify and address mental health issues effectively.

2. Public Awareness Campaigns

Awareness campaigns can play a vital role in normalizing conversations about mental health. Social media influencers, celebrities, and local leaders can use their platforms to educate the public and share personal experiences, helping to break down stereotypes and encourage open discussions. National campaigns such as ""#UsapTayo"" (Let's Talk) have already made strides in this area, but more efforts are needed to reach all communities.

3. Incorporating Mental Health Education

Educational institutions should integrate mental health awareness into their curriculum. Teaching students about mental well-being, coping mechanisms, and the importance of seeking help can foster a culture of acceptance and empathy from an early age. Guidance counselors should also receive specialized training to support students facing mental health challenges.

4. Community-Based Support Systems

Grassroots initiatives, such as mental health support groups and peer counseling programs, can provide accessible and relatable support for those in need. Barangay health workers and community leaders should be trained to recognize signs of mental distress and offer initial support or referrals to appropriate services.

5. Encouraging Workplace Mental Health Programs

Employers should be encouraged to implement mental health policies in the workplace. Providing mental health days, offering employee assistance programs, and fostering a supportive work environment can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being.

Moving Forward

Breaking the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires collective effort and a shift in cultural attitudes. By fostering open conversations, increasing access to mental health services, and challenging harmful stereotypes, the country can create a more compassionate and understanding society. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and acknowledging this reality is the first step toward meaningful change.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a Philippines where individuals feel empowered to seek help without fear of judgment, where mental well-being is prioritized, and where no one has to suffer in silence.",1
69,GPT4o-mini,"The Philippines, with its rapidly growing urban centers, faces significant challenges in urban congestion and housing shortages. These issues not only hinder economic progress but also impact the quality of life for millions of Filipinos.

The Urbanization Surge

In recent decades, the Philippines has experienced a notable shift from rural to urban living. Cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have become magnets for individuals seeking better employment opportunities and access to services. However, this rapid urbanization has led to overcrowded cities, strained infrastructure, and a burgeoning demand for housing.

The Traffic Conundrum

Metro Manila, the nation's capital region, epitomizes the challenges of urban congestion. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimates that the Philippines loses approximately Php 3.5 billion daily due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila, amounting to Php 1.27 trillion annually. This congestion not only results in lost productivity but also contributes to environmental degradation and increased stress among commuters.

Housing Shortfalls

The surge in urban migration has outpaced the development of affordable housing. The Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) estimates that there are about 1.4 million informal settler families nationwide, with 40% residing in Metro Manila. The total housing units needed this year are projected to reach 6.3 million, with private sector estimates suggesting that the required housing units could reach 12.5 million by 2030. This shortage has led to the proliferation of informal settlements, where residents often lack access to basic services and are vulnerable to environmental hazards.

Government Initiatives

Recognizing the gravity of the housing crisis, the government launched the Pambansang Pabahay Para sa Pilipino Program (4PH) in September 2022. The program aims to build 1 million housing units annually to address the backlog of 6.5 million units. As of April 2023, approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million housing sites have been initiated under this program. Additionally, in July 2023, President Bongbong Marcos issued Executive Order No. 34, directing all National Government Agencies and Instrumentalities, including Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), as well as Local Government Units (LGUs), to submit a detailed inventory of suitable lands for housing to support the program's implementation.

Innovative Urban Planning: The 15-Minute City

To combat urban congestion, some developers are embracing the concept of the ""15-Minute City."" This urban planning model envisions that all essential services—workplaces, schools, healthcare, and recreational facilities—are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from residents' homes. In Metro Manila, developments like MyTown, a network of dormitories near major business districts, exemplify this approach. Residents benefit from reduced commute times, leading to improved productivity and well-being.

The Way Forward

Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multifaceted approach:

Infrastructure Development: Investing in efficient public transportation systems can alleviate traffic congestion and reduce the reliance on private vehicles.

Affordable Housing: Accelerating the construction of affordable housing units and ensuring their strategic location can help accommodate the growing urban population.

Urban Decentralization: Encouraging the development of secondary cities can distribute economic activities more evenly and reduce the pressure on major urban centers.

Sustainable Urban Planning: Implementing concepts like the 15-Minute City can enhance the quality of urban life and promote environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, while the challenges of urban congestion and housing shortages in the Philippines are significant, strategic planning, robust government initiatives, and innovative urban development models offer a pathway to more livable and sustainable cities for future generations.",1
70,GPT4o-mini,"Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges facing the Philippines today. As an archipelago with over 7,600 islands, the country is uniquely vulnerable to the devastating effects of plastic waste, which threatens marine ecosystems, public health, and economic stability. Despite numerous initiatives and policies aimed at addressing the issue, plastic pollution continues to escalate, demanding urgent and collective action.

The Scope of the Problem

The Philippines is among the world's top contributors to plastic waste, with studies indicating that the country generates approximately 2.7 million tons of plastic waste annually. Alarmingly, around 20% of this plastic ends up in the ocean. The nation's reliance on single-use plastics, such as sachets and plastic bags, exacerbates the crisis. These products are deeply embedded in Filipino culture and consumer habits due to their affordability and convenience, but they come at an immense environmental cost.

One of the key contributors to the plastic waste problem is the lack of efficient waste management infrastructure. In many areas, particularly in urban centers and coastal communities, improper disposal practices, such as open dumping and burning, are prevalent. The absence of proper recycling facilities and segregation practices further complicates efforts to mitigate the crisis.

Impact on Marine Ecosystems

As an island nation, the Philippines boasts rich marine biodiversity, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves that serve as habitats for countless species. However, plastic pollution poses a severe threat to these ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement, which can result in injury or death. Microplastics, tiny plastic particles that originate from larger debris breaking down, have also infiltrated the food chain, posing potential health risks to humans.

Additionally, plastic waste contributes to the destruction of coral reefs, a vital source of livelihood for millions of Filipinos who depend on fishing and tourism. Coral reefs suffocated by plastic debris experience reduced growth rates and increased susceptibility to disease, further threatening the country's food security and economic sustainability.

Public Health Concerns

Beyond environmental impacts, plastic pollution has significant implications for public health in the Philippines. Poorly managed plastic waste often clogs drainage systems, leading to widespread flooding during the rainy season. Floodwaters can become breeding grounds for diseases such as dengue fever and leptospirosis, posing severe health risks to communities.

Moreover, the burning of plastic waste, a common practice in many rural and urban areas, releases toxic chemicals into the air. These pollutants, including dioxins and furans, are known to cause respiratory diseases, hormonal imbalances, and even cancer.

Government Initiatives and Challenges

In response to the growing crisis, the Philippine government has introduced various policies and programs aimed at reducing plastic pollution. The Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (Republic Act 9003) was a landmark legislation designed to promote waste reduction, recycling, and proper disposal. However, implementation at the local level has been inconsistent, hindered by a lack of funding, enforcement, and public awareness.

More recently, several local governments have enacted ordinances banning single-use plastics, such as plastic straws and bags. While these efforts are commendable, they often face resistance from businesses and consumers who rely on these products for their daily needs.

Corporate Responsibility and Consumer Action

The private sector plays a crucial role in combating plastic pollution in the Philippines. Major corporations, particularly those in the food and beverage industry, are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable packaging alternatives and reduce their plastic footprint. Some companies have responded by implementing take-back programs, promoting reusable packaging, and investing in biodegradable alternatives.

Consumers, too, have a role to play in addressing the crisis. Small changes in daily habits, such as using reusable bags, bottles, and containers, can collectively make a significant impact. Public education and awareness campaigns are essential in encouraging behavioral changes and fostering a culture of environmental responsibility.

Innovative Solutions and the Path Forward

While the plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines is daunting, there are innovative solutions that offer hope. Community-based recycling initiatives, such as ""eco-bricks"" made from compressed plastic waste, provide creative ways to repurpose plastics and reduce landfill contributions. Additionally, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and advocacy groups have been instrumental in spearheading beach clean-ups, policy advocacy, and awareness campaigns.

Technology and scientific research can also play a role in addressing the crisis. Emerging solutions, such as biodegradable plastics derived from natural materials and plastic-eating bacteria, hold promise in reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste.

Conclusion: A Call to Collective Action

The plastic pollution crisis in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach that involves government action, corporate responsibility, and public participation. Strengthening waste management systems, enforcing existing regulations, and fostering innovation are essential steps toward a cleaner and more sustainable future.

Every Filipino has a role to play in combating plastic pollution, whether through responsible consumption, advocacy, or community involvement. By working together, the Philippines can protect its precious natural resources and ensure a healthier, more sustainable environment for future generations.",1
71,Llama3.2,"As one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, the Philippines has been touted as a beacon of hope for economic development and prosperity. However, beneath its impressive GDP growth rate lies a stark reality that has left millions of Filipinos struggling to make ends meet. The country's income inequality crisis is a ticking time bomb, threatening to destabilize social cohesion and undermine the very foundations of democracy.

The numbers are alarming. According to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country's Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, has been steadily increasing over the past two decades. In 2020, it reached a staggering 40.3, ranking the Philippines alongside South Africa and Brazil as one of the most unequal countries in the world. This means that nearly half of the population lives below the poverty line, with many more struggling to survive on meager incomes.

The effects of income inequality are far-reaching and devastating. Families are torn apart as parents sacrifice their own well-being for the sake of their children, who often drop out of school or enter the workforce at an early age to support their families. Communities are fragmented, with the rich and powerful wielding disproportionate influence over local politics and development projects.

The root causes of income inequality in the Philippines are complex and multifaceted. One major factor is the country's labor market, which has been driven by a series of neoliberal reforms that prioritize foreign investment and economic growth over social welfare and job security. The resulting ""gig economy"" has created an army of precarious workers who are denied basic rights and protections.

Another significant contributor to income inequality is the Philippines' skewed distribution of wealth. According to a report by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the country's wealthiest 10% hold over 30% of its total wealth, while the bottom 40% have less than 1%. This concentration of wealth has been fueled by decades of crony capitalism and corruption, which has allowed a small elite to accumulate vast fortunes at the expense of the majority.

The government's response to income inequality has been woefully inadequate. While President Rodrigo Duterte has made some token gestures towards social welfare and poverty reduction, his administration's focus on economic growth and infrastructure development has largely ignored the needs of the most vulnerable segments of society.

In recent years, there have been calls for a more radical approach to addressing income inequality in the Philippines. Some advocates have proposed a wealth tax or inheritance tax to redistribute wealth and fund social programs. Others have suggested implementing a universal basic income (UBI) to ensure that every citizen has access to a minimum standard of living.

However, such proposals are often met with fierce resistance from politicians and business leaders who see them as threats to economic growth and stability. The Philippines is a major recipient of foreign investment, and its government has been reluctant to implement policies that might alienate potential investors or stifle economic development.

As the global conversation around income inequality continues to grow, it is clear that the Philippines cannot afford to ignore this crisis any longer. The country needs a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of poverty and inequality, while also promoting inclusive growth and social welfare. This requires a fundamental transformation of its economic policies and institutions, as well as a renewed commitment to social justice and human rights.

One potential solution is the implementation of progressive taxation, which would shift the burden of taxation from the poor and middle class to the wealthy elite. Another approach could be to increase access to education and job training programs, which would enable more Filipinos to acquire skills and secure better-paying jobs.

Ultimately, addressing income inequality in the Philippines will require a sustained effort from government, civil society, and the private sector. It demands a willingness to challenge entrenched interests and power structures, while also promoting greater economic inclusivity and social cohesion.

As we look to the future, it is clear that the Philippines cannot afford to ignore its income inequality crisis any longer. The country has a unique opportunity to learn from other nations and pioneer new models of inclusive growth and poverty reduction. By working together, we can build a more just and equitable society for all Filipinos – where everyone has access to opportunities and resources to thrive.

72,Llama3.2,"As one of the world's top remittance-receiving countries, the Philippines has long been synonymous with the sacrifices made by its Overseas Foreign Workers (OFWs). These dedicated individuals have been the backbone of our economy for decades, sending home billions of pesos every year to support their families and loved ones back home. However, despite their immense contributions, OFWs continue to face unimaginable hardships and exploitation.

The Philippine government has often touted OFWs as a symbol of national pride, highlighting their dedication and resilience in the face of adversity. And while it is true that many OFWs embody these traits, it is equally important to acknowledge the numerous challenges they face on the job and back home.

One of the most significant issues affecting OFWs is the lack of adequate protection and support from their employers. Many OFWs are forced to work in hazardous conditions, with minimal benefits and no social security. They are often subjected to physical and emotional abuse, as well as exploitation by unscrupulous employers who take advantage of their vulnerability.

The Philippine government has implemented various measures to address these concerns, including the passage of the Migrant Workers Act of 2004 and the establishment of the Department of Labor and Employment's (DOLE) Migrant Workers Division. However, despite these efforts, many OFWs continue to suffer from poor working conditions and inadequate compensation.

Another critical issue affecting OFWs is the lack of access to quality healthcare and social services back home. Many OFWs face long waiting periods for medical treatment, and those who fall ill often have to rely on their families or charitable organizations for support.

The economic impact of OFWs cannot be overstated. According to a report by the World Bank, remittances from OFWs account for approximately 10% of the country's GDP, making them a crucial component of our economy. In fact, remittances have been instrumental in mitigating poverty and reducing income inequality in the Philippines.

However, despite their significance, OFWs often receive little to no credit for their contributions to the Philippine economy. Their sacrifices are frequently overlooked, and their earnings are often seen as mere pocket change by those who reap the benefits of their labor.

This oversight is particularly galling given the historical injustices faced by Filipino migrants abroad. For generations, Filipinos have been forced to seek employment in foreign lands, often under exploitative conditions. The United States, Japan, and other major economies have long exploited Filipino migrant laborers, denying them basic rights and protections.

In recent years, however, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of OFWs to our economy and society. The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives aimed at improving working conditions and providing support services for OFWs, including the establishment of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).

The private sector has also begun to take notice of the critical role OFWs play in our economy. Many companies have started to recognize the value of their migrant workers and are implementing measures to improve working conditions and provide better compensation.

As we look to the future, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being and rights of our OFWs. This requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of exploitation and neglect. It also demands greater recognition and appreciation for the sacrifices made by these dedicated individuals.

One potential solution is the implementation of stricter regulations on employers of migrant workers, including mandatory health checks and regular inspections to ensure compliance with labor laws. Another approach could be to increase access to quality healthcare and social services back home, particularly in rural areas where OFWs often reside.

Ultimately, addressing the plight of our OFWs requires a fundamental shift in how we view their contributions to our economy and society. We must recognize that these individuals are not just workers or sources of remittances; they are also human beings deserving of dignity, respect, and protection.

As the Philippines continues to grow and develop as an economy, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being and rights of our OFWs. By doing so, we can create a more just and equitable society where all individuals, regardless of their nationality or employment status, are treated with dignity and respect.

73,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, boasting some of the world's most fertile soil and diverse ecosystems. However, despite its natural endowments, the country is facing a growing crisis that threatens the very foundation of our national identity: food security.

Food security, defined as access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food at all times, is a fundamental human right. Yet, for millions of Filipinos, this right remains an unattainable dream. The Philippines ranks among the world's most food-insecure countries, with over 40% of the population relying on non-food cash income or other means to purchase basic necessities.

The root causes of our food insecurity are multifaceted and complex. Climate change is a major contributor, as rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters have led to reduced crop yields, decreased agricultural productivity, and disrupted food systems. The country's dependence on imported rice, for example, has become unsustainable due to the increasing costs associated with transportation, storage, and logistics.

Another significant factor is the Philippines' vulnerability to external shocks in the global market. Trade wars, price volatility, and supply chain disruptions have all taken a toll on our agricultural sector, making it difficult for farmers to maintain profitability and invest in sustainable practices.

Domestically, our food security situation is further complicated by inadequate policies and lack of investment in agriculture. The Philippine government's priorities have historically been skewed towards economic growth and infrastructure development, leaving the country's agricultural sector to fend for itself.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to address these challenges and prioritize food security as a national priority. The Philippine government has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting agricultural development, improving access to markets, and increasing support for small-scale farmers.

One notable example is the country's National Food Security Program (NFSP), launched in 2013 with the aim of increasing rice production and reducing import dependence. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done.

Another critical area is the need for climate-resilient agriculture. The Philippines is vulnerable to various types of natural hazards, including typhoons, droughts, and floods, which can have devastating impacts on agricultural productivity. Climate-smart agriculture practices, such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture, offer promising solutions that can help farmers adapt to these challenges.

However, despite these efforts, the Philippines still faces significant hurdles in achieving food security. One major challenge is the lack of access to basic services for small-scale farmers, including credit, extension services, and market information.

Moreover, our country's agricultural sector remains heavily reliant on monoculture farming practices, which can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices, such as permaculture and agroecology, is essential for building resilience in the face of climate change.

The solution to our food security crisis lies not just in policy or technology, but also in behavioral change. We need a cultural shift that prioritizes food sovereignty, recognizes the value of traditional farming practices, and promotes sustainable consumption patterns.

In conclusion, the Philippines' struggle for food security is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and collective action. By addressing our dependence on imported rice, investing in climate-resilient agriculture, and promoting sustainable food systems, we can build a more resilient and equitable food future for all Filipinos.

As we look to the future, it is essential that we engage in an open and inclusive dialogue with stakeholders across sectors – policymakers, farmers, researchers, and consumers. Together, we must chart a course that balances economic growth with social justice and environmental sustainability.

The Philippines' food security crisis is not just about meeting our basic needs; it's about preserving the country's rich cultural heritage and protecting its natural resources for future generations. By working together, we can create a more food-secure and sustainable future – one where every Filipino has access to nutritious, affordable, and locally produced food.",1
74,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is one of the most digitally advanced countries in Southeast Asia, boasting a growing middle class and a vibrant tech industry. However, despite its progress, the country still lags behind in terms of access to technology, particularly for rural communities.

In today's digital age, having access to technology is no longer a luxury but a necessity. It has become a key driver of economic growth, social mobility, and overall well-being. Yet, for millions of Filipinos, especially those living in rural areas, the internet remains a distant dream.

The digital divide in the Philippines is a stark reminder of the country's unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. While urban centers like Manila and Cebu have made significant strides in adopting technology, many rural communities remain disconnected from the digital world.

One of the primary reasons for this disconnect is the lack of infrastructure. Many rural areas lack access to reliable internet connectivity, making it difficult for residents to stay connected with family, friends, and businesses.

The government has implemented various initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide, including the creation of the Department of Science and Technology's (DOST) National Broadband Plan. However, these efforts have been slow to materialize, leaving many Filipinos frustrated and disappointed.

Another significant challenge is the lack of affordable technology. Many rural communities struggle to afford basic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, making it difficult for them to access online services.

The impact of this digital divide cannot be overstated. Rural communities are missing out on essential services such as online banking, e-commerce, and healthcare. They are also being left behind in the global economy, with limited opportunities for education, employment, and social mobility.

However, there is hope. The private sector has stepped up to fill the gap, with companies like Globe Telecom and PLDT launching initiatives aimed at increasing internet penetration and affordability in rural areas.

One notable example is Globe's ""Globe at Home"" program, which provides affordable internet access to rural communities. This initiative has already made a significant impact, with thousands of households now enjoying reliable internet connectivity for the first time.

Another promising development is the growth of mobile payments and digital wallets. Initiatives such as PayMaya and GCash have made it possible for Filipinos to access financial services online, increasing convenience and reducing transaction costs.

However, more needs to be done. The government must prioritize investments in rural infrastructure, including broadband networks, to ensure that everyone has access to reliable internet connectivity.

Additionally, there is a need for greater awareness about the importance of digital literacy. Many rural Filipinos lack basic computer skills, making it difficult for them to navigate online services and take advantage of new technologies.

In conclusion, the Philippines' digital divide is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. While progress has been made, much more needs to be done to ensure that everyone has access to technology, regardless of their location or socio-economic status.

As we move forward, it is essential that we prioritize investments in rural infrastructure and digital literacy programs. We must also work with the private sector to increase affordability and accessibility of technology.

By bridging the gap between urban and rural communities, we can create a smarter nation where everyone has access to the opportunities and services they need to thrive. It's time for the Philippines to become a leader in the digital age, and it starts with making our country more accessible to all Filipinos.

75,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is at a crossroads. As the country navigates the complexities of modern politics, it is clear that the youth will play a pivotal role in shaping its destiny. With over 60% of the population under the age of 30, young Filipinos are increasingly taking center stage in Philippine politics.

For decades, the Philippines has struggled with an aging leadership. The country's politicians have often been out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of younger generations. However, with the rise of social media and increased access to information, young Filipinos are now more empowered than ever to engage with politics and demand change.

One of the key drivers of this shift is the growth of youth activism in the Philippines. Organizations such as the Youth Against Corruption (YAC) and the Kabataan Partylist have become powerful voices in Philippine politics, advocating for issues such as climate change, education, and social justice.

Young Filipinos are also increasingly using social media to express their opinions and mobilize support for their causes. The hashtag #Election2019, which trended on Twitter during the 2019 presidential election, was a testament to the power of young people's activism.

However, despite these efforts, young Filipinos still face significant barriers when it comes to participating in politics. Many are excluded from the electoral process due to lack of registration or identification documents, while others may not have access to quality education or job opportunities that would allow them to pursue careers in public service.

To address these challenges, the government must prioritize initiatives that increase youth participation in politics. This includes expanding voter registration drives, improving access to education and job training programs, and increasing awareness about civic engagement and voting.

Another key strategy is to empower young Filipinos as leaders and decision-makers within their communities. This can be achieved through mentorship programs, leadership training, and opportunities for internships and volunteer work in government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The Philippines also needs to recognize the value of youth voices in policy-making. The country's current leadership often overlooks the concerns and opinions of younger generations, instead prioritizing the interests of established politicians and business leaders.

To change this narrative, the government must create more inclusive decision-making processes that incorporate diverse perspectives and age groups. This can be achieved through the establishment of youth-focused councils or advisory boards that provide input on key policy decisions.

Finally, young Filipinos need to take ownership of their own empowerment. They must demand greater representation in politics and government, and be willing to challenge the status quo when necessary.

In conclusion, the Philippines is at a critical juncture in its development as a country. As the youth population continues to grow and become more influential, it is imperative that policymakers recognize their value and empower them to shape the country's destiny.

By prioritizing initiatives that increase youth participation in politics, empowering young Filipinos as leaders and decision-makers, recognizing their value in policy-making, and taking ownership of their own empowerment, we can create a brighter future for all Filipinos. The future of Philippine politics is in the hands of young people – let us give them the tools and support they need to succeed.

76,Llama3.2,"The concept of federalism has been debated in the Philippines for decades, with some arguing that it is the only way to address the country's deep-seated regional and socio-economic disparities. The idea of a more decentralized system of government, where power is divided between a central authority and regional governments, has gained significant traction in recent years.

The current Philippine government, led by President Rodrigo Duterte, has been exploring options for federalism as a way to address the country's long-standing issues with regional autonomy and representation. The proposal aims to create a more inclusive and equitable system of governance that recognizes the diversity of regional cultures, languages, and interests.

One of the primary arguments in favor of federalism is its ability to address regional disparities. Under the current system, regional development is largely controlled by the central government, with limited autonomy for local governments to make decisions about their own affairs. Federalism, on the other hand, would grant more power to regional governments, allowing them to make decisions that are tailored to their specific needs and circumstances.

Another key benefit of federalism is its ability to promote greater representation and participation in governance. Under a federal system, regional governments would have a stronger presence in national politics, ensuring that local voices are heard and represented at the highest levels of government. This would be particularly beneficial for marginalized communities, who often feel left behind by central government policies.

However, there are also concerns about the potential drawbacks of federalism. Some argue that it could lead to greater fragmentation and instability, as regional governments may have competing interests and priorities. Others worry that a more decentralized system of government could create bureaucratic inefficiencies and duplication of efforts.

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that the benefits of federalism outweigh its costs. For example, a study by the University of the Philippines found that a federal system would lead to greater regional growth and development, as well as increased investment in public goods and services.

Another key proponent of federalism is Senator Manny Pacquiao, who has been a strong advocate for the concept throughout his career. Pacquiao argues that a federal system would allow the country to better address its deep-seated socio-economic disparities, and to create more opportunities for economic growth and development.

However, not all Filipinos are convinced of the benefits of federalism. Some argue that it could lead to greater regionalism and fragmentation, undermining the country's national unity and cohesion. Others worry about the potential costs of implementing a new system of government, particularly in terms of infrastructure and institutional capacity.

In conclusion, federalism is an idea whose time has come in the Philippines. The current system of governance has failed many Filipinos, particularly those living outside of Manila, who feel left behind by central government policies. A more decentralized system of government would allow for greater regional autonomy, representation, and participation, addressing the country's deep-seated socio-economic disparities.

While there are certainly challenges to implementing federalism, many experts believe that its benefits outweigh its costs. The future of Philippine governance is at a crossroads, and it is time for the country to consider a new era of governance that reflects the needs and aspirations of all Filipinos.",1
77,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is set to hold another historic presidential election, one that promises to be a defining moment for the country's democracy. However, amidst all the hype and excitement, a more pressing concern looms over the campaign trail - the lack of transparency in election campaign financing.

For decades, the Philippines has been plagued by a culture of corruption and cronyism in politics. The country's elections have long been marred by allegations of vote-rigging, bribery, and other forms of electoral malfeasance. One of the major contributing factors to this problem is the lack of transparency in election campaign financing.

Under current laws, politicians are allowed to raise funds from a variety of sources, including donations from individuals, corporations, and special interest groups. However, these campaigns often operate in the shadows, with little disclosure about their funding sources or expenditures.

This lack of transparency creates an environment that fosters corruption and cronyism. Politicians may feel pressure to accept donations from certain groups or individuals in order to secure support for their campaign, even if those donations come with strings attached. This can lead to a situation where politicians are beholden to powerful interests rather than the people they represent.

Furthermore, the lack of transparency in election campaign financing makes it difficult to hold politicians accountable for their actions. Without clear disclosure about who is funding their campaigns and how that money is being spent, voters have no way of knowing whether they are voting for a candidate who truly represents their interests or one who is beholden to special interests.

To address this problem, the Philippines needs to implement more robust campaign finance regulations. This could include requirements for candidates to disclose their donors and expenditures in real-time, as well as limits on the amount of money that can be raised and spent by each candidate.

Another important step would be to establish an independent agency responsible for enforcing these regulations. This agency should have the power to investigate allegations of corruption and malfeasance, and to take action against candidates who fail to comply with campaign finance laws.

The benefits of stronger campaign finance regulations in the Philippines would be numerous. For one, they would help to increase transparency and accountability in politics. By requiring candidates to disclose their donors and expenditures, voters would have a better understanding of who is backing each candidate's campaign and what policies they are advocating for.

Additionally, stronger campaign finance regulations could help to reduce corruption and cronyism in politics. By limiting the amount of money that can be raised and spent by each candidate, politicians would be less tempted to accept donations from special interest groups or individuals with hidden agendas.

Finally, stronger campaign finance regulations could help to level the playing field for smaller candidates and independent organizations. Under current laws, larger campaigns often have a significant advantage when it comes to fundraising, which can make it difficult for smaller candidates to compete.

In conclusion, election campaign financial transparency is a critical issue in the Philippines. The lack of transparency in campaign financing creates an environment that fosters corruption and cronyism, making it difficult for voters to hold politicians accountable for their actions.

To address this problem, the Philippines needs to implement stronger campaign finance regulations, including requirements for disclosure and limits on fundraising. By taking these steps, the country can increase transparency and accountability in politics, reduce corruption and cronyism, and ensure that every vote counts.",1
78,Llama3.2,"The Philippines is a country plagued by numerous social and economic challenges, but one issue that continues to affect millions of Filipinos remains shrouded in secrecy and stigma - mental health. Despite being a major public health concern, mental illness is often stigmatized and misunderstood, leading to a lack of access to treatment and support for those who need it most.

The stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines can be attributed to various factors, including cultural and social norms, lack of education and awareness, and historical experiences of colonialism and foreign influence. In many Filipino households, mental illness is seen as a personal failing or a sign of weakness, rather than a legitimate medical condition that requires treatment and support.

This stigma is particularly damaging for individuals who are already vulnerable due to factors such as poverty, lack of education, and limited access to healthcare. Those struggling with mental health issues may be reluctant to seek help due to fear of being labeled as ""crazy"" or ""weak"", leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

The consequences of this stigma are far-reaching. Mental illness is a major contributor to disability and mortality worldwide, and the Philippines is no exception. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health disorders affect an estimated 12% of the Philippine population, with depression being the most common condition.

Furthermore, the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines can have a negative impact on the economy and society as a whole. A study by the Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) found that mental health issues can lead to reduced productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism (being physically present but not fully productive), resulting in significant economic losses.

To break down this stigma, it is essential to increase awareness and understanding of mental health among Filipinos. This can be achieved through various means, including education and training programs for healthcare professionals, community outreach and support services, and advocacy campaigns to raise awareness about mental health issues.

One notable example of a successful initiative to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines is the #BreakTheStigma campaign launched by the Philippine Psychiatric Association (PPA). The campaign aims to promote mental health awareness and education through social media, public events, and partnerships with schools, workplaces, and community organizations.

Another critical step towards reducing the stigma is to ensure that mental health services are accessible and affordable for all Filipinos. This can be achieved by increasing funding for mental health programs, expanding access to healthcare facilities, and promoting the use of telepsychiatry and other innovative technologies.

In addition, policymakers must take a proactive role in addressing the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines. The government has a responsibility to ensure that mental health services are included in the National Health Act, and that policies and programs are implemented to promote mental health awareness and education.

The journey towards greater awareness and understanding of mental health in the Philippines will not be easy. It requires a sustained effort from individuals, organizations, and governments to break down the stigma and promote a culture of inclusivity and support.

However, the benefits of this journey are well worth the effort. By reducing the stigma surrounding mental health, we can create a society where individuals feel comfortable seeking help when they need it most, and where mental illness is seen as a treatable medical condition rather than a personal failing.

In conclusion, breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health in the Philippines requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, awareness, advocacy, and access to treatment. By working together, we can create a society where mental health is prioritized and supported, and where all Filipinos have access to the care and support they need to thrive.",1
79,Llama3.2,"As the Philippines continues to grow and develop, two of its most pressing challenges are urban congestion and housing shortages. The country's rapid urbanization has led to a surge in population growth, resulting in overcrowding and congestion in cities like Manila, Cebu, and Davao.

Urban congestion is a major issue in the Philippines, with commuters spending hours stuck in traffic every day. This not only affects productivity but also leads to increased air pollution, noise pollution, and stress levels. In fact, according to a study by the University of the Philippines, urban congestion costs the country's economy approximately P1.3 trillion (approximately USD 25 billion) annually.

The housing shortage is another pressing issue in the Philippines. With limited land supply and increasing demand for housing, prices have skyrocketed, making it difficult for low- and middle-income families to afford a decent place to live. According to data from the National Homeowners Association of the Philippines (NHA), there are over 2 million households living in informal settlements, with many more waiting lists for government-assisted housing programs.

The combination of urban congestion and housing shortages has far-reaching consequences for individuals, communities, and the economy as a whole. For instance, research by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) found that congested cities like Manila lead to increased health risks due to air pollution, heat stress, and reduced access to healthcare services.

Moreover, the lack of affordable housing options exacerbates social inequality in the Philippines. Families are forced to spend a significant portion of their income on rent or mortgage payments, leaving them with limited resources for other essential expenses like food, education, and healthcare. This perpetuates cycles of poverty and limits opportunities for economic mobility.

To address these pressing issues, policymakers must adopt a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes sustainable urban planning, affordable housing, and public transportation development. One effective strategy is to implement smart growth policies that encourage mixed-use development, denser settlements, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.

For example, the city of Makati's ""Smart Growth Plan"" promotes mixed-use development and efficient land use to reduce congestion and increase housing affordability. Similarly, the municipality of Taguig has implemented a ""Pedestrian-Friendly Infrastructure Plan"" that prioritizes walking and cycling infrastructure over car-centric designs.

Another critical step is to improve public transportation options in urban areas. The Philippines can learn from successful models like Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system or Hong Kong's Octopus card, which provide efficient, affordable, and reliable transportation services for commuters.

The government also plays a crucial role in addressing these issues. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHUD) should prioritize affordable housing programs that provide financing options for low- and middle-income families. Moreover, the Land Use Regulatory Board (LUB) should be empowered to enforce zoning regulations and ensure that new developments are designed with sustainability and community needs in mind.

The private sector also has a vital role to play in addressing urban congestion and housing shortages. Developers can prioritize affordable housing options, while transportation companies can invest in efficient public transportation systems. Businesses can also adopt flexible work arrangements that promote telecommuting or flexible schedules to reduce the need for lengthy commutes.

In conclusion, the Philippines' urban congestion and housing shortages are pressing issues that require a comprehensive response. By prioritizing sustainable urban planning, affordable housing, and public transportation development, we can create more livable cities where all Filipinos can thrive.",1
80,Llama3.2,"The Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, has long been known for its rich marine biodiversity and pristine beaches. However, in recent years, the country's beauty and natural resources have come under threat from a growing menace: plastic pollution.

Every day, millions of tons of plastic waste are generated in the Philippines, with much of it ending up in our oceans, rivers, and landscapes. The effects of plastic pollution on the environment, human health, and the economy are far-reaching and devastating.

One of the most alarming statistics is that the Philippines generates over 2 million metric tons of plastic waste annually, with only about 20% being recycled or properly disposed of. The rest ends up in our oceans, where it harms marine life, contaminates the food chain, and poses a threat to human health.

The impacts of plastic pollution on the environment are numerous and severe. Plastic debris in our oceans has been found to be ingested by marine animals, including fish, birds, and mammals, which can lead to blockages, nutrient deficiencies, and even death. Sea turtles, in particular, are vulnerable to plastic pollution, with millions of them entangled or trapped in plastic waste every year.

The effects of plastic pollution on human health are equally concerning. Exposure to plastic debris has been linked to a range of health problems, including cancer, reproductive issues, and respiratory diseases. Additionally, the ingestion of microplastics by humans can lead to the consumption of toxic chemicals, which can have serious consequences for our health.

Furthermore, plastic pollution is also having a significant impact on the economy. The country's tourism industry is a major contributor to its GDP, but the presence of plastic waste in popular tourist destinations is driving visitors away and hurting local businesses.

To address this growing concern, the government must take immediate action to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable practices. One effective strategy is to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies, which hold manufacturers responsible for the waste generated by their products.

For example, the country can adopt a ban on single-use plastics, such as straws, bags, and water bottles, and replace them with biodegradable alternatives. This will not only reduce the amount of plastic waste but also promote innovation in sustainable packaging materials.

Another critical step is to increase public awareness and education about the impacts of plastic pollution. Governments, schools, and community organizations must work together to educate people about the importance of proper waste management and recycling.

Individuals can also make a difference by making conscious choices in their daily lives. Using reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups can significantly reduce our plastic usage. Additionally, supporting businesses that prioritize sustainability and use eco-friendly packaging materials is essential.

In conclusion, plastic pollution is a growing concern in the Philippines that requires immediate attention and action. The government, industries, and individuals must work together to reduce plastic waste, promote sustainable practices, and protect our environment for future generations.",1
81,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines, a nation blessed with abundant natural resources and a vibrant culture, grapples with a persistent and deeply rooted issue: income inequality. This stark disparity in wealth distribution casts a long shadow over the country's social and economic landscape, hindering progress and undermining the promise of a prosperous future for all Filipinos.

A Nation Divided:

The gap between the rich and the poor in the Philippines is significant and widening. The Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality, consistently places the Philippines among the most unequal countries in Southeast Asia. This translates to a reality where a small segment of the population enjoys a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth, while a vast majority struggle to meet basic needs.

The consequences of this inequality are far-reaching and deeply concerning:

Poverty and Social Exclusion: Millions of Filipinos live in poverty, lacking access to basic necessities like food, clean water, and healthcare. This poverty cycle perpetuates itself, trapping families in a cycle of deprivation and limiting their opportunities for social and economic mobility.
Social Unrest and Instability: Extreme inequality fuels social unrest and instability. The frustration and resentment felt by the marginalized can manifest in various forms, from social protests and crime to political instability.
Limited Economic Growth: Inequality hinders economic growth. When a significant portion of the population lacks access to resources and opportunities, the overall economic potential of the nation remains unrealized.
Weakened Social Fabric: The widening gap between the rich and the poor erodes the social fabric of the nation. It fosters feelings of resentment, distrust, and division among citizens, undermining social cohesion and national unity.
Root Causes of Inequality:

Several factors contribute to the high levels of income inequality in the Philippines:

Unequal Access to Education: Quality education is crucial for social and economic mobility. However, access to quality education remains unequal, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and between the rich and the poor.
Limited Job Opportunities: While the Philippine economy has experienced growth, job creation has not kept pace with the rapidly growing population. This leads to high unemployment and underemployment rates, particularly among the youth and those with limited skills.
Land Reform Challenges: Despite decades of efforts, land reform remains an unfinished agenda. Many Filipino farmers continue to face challenges such as landlessness, low productivity, and limited access to markets, trapping them in poverty.
Corruption and Inefficient Governance: Corruption at all levels of government siphons off resources that could be used for social programs and infrastructure development, further exacerbating inequality.
Weak Social Safety Nets: The government's social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, while helpful, are often insufficient to address the complex needs of the most vulnerable populations.
Addressing the Challenge:

Tackling income inequality requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of the problem. Key strategies include:

Investing in Human Capital: Prioritizing investments in education, from early childhood development to higher education, is crucial. This includes improving access to quality education for all, expanding vocational training programs, and strengthening the skills of the workforce to meet the demands of the modern economy.
Promoting Inclusive Growth: Economic growth must be inclusive and benefit all sectors of society. This requires policies that support small and medium enterprises, promote rural development, and create decent jobs for all Filipinos.
Land Reform and Agrarian Reform: Implementing genuine land reform is essential to empower farmers and improve agricultural productivity. This includes providing farmers with secure land tenure, access to credit, and support for sustainable agricultural practices.
Strengthening Social Safety Nets: Expanding and improving social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs, is crucial to protect the most vulnerable members of society from poverty and ensure their basic needs are met.
Good Governance and Transparency: Combating corruption and promoting good governance are essential to ensure that public resources are used effectively and efficiently for the benefit of all Filipinos.
Empowering Women and Marginalized Groups: Empowering women and marginalized groups, such as indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities, is crucial for reducing inequality and promoting social justice.
Conclusion:

Income inequality is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a sustained and concerted effort from the government, the private sector, and civil society. By addressing the root causes of inequality, investing in human capital, promoting inclusive growth, and strengthening social safety nets, the Philippines can build a more equitable and just society where all Filipinos have the opportunity to thrive.

This is not merely a social justice issue; it is an economic imperative. A more equitable society is a more stable and prosperous society. By tackling income inequality, the Philippines can unleash its full potential and build a brighter future for all its citizens.",1
82,Gemini1.5-flash,"The Philippines stands as a testament to the global phenomenon of labor migration. Millions of Filipinos, known as Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), have left their homeland in search of better opportunities abroad. While their remittances have become a crucial lifeline for the Philippine economy, this reliance presents a complex paradox: progress fueled by a significant human cost.   

The Economic Lifeline:

OFW remittances constitute a substantial portion of the Philippine economy, surpassing even foreign direct investment. These funds directly impact household consumption, driving demand for goods and services, and contributing significantly to poverty reduction. Remittances have fueled infrastructure development, supported education, and improved living standards for many Filipino families.

Furthermore, OFWs contribute significantly to foreign exchange reserves, bolstering the country's balance of payments. Their skills and expertise acquired abroad can potentially contribute to the development of the domestic workforce upon their return, although the extent of this ""brain gain"" remains a subject of debate.   

The Human Cost:

However, the economic benefits of OFW remittances come at a significant human cost. The prolonged separation of families can have profound social and emotional consequences, leading to strained relationships, broken families, and even the erosion of traditional family values. Children of OFWs often experience emotional distress, neglect, and difficulties in their social and academic development.   

The physical and emotional well-being of OFWs themselves is also a major concern. They face numerous challenges abroad, including exploitation, abuse, and discrimination. Issues such as unfair labor practices, wage theft, and even human trafficking remain prevalent despite government efforts to protect their rights. The psychological toll of living and working far from home, often under stressful conditions, can lead to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.   

Beyond Remittances: A Path Towards Sustainable Development

The Philippine government must shift its focus beyond mere reliance on remittances and strive towards creating a more sustainable and equitable economic model. This requires a multi-pronged approach:

Investing in Human Capital: Prioritizing investments in education and skills development is crucial to equip Filipinos with the necessary skills to compete in the global job market and create a more robust domestic economy.
Promoting Job Creation: The government must actively promote job creation within the Philippines through policies that encourage entrepreneurship, support small and medium enterprises, and invest in key sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and agriculture.   
Addressing Root Causes of Migration: Addressing the root causes of labor migration, such as poverty, unemployment, and inequality, is essential. This requires implementing effective social safety nets, improving access to quality healthcare and education, and promoting inclusive growth that benefits all sectors of society.
Protecting the Rights of OFWs: Strengthening the legal framework for the protection of OFWs' rights, ensuring their safety and well-being abroad, and providing effective mechanisms for addressing grievances are crucial.
Harnessing the Skills and Expertise of Returning OFWs: The government must implement programs to effectively reintegrate returning OFWs into the Philippine workforce, leveraging their skills and experience to contribute to national development.
Conclusion:

The phenomenon of OFW migration presents a complex challenge for the Philippines. While remittances have played a vital role in supporting the economy, it is crucial to recognize the human cost associated with this reliance. The government must strive to create a more sustainable and equitable economic model that reduces the need for Filipinos to seek employment abroad. By investing in human capital, promoting job creation, and protecting the rights of OFWs, the Philippines can harness the potential of its human resources while ensuring the well-being of its citizens both at home and abroad.",1

Proponents of federalism argue that it offers several potential advantages:

Regional Autonomy: By devolving power to regional governments, federalism aims to empower local communities to address their unique needs and concerns more effectively. This could lead to more responsive and efficient governance, tailored to the specific realities of different regions.
Economic Development: Decentralized governance could unlock the economic potential of regions by allowing them to leverage their own resources and attract investments more effectively.
Peace and Order: In regions plagued by insurgency and conflict, such as Mindanao, federalism is seen as a potential pathway to lasting peace and reconciliation by granting greater autonomy to marginalized groups.
Reduced Centralization: Federalism aims to break the stranglehold of centralized power in Manila, fostering a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities across the archipelago.
The Roadblocks and Concerns:

However, the path towards a federal Philippines is fraught with significant challenges:

Defining Federalism: There is no single definition of federalism. The lack of a clear and universally accepted framework for federalism in the Philippine context creates confusion and hinders meaningful dialogue.
Economic Viability: Concerns have been raised about the economic viability of smaller, more autonomous regions. Some fear that smaller units may lack the resources and capacity to effectively govern themselves and provide essential services to their citizens.
Social and Political Divisions: The creation of new political units could exacerbate existing social and political divisions, potentially leading to increased regionalism and even secessionist movements.
Risk of Fragmentation: Critics argue that federalism could lead to the fragmentation of the nation, weakening national unity and undermining the country's capacity to address national challenges.
Constitutional Amendments: Shifting to a federal system would require significant constitutional amendments, a complex and politically challenging process that could face strong opposition from various stakeholders.
The Way Forward:

Moving forward, a thorough and inclusive national dialogue is crucial to address the concerns and complexities surrounding federalism. This dialogue should involve a wide range of stakeholders, including local government officials, civil society organizations, academic experts, and ordinary citizens.

Key considerations for a successful transition to federalism include:

Clear and Comprehensive Framework: Developing a clear and comprehensive framework for federalism that addresses the concerns of all stakeholders.
Economic Viability and Sustainability: Ensuring the economic viability and sustainability of federal units through mechanisms for fiscal equalization and intergovernmental cooperation.
Addressing Social and Political Divisions: Promoting social cohesion and mitigating potential risks of fragmentation through mechanisms for inter-regional cooperation and conflict resolution.
Protecting Human Rights: Ensuring that the rights of all citizens, including minorities and marginalized groups, are fully protected under a federal system.
Gradual and Phased Approach: Implementing federalism through a gradual and phased approach, allowing for adjustments and refinements based on experience and feedback.
Conclusion:

Federalism in the Philippines presents both a promise and a peril. While it offers the potential for greater autonomy, economic development, and peace and order, it also carries significant risks, including economic instability, social fragmentation, and political upheaval.

The success of federalism hinges on careful planning, thorough consultation, and a commitment to addressing the concerns of all stakeholders. Only through a comprehensive and inclusive approach can the Philippines navigate the challenges and reap the potential benefits of this ambitious undertaking.",1
87,Gemini1.5-flash,"The health of a democracy hinges on the integrity of its electoral processes. In the Philippines, the interplay between campaign finance, transparency, and the overall democratic experience is a complex and often contentious issue. While laws exist to regulate campaign spending and ensure transparency, significant challenges remain, hindering the realization of a truly level playing field and undermining public trust in government.

The Ideal: Fair Elections and Informed Voters

In a truly democratic system, elections should be contests of ideas, not of wealth. Campaign finance regulations aim to level the playing field, ensuring that candidates with merit and popular support, not just deep pockets, have a fair chance to compete. Transparency in campaign finance is crucial for several reasons:

Informed Voter Choice: When voters have access to information about the sources of campaign funding, they can make more informed decisions. They can assess whether candidates are beholden to special interests or truly represent the will of the people.
Reduced Corruption: Transparent campaign finance helps to deter corruption by making it more difficult for candidates to engage in illicit activities such as money laundering, bribery, and the use of undisclosed funds.
Increased Public Trust: When citizens can see how political campaigns are funded and how politicians are spending public money, they are more likely to trust that their government is acting in their best interests.
Promoting Accountability: Transparency in campaign finance allows for greater public scrutiny of political activities. Citizens and civil society organizations can monitor campaign spending, identify potential conflicts of interest, and hold politicians accountable for their actions.
The Reality: Challenges and Loopholes

Despite the existence of laws regulating campaign finance, significant challenges remain in achieving true transparency and accountability in Philippine elections:

Weak Enforcement: Weak enforcement of existing laws allows for widespread circumvention of regulations. Loopholes in the law are exploited, and penalties for violations are often inadequate or rarely enforced.
Lack of Political Will: There is often a lack of political will to effectively enforce campaign finance laws, particularly when powerful politicians are implicated.
Limited Resources: Understaffed and underfunded election authorities struggle to effectively monitor campaign spending and investigate potential violations.
Opaque Sources of Funding: Many sources of campaign funding remain opaque, making it difficult to track the true origins of campaign funds.
Rise of ""Dark Money"": The rise of ""dark money"" – contributions from undisclosed sources – poses a significant challenge to campaign finance transparency.
The Impact on Democracy:

The lack of transparency in campaign finance has serious implications for Philippine democracy:

Erosion of Public Trust: The perception of corruption and undue influence in politics erodes public trust in government institutions and undermines the legitimacy of the electoral process.
Unequal Playing Field: Wealthy candidates and those with access to significant financial resources enjoy an unfair advantage, hindering the participation of ordinary citizens in the political process.
Distorted Policy-Making: The influence of large donors can distort the political process, leading to policies that favor the interests of wealthy elites rather than the needs of the general public.
Increased Vulnerability to Corruption: Lack of transparency creates opportunities for corruption, such as bribery, extortion, and the misuse of public funds.
Towards a More Transparent and Accountable System:

To strengthen the integrity of the electoral process and enhance public trust, several key steps are crucial:

Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms: Enhancing the capacity of election authorities to investigate and prosecute violations of campaign finance laws.
Closing Loopholes in the Law: Revising and strengthening campaign finance laws to close loopholes and address emerging challenges, such as the rise of ""dark money.""
Improving Data Accessibility: Making campaign finance data more accessible to the public through online platforms and user-friendly formats.
Promoting Public Awareness: Conducting public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities in relation to campaign finance.
Encouraging Civil Society Engagement: Encouraging the active participation of civil society organizations in monitoring campaign finance and advocating for electoral reforms.
Conclusion:

Transparency in campaign finance is not merely a technical issue; it is a fundamental pillar of a healthy democracy. By strengthening existing laws, improving enforcement mechanisms, and promoting public awareness, the Philippines can move towards a more level playing field in its electoral processes, where candidates are elected based on their merit and their vision for the country, not on the size of their bank accounts. This is a critical step towards restoring public trust in government and ensuring that democracy truly serves the interests of all Filipinos.",1

91,Copilot,"Income inequality remains a significant challenge in the Philippines, despite the country's notable economic growth over the past few decades. This editorial explores the causes, effects, and potential solutions to this pressing issue.

The State of Income Inequality
The Philippines has made substantial progress in reducing poverty, with the poverty rate falling from 49.2% in 1985 to 16.7% in 20181. However, income inequality remains high. The top 1% of earners capture 17% of the national income, while the bottom 50% share only 14%1. The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, was 42.3% in 2018, one of the highest in East Asia1.

Causes of Income Inequality
Several factors contribute to income inequality in the Philippines:

Educational Disparities: Access to quality education is uneven, with children from wealthier families having better opportunities to attend good schools and universities. This disparity leads to unequal job opportunities and income levels2.

Urban-Rural Divide: Economic development has been concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural regions behind. This urban-rural divide exacerbates income inequality as rural residents often have limited access to high-paying jobs and essential services3.

Political Culture: The political system in the Philippines often favors the elite, with policies and resources disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. This ""spoils system"" perpetuates inequality by maintaining the status quo4.

Labor Market Inefficiencies: Many workers are employed in low-paying, informal jobs with little job security or benefits. This situation is particularly prevalent in the agricultural sector, where a significant portion of the population is employed5.

Effects of Income Inequality
Income inequality has far-reaching consequences for the Philippines:

Economic Instability: High levels of inequality can lead to economic instability. When a large portion of the population has limited purchasing power, it can stifle economic growth and lead to social unrest2.

Social Progress: Inequality hampers social progress by limiting access to education, healthcare, and other essential services for the poor. This perpetuates a cycle of poverty and reduces social mobility2.

Health and Nutrition: Inequality affects health outcomes, with poorer households experiencing higher rates of malnutrition, stunting, and other health issues. This disparity can have long-term effects on the country's human capital2.

Intergenerational Poverty: Income inequality perpetuates intergenerational poverty, as children from low-income families have fewer opportunities to improve their socio-economic status2.

Potential Solutions
Addressing income inequality in the Philippines requires a multifaceted approach:

Improving Education Access and Quality: Expanding access to quality education, particularly in rural areas, is crucial. This includes investing in schools, training teachers, and providing scholarships for low-income students1.

Their contributions to the economy through remittances, as well as the social and cultural impacts of their work abroad, are profound. This editorial delves into the significance of OFWs, the challenges they face, and the policies that support them.

The Economic Impact of OFWs
OFWs play a crucial role in the Philippine economy. In 2022, remittances from OFWs reached a record high of $36.14 billion, accounting for approximately 9% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)1. These remittances are vital for many Filipino families, providing a stable source of income that supports household consumption, education, healthcare, and other essential needs.

The inflow of remittances also bolsters the country's foreign exchange reserves, helping to stabilize the Philippine peso and reduce the trade deficit2. This financial support is particularly important during economic downturns, as it provides a buffer against external shocks and helps maintain economic stability.

Social and Cultural Contributions
Beyond their economic impact, OFWs contribute significantly to the social and cultural fabric of the Philippines. They are often seen as symbols of resilience and sacrifice, enduring homesickness and challenging working conditions to provide for their families. This sense of duty and commitment has earned them the title of ""Bagong Bayani"" or ""New Heroes""1.

The remittances sent by OFWs are often used to improve the quality of life for their families, funding education, healthcare, and housing. This, in turn, helps to uplift entire communities and contributes to social development. Moreover, the skills and experiences gained by OFWs abroad can be valuable assets when they return to the Philippines, potentially leading to new business ventures and job creation3.

Challenges Faced by OFWs
Despite their significant contributions, OFWs face numerous challenges. Many work in low-status jobs with limited protections, making them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse1. Female OFWs, who make up a significant portion of the overseas workforce, are particularly at risk of gender-based discrimination and violence1.

The separation from their families also takes a toll on the mental and emotional well-being of OFWs and their loved ones. Children of OFWs often grow up without one or both parents, leading to potential social and psychological issues4.

Government Policies and Support
The Philippine government has implemented various policies and programs to support OFWs and protect their rights. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) regulates the deployment of Filipino workers abroad and ensures that they are provided with fair and safe working conditions4. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) offers welfare programs, including insurance, legal assistance, and repatriation services4.

Additionally, the government has established bilateral labor agreements with several countries to safeguard the rights of Filipino workers and ensure their well-being5. These agreements are crucial in addressing issues such as contract violations, non-payment of wages, and other forms of maltreatment.

Potential Solutions and Future Outlook
To further support OFWs and maximize their contributions to the economy, several measures can be taken:

Strengthening Legal Protections: Enhancing the enforcement of labor laws and bilateral agreements can help protect OFWs from exploitation and abuse. This includes providing legal assistance and support for those who face injustices abroad5.

Promoting Financial Literacy: Educating OFWs and their families about financial management can help them make better use of remittances, leading to long-term financial stability and investment in productive ventures2.

Encouraging Return Migration: Creating opportunities for OFWs to return and reintegrate into the local economy can harness their skills and experiences for national development. This includes offering incentives for entrepreneurship and job creation3.

Improving Social Services: Enhancing access to social services such as education, healthcare, and housing for the families of OFWs can mitigate the negative impacts of family separation and improve overall well-being4.

Conclusion
Overseas Filipino Workers are indispensable to the Philippine economy and society. Their remittances provide a lifeline for millions of families and contribute significantly to national economic stability. However, the challenges they face highlight the need for continued support and protection from the government and society. By addressing these challenges and implementing supportive policies, the Philippines can ensure that the contributions of OFWs are fully realized, leading to a more prosperous and equitable future for all.",1

Youth Engagement in Politics
Youth engagement in politics takes many forms, from voting and campaigning to activism and policy advocacy. The 2022 national elections saw a significant increase in youth participation, with many young Filipinos registering to vote for the first time1. This surge in political engagement was driven by a desire for change and a recognition of the power of their collective voice.

Social media has played a pivotal role in mobilizing the youth. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become arenas for political discourse, where young people share information, debate issues, and organize movements2. The digital landscape has democratized political participation, allowing even those in remote areas to engage in national conversations.

Challenges Faced by Youth in Politics
Despite their potential, Filipino youth face several challenges in the political arena:

Political Dynasties: The prevalence of political dynasties in the Philippines often stifles new voices and ideas. Young candidates without family connections or significant financial backing find it difficult to compete against established political families3.

Misinformation and Fake News: The spread of misinformation and fake news on social media platforms poses a significant challenge. Young voters, who are highly active online, are particularly vulnerable to misleading information, which can influence their political choices1.

Economic Barriers: Economic challenges also hinder youth participation in politics. Many young Filipinos are preoccupied with securing their livelihoods, leaving little time or resources for political engagement3.

Lack of Political Education: There is a need for more comprehensive political education in schools to equip young people with the knowledge and skills necessary for meaningful political participation3.

The Potential of Youth in Politics
Despite these challenges, the potential of Filipino youth in shaping the country's political future is immense. Their energy, creativity, and willingness to challenge the status quo can drive significant change. Here are some ways in which the youth can shape Philippine politics:

Advocacy and Activism: Young people have been at the forefront of various advocacy movements, from environmental protection to human rights. Their activism can push for policy changes and hold leaders accountable3.

Innovative Solutions: The youth bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to political and social issues. Their familiarity with technology and digital tools can lead to new approaches in governance and public service2.

Grassroots Mobilization: Young people have the ability to mobilize communities at the grassroots level. By organizing local initiatives and engaging with their peers, they can build a strong base of support for progressive causes1.

Political Candidacy: Encouraging more young people to run for office can diversify the political landscape. Young candidates can bring new ideas and approaches to governance, challenging the dominance of traditional political elites3.

Government and Institutional Support
To harness the potential of the youth, it is essential for the government and institutions to provide support and create an enabling environment for their participation. The National Youth Commission (NYC) plays a crucial role in this regard. Established by the Youth in Nation-Building Act, the NYC coordinates youth-related programs and policies, ensuring that the voices of young Filipinos are heard at the national level3.

Additionally, the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Reform Act of 2015 has introduced key reforms to enhance youth participation in local governance. The SK provides a platform for young leaders to engage in policymaking and community development, fostering a new generation of politically active citizens4.

Conclusion
The youth of the Philippines hold the key to the country's political future. Their demographic power, coupled with their passion and creativity, positions them as a formidable force in shaping the nation's political landscape. By addressing the challenges they face and providing the necessary support, the Philippines can unlock the full potential of its youth, paving the way for a more inclusive, dynamic, and progressive political system.

The future of Philippine politics lies in the hands of its young people. As they continue to engage, advocate, and innovate, they will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on the nation's history, driving it towards a brighter and more equitable future.",1
96,Copilot,"The concept of federalism has been a recurring theme in the political discourse of the Philippines for over a century. Advocates argue that a federal system could address the country's longstanding issues of regional inequality, inefficiency in governance, and the concentration of power in ""imperial Manila."" This editorial explores the history, arguments for and against federalism, and its potential impact on the Philippines.

Historical Context
The idea of federalism in the Philippines dates back to the late 19th century. Filipino revolutionary leaders like Emilio Aguinaldo and Apolinario Mabini envisioned a federal structure that would divide the country into three states: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao1. This vision was rooted in the desire to create a more balanced and representative government that could address the diverse needs of the archipelago.

In the modern era, federalism gained renewed attention during the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, who campaigned on a platform that included the promise of shifting to a federal system2. Duterte's push for federalism was driven by the belief that decentralization could promote regional development and address the grievances of marginalized areas, particularly in Mindanao2.

Arguments for Federalism
Proponents of federalism in the Philippines present several compelling arguments:

Decentralization of Power: Federalism would distribute power more evenly across the country, reducing the dominance of Metro Manila. This decentralization could lead to more responsive and accountable local governments1.

Economic Development: By granting regions greater control over their resources and policies, federalism could spur economic development in underdeveloped areas. Local governments would have the autonomy to tailor economic strategies to their specific needs3.

Addressing Regional Inequality: Federalism could help bridge the gap between wealthy and poor regions. By empowering local governments, it could ensure a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities3.

Cultural and Ethnic Representation: The Philippines is home to diverse cultural and ethnic groups. A federal system could provide better representation and autonomy for these groups, fostering a sense of inclusion and reducing regional tensions2.

Improved Governance: Decentralized governance could lead to more efficient and effective public services. Local governments, being closer to the people, could respond more swiftly to their needs and concerns3.

Arguments Against Federalism
Despite its potential benefits, federalism also faces significant opposition and challenges:

Risk of Fragmentation: Critics argue that federalism could lead to the fragmentation of the country. The creation of autonomous regions might encourage separatist movements and weaken national unity4.

Economic Disparities: There is a concern that federalism could exacerbate economic disparities between regions. Wealthier regions might thrive, while poorer ones could struggle without sufficient support from the central government4.

Implementation Challenges: Transitioning to a federal system would require significant constitutional changes and a comprehensive overhaul of existing institutions. This process could be complex, costly, and time-consuming4.

Political Dynasties: Federalism might entrench political dynasties at the regional level. Local elites could consolidate power, leading to corruption and patronage politics4.

Lack of Preparedness: Some argue that the Philippines is not yet ready for federalism. The country needs to strengthen its institutions and governance mechanisms before undertaking such a radical shift4.

Potential Impact on Governance and Society
If implemented effectively, federalism could have a transformative impact on the Philippines:

Enhanced Local Governance: Federalism could empower local governments to address their unique challenges and opportunities. This could lead to more innovative and context-specific solutions to local issues3.

Economic Growth: By promoting regional development, federalism could stimulate economic growth across the country. Regions would have the autonomy to attract investments, develop infrastructure, and create jobs3.

Social Cohesion: Federalism could foster a sense of belonging and representation among diverse cultural and ethnic groups. This inclusivity could strengthen social cohesion and reduce regional conflicts2.

Political Accountability: Decentralized governance could enhance political accountability. Local leaders would be more directly accountable to their constituents, leading to better governance and reduced corruption3.

National Unity: While there are concerns about fragmentation, a well-designed federal system could actually strengthen national unity by addressing regional grievances and promoting a more balanced distribution of power2.

Conclusion
The debate over federalism in the Philippines is complex and multifaceted. While it offers the promise of decentralization, regional development, and improved governance, it also poses significant risks and challenges. The success of federalism would depend on careful planning, robust institutions, and a commitment to equitable development.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt federalism should be guided by a thorough and inclusive dialogue that considers the diverse perspectives and needs of all Filipinos. By addressing the root causes of regional inequality and fostering a more inclusive political system, the Philippines can move towards a more prosperous and united future.",1
97,Copilot,"Election campaign finance transparency is a cornerstone of democratic integrity. In the Philippines, where elections are a vibrant and essential part of the political landscape, ensuring transparency in campaign finance is crucial to maintaining public trust and preventing corruption. This editorial explores the current state of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, the challenges faced, and potential solutions to enhance accountability.

The Legal Framework
The Philippines has established a legal framework to promote transparency in election campaign finance. Key laws and regulations include:

Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881): This code requires every candidate and political party treasurer to submit a full, true, and itemized statement of all contributions and expenditures related to the election1.

Republic Act No. 7166: This act provides for synchronized national and local elections and elaborates on the deadlines, required contents, and significance of submitting the Statement of Contributions and Expenses (SOCE). It also prescribes penalties for non-compliance1.

COMELEC Resolutions: The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) issues resolutions before each election cycle to set specific guidelines for the submission of the SOCE, detailing requirements such as formats, additional information, and deadlines1.

These regulations aim to ensure that all financial activities related to election campaigns are disclosed, promoting transparency and accountability.

The Role of the SOCE
The SOCE is a critical component of Philippine election law. It requires candidates, political parties, and contributors to disclose their financial activities related to the election campaign. The SOCE must include:

Contributions: A detailed listing of all contributions received, including cash contributions, in-kind donations (e.g., services, goods, property), and any other forms of support. The source of each contribution must be clearly stated, specifying the name of the donor, their address, and the amount/value of the contribution1.
Expenditures: All campaign-related expenditures must be itemized, including expenses for advertisements, rallies, staff, equipment, and transportation. The expenditures must comply with the limitations and prohibitions set forth under election law1.
Disclosure of Unspent Contributions: Any unused contributions must also be declared. Under the law, such amounts should be returned to the donors or turned over to the national treasury if donors are not identifiable1.
Challenges to Transparency
Despite the legal framework, several challenges hinder the effective implementation of campaign finance transparency in the Philippines:

Weak Enforcement: The enforcement of campaign finance laws is often weak. COMELEC, the body responsible for overseeing elections, faces resource constraints and lacks the capacity to thoroughly audit all SOCE submissions2.

Political Dynasties and Influence: The prevalence of political dynasties and the influence of wealthy individuals and corporations can undermine transparency efforts. These entities often have the resources to circumvent regulations and exert undue influence on the electoral process2.

Misinformation and Lack of Awareness: Many candidates and contributors are either unaware of the requirements or deliberately choose to ignore them. This lack of awareness and the spread of misinformation can lead to non-compliance2.

Inconsistent Reporting: The quality and consistency of SOCE submissions vary widely. Some candidates provide detailed and accurate reports, while others submit incomplete or misleading information2.

Potential Solutions
To enhance campaign finance transparency in the Philippines, several measures can be taken:

Strengthening Enforcement: COMELEC should be provided with adequate resources and authority to enforce campaign finance laws effectively. This includes increasing its capacity to audit SOCE submissions and imposing stricter penalties for non-compliance2.

Promoting Public Awareness: Educating candidates, political parties, and the public about the importance of campaign finance transparency is crucial. Public awareness campaigns can help ensure that all stakeholders understand their responsibilities and the consequences of non-compliance2.

Leveraging Technology: Implementing digital platforms for the submission and auditing of SOCEs can improve efficiency and accuracy. Online systems can facilitate real-time monitoring and make it easier for COMELEC to identify discrepancies2.

Encouraging Civil Society Participation: Civil society organizations can play a vital role in promoting transparency. By monitoring campaign finance activities and advocating for reforms, these organizations can help hold candidates and political parties accountable2.

Enhancing Legal Provisions: Revising and updating campaign finance laws to address current challenges and loopholes is essential. This includes setting clearer guidelines for contributions and expenditures and ensuring that all financial activities are transparently reported2.

Conclusion
Transparency in election campaign finance is fundamental to the integrity of the democratic process in the Philippines. While the country has established a robust legal framework, challenges remain in ensuring effective implementation and compliance. By strengthening enforcement, promoting public awareness, leveraging technology, encouraging civil society participation, and enhancing legal provisions, the Philippines can move towards a more transparent and accountable electoral system. Ensuring that all financial activities related to election campaigns are disclosed and scrutinized is not only a legal requirement but also a moral imperative to uphold the principles of democracy and good governance.",1
98,Copilot,"Mental health stigma remains a significant barrier to well-being in the Philippines. Despite recent progress, many Filipinos still face prejudice and misunderstanding when it comes to mental health issues. This editorial explores the roots of mental health stigma in the Philippines, its impact on individuals and society, and the steps needed to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment.

The Roots of Mental Health Stigma
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is deeply rooted in cultural, religious, and historical contexts. Several factors contribute to this pervasive issue:

Cultural Values: Filipino culture places a high value on resilience and endurance. The concept of ""hiya"" (shame) and ""pakikisama"" (the need to conform and maintain social harmony) often discourages individuals from openly discussing their mental health struggles1. Admitting to mental health issues is sometimes seen as a sign of weakness or a personal failing.

Religious Beliefs: In a predominantly Catholic country, mental health issues are sometimes attributed to a lack of faith or divine punishment1. This belief can lead individuals to seek spiritual rather than medical solutions, delaying or avoiding professional help.

Lack of Public Health Education: There is a widespread lack of understanding about mental health conditions. Terms like ""baliw"" (crazy) are often used indiscriminately to describe a range of mental health issues, reflecting a lack of nuanced understanding2. This ignorance perpetuates stereotypes and misconceptions.

The Impact of Stigma
The stigma surrounding mental health has far-reaching consequences for individuals and society:

Delayed Treatment: Many Filipinos delay seeking help due to fear of judgment and discrimination1. This can lead to the worsening of mental health conditions and increased risk of suicide. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 3.3 million Filipinos live with depression, yet many do not receive the care they need1.

Discrimination: Stigma leads to discrimination in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and social interactions1. Individuals with mental health conditions may face exclusion and prejudice, further exacerbating their struggles.

Economic Burden: Untreated mental health issues can result in decreased productivity and increased healthcare costs1. The economic impact of mental health stigma is significant, affecting not only individuals but also the broader economy.

Social Isolation: Stigma can lead to social isolation, as individuals may withdraw from their communities to avoid judgment1. This isolation can worsen mental health conditions and hinder recovery.

Steps Towards Change
Addressing mental health stigma in the Philippines requires a multi-faceted approach:

Education and Awareness: Increasing public awareness about mental health is crucial. Educational campaigns can help dispel myths and misconceptions, promoting a more accurate understanding of mental health conditions1. Schools, workplaces, and community organizations should be involved in these efforts.

Legislation and Policy: The passage of the Mental Health Act of 2018 was a significant milestone2. This law aims to provide accessible and affordable mental health services, integrate mental health education into schools, and raise public awareness. Continued support for such legislation is essential to ensure its effective implementation.

Accessible Mental Health Services: Expanding access to mental health services is vital. This includes increasing the number of mental health professionals, improving facilities, and ensuring that services are available in both urban and rural areas1. Telehealth services can also play a role in reaching underserved populations.

Community Support: Building supportive communities is key to reducing stigma. Community-based programs that provide safe spaces for individuals to discuss their mental health can foster understanding and acceptance1. Peer support groups and mental health advocates can also play a crucial role.

Media Representation: The media has a powerful influence on public perceptions. Promoting accurate and compassionate portrayals of mental health in the media can help challenge stereotypes and reduce stigma1. Influential personalities sharing their mental health journeys can also normalize conversations around this topic.

Encouraging Open Dialogue: Creating an environment where people feel comfortable discussing their mental health is essential. Encouraging open dialogue within families, schools, and workplaces can help break down barriers and promote a culture of acceptance1.

Conclusion
Mental health stigma in the Philippines is a complex issue that requires concerted efforts from all sectors of society. By addressing the cultural, religious, and educational roots of stigma, and by promoting awareness, legislation, and community support, the Philippines can move towards a more inclusive and supportive environment for individuals with mental health conditions. Breaking the silence and fostering open conversations about mental health is not only a matter of individual well-being but also a crucial step towards a healthier and more equitable society.",1
99,Copilot,"Urban congestion and housing shortages are two of the most pressing issues facing the Philippines today. As the country continues to urbanize rapidly, these challenges have significant implications for economic growth, social equity, and overall quality of life. This editorial explores the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to these intertwined problems.

The State of Urban Congestion
Urban congestion, particularly in Metro Manila, is a daily reality for millions of Filipinos. According to the 2023 TomTom Traffic Index, Metro Manila has the longest average travel time to traverse a 10-kilometer route among 387 cities worldwide, taking an average of 25 minutes and 30 seconds1. This congestion results in significant economic losses, estimated at around $4 billion annually due to lost productivity2.

The Philippines faces a severe housing crisis, with a backlog of approximately 6.5 million homes5. This shortage is particularly acute in urban areas, where rapid population growth and urbanization have outpaced the supply of affordable housing.

Key factors contributing to the housing shortage include:

Rapid Urbanization: As more Filipinos move to cities in search of better opportunities, the demand for housing has surged. Urban centers like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao are struggling to accommodate this influx5.

High Land Costs: The cost of land in urban areas is prohibitively high, making it difficult for low-income families to afford housing. This has led to the proliferation of informal settlements5.

Inadequate Housing Policies: Despite various government initiatives, the implementation of housing policies has been inconsistent. Bureaucratic hurdles and slow permitting processes have hindered the development of affordable housing5.

Economic Inequality: The disparity in income levels means that many Filipinos cannot afford decent housing. This inequality is reflected in the high number of informal settlers living in substandard conditions5.

Impacts of Urban Congestion and Housing Shortages
The impacts of urban congestion and housing shortages are far-reaching:

Economic Costs: Traffic congestion leads to lost productivity and increased transportation costs. It also affects the delivery of goods and services, impacting businesses and the economy2.

Health and Well-being: Prolonged exposure to traffic pollution can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. Additionally, the stress of long commutes affects mental health and overall well-being2.

Social Inequality: Housing shortages exacerbate social inequality, as low-income families are forced to live in informal settlements with inadequate access to basic services like clean water, sanitation, and electricity5.

Environmental Degradation: Urban sprawl and the lack of green spaces contribute to environmental degradation. Informal settlements often encroach on environmentally sensitive areas, leading to deforestation and pollution5.

Potential Solutions
Addressing urban congestion and housing shortages requires a multi-faceted approach:

Improving Public Transportation: Investing in efficient and reliable public transportation systems is crucial. Expanding the existing train networks, implementing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, and improving the quality of buses and jeepneys can reduce the reliance on private vehicles2.

Smart Urban Planning: Adopting smart urban planning practices can help alleviate congestion. This includes creating mixed-use developments that reduce the need for long commutes, implementing zoning laws that promote balanced development, and improving traffic management systems3.

Affordable Housing Initiatives: Increasing the supply of affordable housing is essential. Public-private partnerships can leverage funding for housing projects, while government incentives can encourage private developers to invest in low-cost housing5. Innovative solutions like modular homes and sustainable building materials can also help address the housing shortage6.

Strengthening Housing Policies: Streamlining the permitting process and reducing bureaucratic hurdles can accelerate the development of affordable housing. Ensuring that housing policies are effectively implemented and monitored is crucial5.

Community Involvement: Engaging communities in the planning and development process can lead to more sustainable and inclusive solutions. Community-led initiatives, such as cooperative housing projects and local infrastructure improvements, can empower residents and address their specific needs5.

Environmental Sustainability: Promoting environmentally sustainable practices in urban development can mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization. This includes incorporating green spaces, promoting energy-efficient buildings, and implementing waste management systems7.

Conclusion
Urban congestion and housing shortages are complex challenges that require coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and civil society. By investing in public transportation, adopting smart urban planning practices, increasing the supply of affordable housing, and promoting community involvement, the Philippines can address these issues and improve the quality of life for its citizens. Ensuring that urban development is sustainable and inclusive is not only a matter of necessity but also a crucial step towards a more equitable and prosperous future.",1
100,Copilot,"Plastic pollution is a critical environmental issue in the Philippines, posing severe threats to marine ecosystems, public health, and the economy. As one of the world's top contributors to ocean plastic waste, the Philippines faces an urgent need to address this growing crisis. This editorial examines the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to plastic pollution in the Philippines.

The Scale of the Problem
The Philippines generates approximately 2.7 million metric tons of plastic waste annually, with a significant portion ending up in the ocean1. A study by Ocean Conservancy and McKinsey identified the Philippines as the third-largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution globally1. This alarming statistic underscores the magnitude of the problem and the urgent need for effective interventions.

Causes of Plastic Pollution
Several factors contribute to the severe plastic pollution problem in the Philippines:

Single-Use Plastics: The widespread use of single-use plastics, such as sachets, bags, and bottles, is a major contributor to plastic waste. These items are often discarded after a single use, leading to significant environmental pollution2.

Inadequate Waste Management: The country's waste management infrastructure is insufficient to handle the volume of plastic waste generated. Only about 33% of waste is properly managed, with the rest ending up in landfills, rivers, and oceans3. The lack of sanitary landfills and proper waste disposal facilities exacerbates the problem4.

Urban Runoff and Improper Disposal: Urban runoff and improper waste disposal practices contribute to the leakage of plastic waste into waterways. In metropolitan areas like Manila, waste management systems are often overwhelmed, leading to significant plastic pollution3.

Economic and Cultural Factors: The ""tingi-tingi"" culture, where products are sold in small, disposable packaging, is prevalent due to economic constraints. This practice results in a high volume of plastic waste5.

Impacts of Plastic Pollution
The impacts of plastic pollution in the Philippines are far-reaching and multifaceted:

Environmental Damage: Plastic pollution poses a dire threat to marine ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion, starvation, and death3.

Economic Costs: Plastic pollution affects industries such as fishing and tourism, which are vital to the Philippine economy. The presence of plastic waste in coastal areas can lead to reduced fish stocks and a decline in tourism, resulting in economic losses for local communities5.

Social Inequality: Coastal communities, which often rely on fishing and tourism for their livelihoods, are disproportionately affected by plastic pollution. These communities face economic and health challenges due to the presence of plastic waste in their environment3.

Potential Solutions
Addressing plastic pollution in the Philippines requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach:

Policy Reforms: Strengthening regulations on single-use plastics and implementing incentives for businesses to adopt sustainable packaging alternatives are crucial steps. The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Act, which holds manufacturers accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, is a significant policy initiative6. This law requires businesses to manage the waste generated by their products, promoting sustainable practices.

Improving Waste Management: Enhancing waste management infrastructure is essential to reduce plastic pollution. This includes increasing the number of sanitary landfills, improving waste collection systems, and promoting recycling and materials sustainability6. Local government units (LGUs) play a critical role in managing waste at the municipal level.

Promoting a Circular Economy: Transitioning to a circular economy, where products are designed for reuse, recycling, and minimal waste, can significantly reduce plastic pollution7. This approach involves redesigning products and packaging to minimize waste and encouraging the use of biodegradable materials.
